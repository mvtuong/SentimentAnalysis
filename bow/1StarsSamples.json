Hi there!  I'll be right with you!  That's what you should say, any of the 10 times you walk right past the customer who is clearly and patiently waiting.  Not avoid eye contact and say nothing.  Then, when you finally have time,  let the customer finish talking before you stomp off to get what you think they need.  What is with the elitist attitude of bike shop dudes around here?  You're a bike mechanic...not an astronaut who cured cancer while drinking and say the alphabet backwards.I recently went to Serenity for a mani/pedi. My manicure was done first and the technician did a pretty good job, however she didn't clip my cuticles and the quality of work was not great for the money. Next came the pedicure which was a complete nightmare. I really liked the tech, but it was very clear he had never done a pedicure in his life. The polish was the most sloppy I'd ever seen. Thick and slimy, brush strokes everywhere due to it partially drying and him applying over and over. After that he spent at least 15 minutes trying to clean up the mess by using tons of cotton and acetone. My nails were left incredibly sloppy: polish on the nails was a mess, polish all over my toes, cotton stuck everywhere. Worse, the acetone caused more polish to run onto my toes. I had to go straight to a wedding afterwards, but I removed the polish when I got home that night. What's worse? The shaping of my nails was bizarre. Three of my toe nails were shaped like smiley faces, clipped all the way to my toe in the center of the nail and high on the edges. I was able to even them out slightly, but it will take them at least a month to grow back to a normal length. I was very disappointed with the quality especially at an Aveda salon.DONT USE YOUR CREDIT/DEBIT CARD!
Bartenders will tip them self after you leave Even if you already tip them with cash!One star reviews are really rare for me, So much so, that, if I am giving a one star review, I will usually just not even bother to write the review. 

Coach and Willie's probably deserves better, but for what we paid and the quality of food we got, I have to do what I have to do.  Here goes...

We had been given tickets to the Diamondbacks game and, not too familiar with the area, this was the first place we found. The game was starting in a little over an hour when we showed up. Even at that, we did not get bad service, the one star is primarily directed at the food, which was not good.

I get very dismayed when something on the menu sounds really good and is such a disappointment. I ordered the Baja Fish Wrap. I love fish tacos and this sounded like something in the same vein. They do give you a choice of sides. I chose the wedge salad. The fish was bland. The lavosh wrap around it was soggy and falling apart. The menu promised spicy sauce... again bland. The wedge salad was a travesty. It was just an unwieldy wedge of lettuce with a small amount of dressing on it. It took up over half the plate. When you tried to cut it it made everything slide off the other side. I gave up on it after the first few bites. It wasn't worth the work and mess. My wife had a nearly identical experience with her tequlila-lime chicken wrap... no flavor at all in any of the food.

These sandwiches and two drinks cost us over $50. Hence, one star. We won't be going back here.I will never go in this restaurant again. I have been there several times, with each visit the manager being more rude and insulting than the last time. My friends could not believe the things I told them he said to me during my last (definitely last) visit.

You can get better New York food elsewhere without the New York attitude.

Complaints to the headquarters go unanswered. So I assume Schlotzsky's does not care about customers.I sat down at 2p saw server she gave me salsa no chips. Ordered food at 210 and 230 rolled around still no food told server I had to go she said she would be right back 5 minutes later she comes with my food. I seriously had to go so I asked for a box 5 minutes later.box comes. Horrible experience.This place used to be really good. They made the best tacos (which they don't make anymore) and green chili. The green chili has gone down hill you can tell they are cutting corners. They have raised their prices which is completely unjustified due to the quality going down. This place has now become nothing more than an eye sore and nuisance to the local neighborhood. Close your doors and move on.Yesterday, we stop in for a late lunch. We decide to split a couple appetizers. While we are waiting they brought us the normal chips and salsa. The chips tasted stale and the salsa was pretty gross too. Then our food came. We ordered loaded nachos - which were far from loaded. I am still trying to figure out how they managed to put everything in one tiny corner of the plate. The second plate was the mini chimis. Oh my gosh, they were even worse! Soggy, covered in sour cream and what I think was guacamole?  They were inedible! Yuck! I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. No no noMy name is Matthew and i Ordered 2 cheese pizzas w/extra sauce. Was excited I received an email couponcoupon for a $10 pizza. Went to pick it up on way from work...and after I had a discussion with some of the employees about the coupon and number of pizzas I was  allowed by the manager James to have it honored. The staff before him said I could only have one pizza. So James settles it which was cool of him. Then I get home find out I have 2 pizzas w/o pizza sauce and only cheese. So I guess the lady that took down my order over the phone was confused. Why would anyone want only xtra cheese and  no pizza sauce?So I call James back to let him know what happen and he agreed to credit my ATM card. So least to say dinner was ruined for my kids/family. Now we are off to my son's baseball game starving. I now will wait patiently for my refund to post on my bank account. Oh what fun!i went in to purchase stamps.  I was not told how much the service charge would be beforehand and didn't know until it was rung up.  I didn't look at the stamps until I got back to my office and found that all of the stamps were at the old rate of $.45.  Now I have to go to the post office and purchase $.01 stamps.  Hopefully they are informed and using the current rates for their other shipping services!Really not sure how to rate it since the service sucks so bad. Pretend it's a 1 1/2 star I guess.

For the second time in a week I've received my Jr. Bacon Cheeseburger with no bacon. How does that happen?

Other incidents have included but are probably not limited to: a mysteriously soggy bun, buns that were harder than they should have been, missing food and other various problems typically associated with these type of eateries.

I know it's fast food but come on people. Get it together!

Also keep an eye out for your straw as this Wendy's is notorious for giving you your drink and then giving you nothing to drink your drink with. I don't know why Wendy's insists on putting the straw in the bag since they more often than not forget to.

If it weren't opened 24 hours and I wasn't such a gluten for punishment I'd never go here.

Dave was cool, this Wendy's is not!Horrible. Been in the emergency waiting room for over 6 hours to be seen for difficulty breathing and chest pains. It's so frustrating.Danny's Family Car Wash is a reminder of all that is wrong with this world.  

This is nothing less than a third world car wash with all the dirty water, inattentive labor and indifference that you would expect from people that really do not want to be there.

Look Danny, here it is bro.  If you don't want to run a car wash, do something else.  If I was in your family, I would be the one that does not talk to you.DO NOT go to the KFC on 7th ave and Thomas, we didnt learn the first time when they gave us the wrong order, but this time we went again since we were between classes at PC, we ordered our food and Alexander took our order, the chubby hispanic woman was getting it together and was busy talking loud and talking to her co workers, we got our order and decided to eat there, our order was wrong and Alexander tells her hey you got the order wrong, she starts YELLING saying no I didnt you did, we said look on our reciept he got it right, he shows her the screen and says see, then she YELLS well it says 2 3 piece dinner and he goes yeah but it says original and the other grilled, then she YELLS again and says its not my fault HUMMM if you got the wrong order since you were busy talking and not paying attention it IS YOUR FAULT, he says sorry, and she gets our order, we started eating and not even 2 mins go by when someone goes up and says my order is wrong SHE DID IT AGAIN and Alexander tells her hey you got another order wrong and she goes back into her mumbling , the food is good if they get your order rightThe summary is that I could have been better served and diagnosed by a blind monkey than I was by Dr. Lawrence Kramer and his staff.

Don't get me wrong.  I'm not normally one to be negative.  But I have never left a place of business feeling more disgusted, useless, and violated than I did today.  

My experience: I made an appointment at 11:15.  Showed up at 11:15.  Didn't get in until 12:00.  Then, my appointment with Dr. Lawrence Kramer was shorter than the time the nurse took to measure and weigh me. Dr. Lawrence Kramer cares only about getting you out as soon as you come in to make more $$$$ by seeing more patients.  

And patient beware: he'll try to get you to buy more stuff in the short amount of time he'll spend with you.  First he tried to force a chest exam on me...then it was a flu shot.  And I'm supposed to trust this guy?  He doesn't even try to diagnose the problem, and then wants more $$$ by prescribing stuff that is totally unrealated to the reason why I'm there.  

After my experience with Dr. Lawrence Kramer, I went outside and ran into one of the workers in the building.  I told her about my experience, and she asked about the doctor.  I said, 'I went to see Dr. Lawrence Kramer.'   She said, 'Go figure.  That doctor is the worst.  He only cares about the signing off on tickets.'

Enough said.  Take your kids, your health problems, and your medical insurance far away from Dr. Kramer at the Biltmore Medical Center on Highland.  Hopefully the lull in his practice forces him to reevaluate how he treats his patients.More a business then a clinic.. a certain degree of care for the animals, but in my opinion and experience, it's all about the almighty dollar there.  I felt my pet was second over how much they could nickel and dime me for.  After $$$$ dollars spent, I went to another vet who put the animal first with the cost secondary.  Again, my opinion only, not my type of vet clinic.I stayed here for a conference. My diamond stud earrings went missing from the time my husband checked out to the time the room was cleaned. (He had seen them and forgot to grab them.) Estimated time of two hours in which the earrings were left unattended.
He texted me when I was in the conference when he remembered seeing the earrings and notified security. The security person was cooperative and searched to no avail.
I sat in the lobby for the Phoenix police. I asked for a comment card. I was told a survey would be emailed to me.  No one from management met me. I am told that the employees are longstanding and have a lot to lose meaning their job if they stole the earrings. I asked if they polygraph employees. It is the police's decision apparently.
My biggest disappointment is that no one from the staff reached out. At least four employees knew of my situation, did not say my name or offer a sentence stating they were sorry about the situation. It was though I was the problem although I had not accused anyone of anything. I have to file a report for insurance. 
One star goes to the security officer. He was professional, sensitive and empathetic to my situation.I am really surprised that Salon Surreal has received such positive reviews. I mean, *really* surprised. I went (on these Yelp recommendations) and immediately wanted to call Tabitha for a salon takeover. 

I went in for a manicure/pedicure and was able to get in the same day. Parking was a bit of a struggle on a weekday afternoon but not too bad. When I walked in I was greeted by a full wall of products. That's all you see. Just this huge wall of products. 

I think Huey Lewis and the News was on the sound system, too. 

I went to check in and there were lots of young girls--none of them with fabulous haircuts--standing around the front desk. They checked me in and I waited for my nail tech, who showed up and gave me the weakest handshake ever. I almost laughed and could barely hear her. She was perfectly nice and polite, but it was just awkward. 

She took me back and gave me a class of water, which was nice, and then started on my hands. I didn't have much to say to her (and couldn't hear her over the N'Sync song on the stereo) so I just looked around as she clipped my cuticles. The place is a cluttered mess. I couldn't believe it. There's just stuff everywhere. Photos, pieces of paper, knick-knacks, stacks of towels, old chairs and nail accessories. Clutter clutter clutter. And on top of the clutter was lots of dust. It was gross. 

The decor is this weird early 90s red/black/contemporary thing going on. Oh and did I mention the music? Yeah. I admit that bad music stresses me out--I'm just that kind of person--but this was so bad that if I heard it at a bar or a coffee shop I'd turn around and walk out. And it wasn't even "dentist's office" bad. It was worse than what you'd hear at Applebee's. 

My pedicure was better because I could just sit there and let her do her thing and bury my head in a magazine. There were a lot of staff standing around still, too. One had a laptop open.

I suppose the most non-relaxing thing I experienced was the smells. This salon uses Creative nails and the lotions and accessories all reek of fake fruits and flowers. It was nauseating. 

When I left I went back to use the restroom and passed by the huge washing room and several dozen lockers where I suppose the staff keeps their stuff? It all just screamed "factory" to me. The bathroom, too, was this weird mish-mosh of contemporary (not modern) and Tuscan. 

There is nothing soothing about this salon. And as a new client I was shocked they didn't offer me a discount. Instead, I paid $90 after tip for my mani/pedi. And sure enough, my cuticles were ragged and unfinished and after a week my toenail polish is chipping. 

On Newbury Street in Boston I paid $45 for a pedicure that lasted me 3 weeks. If you like the kind of salon that's calm, relaxing, serene, and upscale, this is not your place. If you like fun and action and don't care so much if you have to go back every week because everyone there is so much fun, then this is your place. Personally, I like calm and quiet and quality.Not good.  We wanted to leave our leftovers on the table!  Sauce was way too sweet and crust was way too chewy. Definitely not going back!I do not recommend this bank due to terrible customer service, terrible website. Unfortunately I am attached to them at the hip with a mortgage until I can refinance. They literally have the worst bank website I have ever experienced. All you can really do is check balances. It usually takes multiple calls to get anything done. They repeatedly fail to send documents properly likely because they dont know how to properly update addresses. I have called many times to get addresses updated and it always reverts. I get the feeling that the employees dont care. The only reason that I would recommend would be to keep you money in a local bank since the big guys like Wells Fargo, Chase, Citi, JP Morgan etc are crooks. Stick with well rated banks like USAA.Wow I got a hair cut from a Russian lady who was very nice but did not listen to a word I said. I understand mullets are popular in the former USSR and maybe here circa 1984. But that is NOT what I wanted. I called ahead and asked if anyone was experienced in men's haircuts. When I went to the salon, I was introduced to Natasha the mullet master.If you fly from the C or D terminal, bring food or be prepared to spent plenty if very mediocre good. 
And bring a book because you WILL be delayed by the gross incompetence in Phoenix. From here, none if my flights have ever left on time.
At least the place is clean......Ordered open face brisket sand. $13 for tough meat and the meat was difficult to identify under the gallon of super sweet barbecue sauce. My eating partners salad was pretty good though.People in the hood need to learn how to follow directions. I made an online order and the driver read me what I ordered and looked at what I didn't order.If you are purchasing a car seat, breast pump or stroller from Babies R Us beware... the warranty they sell eliminates these items from the "gift card no hassle refund"

I purchased a warranty on a stroller from Babies R Us last year after the cashier convinced me that if anything happened to the stroller Babies R Us would send me a gift card to be able to purchase a new one and that I would not have to deal with the manufacturer warranty.  

When I tried to file a claim the system kept kicking me out. Then customer service at Babies R Us tells me I have to go to the store and purchase a new one then send both receipts (the one for the old one and the new one to them) then they would reimburse for the new one, but only after the manufacture warranty expires. What a pain. Who wants to do all that. They get to collect an extra $20 from people and get away with this supposed added convenience that is actually just a scam.

I will never set foot in a Babies R Us / Toys R Us again. The nerve of big business to steal $20 from the working class.This was a horrible experience.  I walked in knowing exaxtly what I wanted, and it was an item behind the counter.  I had to wait, and and inconvience an employee to help me.  When I went to pay for it, there was 5 employees up front (with 1 register going) and a few customers waiting in line.  The employess were complaining that some of their shifts were over, and were also complaining that they don't get paid enough to work past their shifts.  So again I was inconveniencing them by try to purchase something from their store.  If I owned this place and heard or saw the staff acting like this, I would fire all of them and start over with staff who would appreciate the jobIf I could, I would like give no star for this store.  The people work in the store don't have knowledge about pool.  However, they do like to tell you a story and sell you stuff more than you need.  Be aware!!I used to go here often when I went to MCC.  I admit that the food was pretty good, but the owner ruined the entire experience for me.  At the time, I was learning Japanese and wanted to try it out in an actual setting.  He yelled at me the first time I tried and told me to speak English.

Another instance, and the real reason I don't go back there, is when a friend of mine went to eat there.  After he finished, he said "Gochisousamadeshita" (a polite saying thanking the preparer of the food for the meal) and the owner muttered under his breath "Henna Gaijin" (strange foreigner).

I can understand not having the patience to speak Japanese with me, but really.....insulting someone who just thanked you for the food?  That's enough for me to never return.Waited 45 minutes after entering the room. Very rude in how they push their shots and lecture you. Choose a different place that is cleaner for your kids.This place used to be way better a few years ago when it was a Dannys Family car wash. When Full Circle took over, things went downhill. It feels like no one takes care of anything and feels a little run down. It's worth driving a few miles down the street and go to danny's instead. Probably best to avoid this place.I was grabbing breakfast for me. & a friend & went through the drive through. I ordered two #5's (bacon, egg & cheese on bagel + coffee + hash browns) and 2 orange juices.

I didn't get the coffee, but assumed they just subbed the orange juice. Not a huge deal. However, after driving away and eventually opening the bag I realized they didn't put egg on the sand witches & forgot the hash browns as well. I drove back & went in. I told the counter girl that The sandwiches were wrong & I didn't get hash browns. They gave me a new bag & I hurried off after being so delayed.

Turns out they just put egg on the already cold sandwiches I handed them back & still forgot the hash browns. 

Never again.

TheGreat food but terrible take out service. 

It's weird when a place has perfect pizza but terrible service. 

I ordered a large pie for takeout. 30 minutes later I'm there to pick it up and it's not ready. No problem, I can hang out, and the employee said it would be three minutes. 

Ten minutes later I'm just standing there, looking bored while literally five employees are just standing around, complaining that one table has someone who can't eat onions or garlic. 

I finally go up and ask someone to check on my pizza. The man I asked looked like I asked him if he could deliver a baby underwater. Just totally perplexed. Then he went and checked, and sure enough it was sitting in the back. He gives me my pizza and I ask if it's sliced, and he gives me a look and says "yah, it's sliced." I get in the car and check, and sure enough- it's either not sliced- or the biggest slice of pizza in the world. 

I go back in again and find an employee and ask to have it sliced.  Again, this request was met with utter confusion and
Finally they found someone who could use a pizza slicer. 

I'm not sure if this is the training store, or they just have crap staff, but I would avoid this location. NYPD execs would be wise to send in some mystery shoppers, I think they'd learn a lot.I was so mad after I got my car back, I almost demanded my money back. I bought the big package, whatever its called, and I could have done it better in my driveway. Part of the package was vaccuming and I had some dog hair in my car. Dog hair was STILL there when I got my car back. They didnt put any air freshener in my car even though it came with, and the guy didnt even say thank you when I gave him a tip, just ran off. (I wouldnt have tipped had I inspected my car first but they rushed me out of there). NEVER going back. Ill stick to do it yourself places.Don't visit or eat at this Denny's! They won't accept online coupons! Manager when asked why not, he gave an excuse that accounting won't take it. No way to honor veterans on this Memorial Day! Next time we're eating at a local restaurant!!!What a disappointment this place has become.  I think they have forgotten their local roots and become way to commercialized.  I visited most recently and was severely disappointed.  Not only in the overall condition of the grounds but the fact that it is clear their sole motivation is to make a $. 

They have a country store and it is very misleading, you think the majority of the good sold would be local, however this is not the case. If you look closely most of it is packaged or produced outside of Arizona or Queen Creek and then they put their own label on it.  I would expect more from a "local" farming family.  

I think the concept of the family farm is good and I commend them for their long heritage in the area. I just think they have lost sight of the bigger picture and the values that one time made them so successful.  Big is not always better. I think they would be better off concentrating on a select few events or amenities, rather than try and have so much and with so little quality.I don't think this place is even open anymore because it's not showing up on the Fairfield Inn website, but it doesn't surprise me because it was gross.

We stayed here two years ago for my sister's wedding in Scottsdale.  Scottsdale is a pretty expensive area and since we were going to be in AZ for a while we didn't want to blow all our $$ right away.  The Fairfield Inn got decent reviews everywhere, was close to where we needed to be, and  was inexpensive.  I thought because it was a Marriott chain it would at least be ok.  I wasn't expecting to be wowed, I just wanted a clean, safe place to stay for a couple nights.

It was gross.  The place was falling apart.  There was chipped paint everywhere, the pool lining had a rip in it, the cement "deck" was crumbling.  The pictures from the website obviously were from 5 or 10 years before!  Our room looked pretty clean, but it just didn't smell right and the whole time we were there I just felt gross and didn't want any of my stuff to hit the ground, lest we take home some of the funk with us.  The stairwells were dimly lit and so were the outdoor walkways between rooms.  It was creepy and super Motel-like. 

 I've never been a fan of chain hotels (restaurants or anything else for that matter) and this confirmed some of my issues with them.  They've got the name and familiarity to keep customers coming in, so they don't really have to focus on quality or service.

I was soooo happy to check out of there and since I'll be heading for another visit to Scottsdale pretty soon (have a new nephew to meet!), I'll be happy to spend a lot more money if I have to, to stay somewhere that doesn't make my skin crawl!I talked to the owner to request a 1 hour donation to deliver a cake for a 4 year old little girl in hospice. The owner was extremely rude and claimed that he gave to charity often and doubted the validity of my story. I would not recommend this place to anyone.I don't know where to begin we checked in on a Fri night in April the place was empty maybe 4-5 cars in entire place,front desk lady was talking to a guest on phone who wanted to come in that night instead of Saturday and she told them they couldn't because there were no clean rooms. We went to the coffee shop restaurant and the steak didn't taste right , didn't think too much about it until morning, Our room was dark lights are all dim and room is yellow & brown tones, I had to sleep on the pull out sofa bed, the sheets were dirty with crumbs, could tell the bed was never made,I slept on top of blanket, in morning I got up to make coffee the pot was there but no coffee filters to be able to use the pot,took a shower and only one towel in the whole place, we had two booked in our room don't understand why one towel ?Decided to go back to restaurant for breakfast how bad can you screw up breakfast and again place was empty but another couple were leaving they made a comment about the service, said he ordered steak and eggs  but steak was bad and they were walking out he complained how his room had one towel ! we said so did ours... confirmation now the night before we thought steak tasted funny. We overheard the waiter tell a table there is "No milk" they were out, its 9AM on a Saturday morning ! Coffee came in a styrofoam cup in the restaurant ! We walked out, checked out they didn't charge us for the room after we showed them 5 old cigarette butts on our non smoking dirty room balcony and pictures of the bed sheets. Too bad, has lots of potential but no service, rooms are like an apartment but dreary, pool looked okay but not sure where you would find a towel, place looks like its being run on a dime budget and I wonder if the owner knows the person at front desk is turning guests away from checking in. I would say there must be at least 75 rooms and literally there were maybe 10 cars in the parking lot .In need of an overhaul. Front desk said manager would call us but he never did.. Not a resort more like an old condo time share next to a tennis club.I've been obsessed with Flo's for years and have never had any issues until recently. I so want to leave more stars but I've been dissatisfied the last 4 or 5 times. 
- there has been a mistake in my take out orders 3 out of 5 times. The hostesses sound 15 yrs old and rush the call resulting in errors with my food that I can't send back bc I'm already home

- the portion size has dramatically downsized. I asked the waitress last time I ate there and she said "yes, there have been a few changes" 
Now, instead of getting a basket of won ton chips on the table, their new technique is to put a pile of them on one side of the entree plate so they take up space so people hopefully won't notice the skimpy portion size. I'm an average person and don't overheat, but for these prices, the amount is very skimpy

- lastly, flo has raised her prices to the point of being absurd. Maybe her locations cause her to think all her customers are rich, but I seriously can't afford to get take out anymore. Tonight I ordered 3 basic dishes for my daughter and I and it was $40 before tip.  The average dish is $12-14 which is ridiculous. Most other restaurants are $8-11. I noticed tonight the lack of flavor in the lo mein and the small number of cashews in my cashew chicken. 

The sad thing is, good chinese is so hard to find in Phoenix, but that doesn't give Flo's the right to take advantage of that fact.  2 years I wouldn't have complained but now I'm in search of a new obsessionDr. Bassett is more a legend in her own mind.  Her veneers may look good initially, but are not functional.  She does too much "prep" and you look like someone from Appalachia when your veneer inevitably pops off.  Then, she will be upset with YOU for spoiling her work and CHARGE YOU for resetting your tooth.  
Save your money and your smile--don't go here.Bad choice for a Saturday lunch.  For some reason, we were seated in the bar. No big deal I guess. Server  was not friendly about how she informed us that the cheaper priced margaritas were a pre mix....we wanted a margarita but it was just the way it was presented that made us stick to water. It took forever to get our food. One burrito and a grilled chicken salad. I'm pretty sure she forgot to turn our order in. The part that really ticked me off is that she made no mention of the delta until she brought the check. Service was lousy. I also blame their management for poor training. Food was ok.... Too many Mexican food choices to say that I will be back.Horrible parking.  If you take the parallel spaces, look out for people backing out.  If you take the regular space, look out for the parallel cars.  The best place to park is on the south side of their lot, or just past the drive thru area.
I got a little ticked off today.  I dont have a BofA checking account so I had to see a human to make a payment.  The lines were long.  Only one designated merchant teller with a lot of merchant activity, so the lines moved really slow.
Then the teller that took my payment saw that I was paying with a check from a Credit Union, so she looked up my other services and started to ask me questions about my CU checking account.  She was trying to cross-sell me.  If you want to have your employees cross sell, at least train them to what kind of products you are trying to steer your clients off of.  She could not comprehend that my CU pays me to use my checking account.  2.25% int on balances under 1,000 and rebates all atm fees up to $20.  Nothing BofA would ever offerWe walked in around 5 (there were three adults and two kids (4 and 2). There wasn't a single other person in the restaurant. The lady came out and didn't even crack a smile, and in fact, was almost bothered that we were there at all. We tried to "kill her with kindness", but she wasn't having it at all. The refused to give my two year old a place setting because "he didn't need it". We were feeling really uncomfortable and almost begging for a reason to leave, but we felt bad. We hoped the food would be better than the service so far. The server went into the back, yelled at someone back there, and then came back out. She came over to take our order about ten minutes later (we were still the only people in the place). I asked if there was any MSG in the food because I am VERY allergic to it. First she said no, and then changed her answer to, "well, maybe a little". I looked at her puzzled (and annoyed that she easily could have sent me to the hospital). I asked if it was in everything and her response was "not everything, well, yes, everything". Again. Are you serious?! Then, seeming annoyed with us, she sat down at a table near by (like standing for two minutes was just too much) and huffed under her breath. Needless to say, I threw two dollars down on the table to cover my diet coke and we left. I've never done a food review before, but I had to post about this. It was absolutely horrible. I've never felt so uncomfortable in a restaurant EVER. And, the fact that she was not going to be honest about the MSG, really irked me too. Please don't even bother going to this restaurant. We moved in down the street last year and have always been curious about it since we shop at the Frys next door. We obviously won't be back!Loyal Customer Lost

First the back story: 
I have been a loyal customer at this location in Gilbert for years, I have taken my past 3 vehicle here for regular oil changes, tries, and more. However, I feel as though I should have noticed the red flags way earlier.
I recall after a simple tire rotation, everything seemed fine until I noticed all my wheel lug locks were missing. I brought it up but no one would own up to it so they gave me a "free regular oil change" which is just a $14.00 value. New wheel lug locks cost more than double that amount. I even had an air filter go missing after an oil change. This was a result of their free inspection that they preform every time you bring a car in. I had to buy a new air filter (Another out of pocket expense since they didn't own up to that either).

Then came the most recent series of unfortunate events:
I took my car in for a regular oil change. Nothing too difficult (I would do it myself but, I cant find the time). This simple oil change turned into a stained driveway from a new oil leak, a dead battery and a broken hood latch and even having my car towed twice!

To Big-O-Tires' defense, they covered my first tow back to their garage (2 miles between home and them), and even replaced the $0.99cent oil plug gasket. But this small act of "courtesy" as the clerk called it, is really just a way to get me off their back and avoid fixing the real issue.

To add more detail, anytime you bring a car into Big O, they open your hood and do a free battery test, check fluids etc. While they informed me that my battery tested good and it is still relatively new, my car ended up dead the next morning. 

Which leads me to how I found out my car was dead. After getting my oil changed, I noticed a large oil puddle under my car that same night. Unfortunately Big-O was closed so I had to take the next morning off from work so I can take it back in and have them fix their mistake. I called prior and they said to bring it in so, I got in my car and found out it wouldn't start. This was strange considering my battery passed inspection just the day before. So, I decided to open my hood and check out if everything is connected or not.

Well then, nothing, my hood would not open. I pulled the hood latch and nothing happened, no sign of any mechanisms even moving. Perhaps someone slammed my hood too hard and broke the latch? I'll never know. But it is just another issue to add to the list that Bog-O has caused all in less than 24hrs.

After getting a $550.11+ quote for the repairs, and NO REFUND on my oil change (which again they couldn't even preform properly) I am now paying for yet another towing to a new mechanic, who charges less and is more trusted (still all expenses out of my own pocket now), There was no refund, no coupons or vouchers, not even a simple apology was issued. All I received was a new bill, and an interrogation as to whom my new mechanic is, all from the Big-O staff involved.

In addition to all the vehicle issues, the customer service at this location has always been far from professional. Arguing with customers, arguing with me, rude in general, and often arrogant and unhelpful. Not to mention the pushy over priced tire and service sales to the unfortunate customers.

Overall, I should have never came back after the first time parts went missing. Now I'm stuck with a towing bill, no oil refund, a broken hood-latch that wont even open, and a dead battery.  The customer service is again very sub-standard, and unprofessional and definitely lacks any form courtesy.

**AT LEAST READ THIS** 
Moral of the story, TRUST YELP!!! ask around if anyone has ever been there. Yelp's rating of this places doesn't lie. Big-O-Tires on Lindsay and Warner in Gilbert, AZ is to be avoided at all cost. A returning loyal customer has been lost today. A very good and just decision on my part.Our personal experience with this pediatricians office was bittersweet. Prepare yourself, this is gonna be a long review!

I gave birth to our daughter last year in September, and the pediatrician that saw her and checked up on us while we were in the hospital was absolutely amazing, She belonged to this practice, so we just followed her there to continue seeing her.

Unfortunately, this office was not nearly as amazing as our pediatrician. As with all newborn visits, we were going frequently for about five months. We made five visits total, and each visit was a below average experience. The ONLY reason we stuck it out as long as we did was for the pediatrician.

First, the look and feel. The lobby is small, outdated, and very uncomfortable. The majority of the chairs were the little kindergarten desk chairs, and they littered the open space in a messy and unorganized manner. We had to climb over a number of obstacles just to get to an open seat where we felt somewhat comfortable. From the T.V. to the mural on the wall, everything was so old looking. Even the magazines were outdated, by months. I always felt very uncomfortable and out of place, as if I was sitting in a home where I was unwelcome.

Second, the cleanliness. My goodness, this place was not up to par with my expectations of cleanliness for pediatricians. The lobby always had some sort of trash on the few side tables that were available. I could let that go if it weren't for the rooms. The one place I would expect thorough cleanliness is the examination rooms. Every time we waited in the room, I could not WAIT to get my daughter out of there! In our short time there, we saw leftover, half eaten candy, crumpled up paper towels, dried up spills, and even a stray diaper that somehow didn't make it into the trash bin. Gross!

Third, the office staff. On almost every visit, they were rude, unorganized, and quite honestly lazy. They oozed a "I have better things to do" attitude. They never kept the lobby clean, and the movies on the T.V. were almost always stuck on the title menu. They couldn't even pay attention to that! Their lack of attention to detail and their awful attitudes always had me leaving in a bad mood.

Fourth, the waiting. We waited for at least 45 minutes every time, despite being 10-15 minutes early. I understand falling behind in appointments, but waiting this long every single time and seeing patients who came in well after us getting called before we did was not cool. And even once we got in the room, we waited for AT LEAST another 30 minutes before finally seeing our doctor. Just waiting was exhausting in itself, especially with a newborn.

Finally, the straw that broke the camel's back. On my last visit, I literally waited for an hour and a half before finally getting into the back. The only reason I waited so long was because the office staff said my daughter was due for vaccinations, and I had already paid my co-pay. When I finally got a room (which had a lollipop stick stuck to the exam bed) I waited for another half hour before I finally grabbed someone from outside our room in the hallway and asked them how much longer our doctor would be. She had no idea. I told her we were just here for vaccinations. She checked our paperwork and told me that according to our chart, my daughter was not getting shots that day. That was it! I gathered my things, strapped my daughter back in her carseat, and just walked out of our room. As busy as the traffic in the hallway was, no one noticed. I kindly told the front desk that I had been waiting over two hours with no sight of my doctor and I was given a "that's too bad" half-ass apology. I never went back.

While our pediatrician was awesome, she alone did not make up for the awful experiences we had every single time we went in for my daughter's check ups. I originally started this review with two stars, think one star might be too harsh. But after re-living everything and writing it all down, I know that one star definitely describes our experience with this place.Worst walmart ever! Go there late on the way home from work sometimes and now I never will again. It's filthy dirty and the service is horrible. They have pallets all over the place and you can't navigate the isles and the stockers don't help accommodate you they will watch you have to go out of your way to come around the other side to grab stuff. Most humans would say let me move this so you can get by or can I grab u something NOPE. Wait 45 minuets in a long line with one register open. Horrible never returning.I'm of Asian descent born in the states and I am pretty familiar with my Chinese food. Parents were visiting from the Bay Area and we had already visited the Chinese Cultural center, so I thought we could hang closer to home. 

Very cute and clean restaurant. Plate full of fried wonton skins as well as a pourable container of sweet & sour sauce were awaiting at every table. Which made me skeptical as to how long it had been sitting there. Decent prices. Service was fast and friendly.

My parents had the egg drop soup to start. They said the soup was not bad as it had pieces of chicken and water chestnut throughout. Good start. My mother had the teriyaki chicken and my father and I had the shrimp in lobster sauce. Large portions and wafting aromas were very promising. 

I was so hoping that this place would have good Chinese food. It is freeway close, not too many miles from home. Alas, we were very disappointed in the meals. The teriyaki chicken (bummed also that it did not come with any veggies) over rice was drowned in a heavily salted and sugared teri sauce. There was not one iota of white left in the rice. She had 3 pieces and stopped. Granted the chicken was not over done and it was all breast meat. The shrimp with lobster sauce, also drowned, but in a heavily salted lobster sauce. Lots of shrimp, but not very edible on our taste scales.The store had a good selection and the quality seemed to be good, however I had such a bad experience there with the salesman that I had to write a review.

He kept steering us to furniture we didn't want, but seemed to have a large price tag.  Then, when we found a piece, that we liked, he kept pushing accessory furniture like accent tables and ottoman, which we made clear at the outset, we only wanted the sofa and chair.  Finally, he would not let us purchase the pieces we wanted without their fabric warranty.  He was one of the pushiest salesmen I have worked with.  So, if you must buy something from La-Z-Boy and you walk in and get "assigned" Jeff Minter ask for someone else.  Otherwise, you are in for a difficult shopping experience.This place should be called Pick up Sodium.    Everything is over seasoned and high in Sodium.    The Beef and Broccli has 2190 grams of sodium on a 620 calorie dish!    The chicken teriyaki bowl with white rice has 4200 grams.   Samurai Sam's chicken teriyaki bowl, large has 940 grams, while the regular bowl has 520 grams.   Skip this place.Rude employees.  Don't expect much help. Slowest check-outs EVER.As previously noted, wait time is unacceptable, no reason to wait for an hour past app't time except for being inept. I agree with a previous writer, I could see staff through the glass on the door & agree they were standing around (no papers in hand) laughing & chatting.....while I waited.
Also, to agree with another writer, it seems as tho' they "pad" the estimate with services that are exorbitant in cost.
I do not recommend Banfield but if you DO go there review the estimate with a fine tooth comb, most of the service is probably not necessary.This location is the worst around. The baristas were rude and pushy with their products. When I refused to buy their nasty tea or over priced coffee the cashier became overly sarcastic and short with us.

While waiting for our drinks, the baristas loudly bad mouthed a coworker and one even went as far as to talk about cutting the hated girl's hours so they didn't have to work with her as much. Not professional, not impressive, just plain rude and off-putting.

The inside dining area is small, crowded, and disgusting. The girls could spend less time talking trash about their fellow coworkers and more time doing what they're being paid to do. 

The outside dining area is mismatched (not in an attractive way) and is reminiscent of walking through crap at a yard sale. 

I won't be returning here and I won't be recommending this location to anyone.TERRRIBLE customer experience!!!! Limited menu during "Lunch hours", but willing to make execptions.... We were hoping for butter or olive oil for the bread.... we were told we had to wait until she was done wrapping silverware before she would be able to bring it to us.... then she brought one of four meals to the table... we waited over 10 minutes before the waitress showed up to offer more drinks... all we wanted was our food and her EXCUSE was she was busy with other tables.... but no one esle was there, but two other tables that showed up after us already had ALL of their meals! VERY DISAPOINTING!!!!! When she did show up... her tie grazed over all of the one dish that we had for over 10 minutes! GROSS! We will NEVER eat there again! AT ANY loacation!Sweet Tomatoes reminds me of those store purchased cookies from my childhood called Almost Home Cookies. They were almost good but weren't. Sweet Tomatoes is Almost good but also isn't. I tried a variety of things and couldn't find one thing that was good to me except for the service.

I made myself a nice big salad with mostly nice produce but whatever dressings were in the salad mix tasted awful to me so my whole nice almost good salad didn't taste good.

I tried the Thai Cole Slaw and after a bite I was done with that. It was almost good made with nice fresh vegetables but lacked the taste I wanted. 

I tried some sort of pasta salad with turkey and the seasoning just wasn't tasty. It was almost good but wasn't. The pasta was very squishy and turned to mush and the turkey had a strong turkey taste to it so it needed a good flavor to cover that up.

I tried a piece of grilled chicken, it was moist but was over seasoned with some sort of Italian concoction that tasted awful. Too much dry maybe old herbs. Seemed like it could have been good chicken but wasn't.

Tried a little square of pizza. Wow that was bad and not close to almost good. It's kind of like Wonder Bread with tasteless sauce and almost no cheese.

Tried a spoonful of Macaroni and cheese, it was maybe slightly better than the blue box stuff and seemed similar to that with maybe some added real cheese. 

I thought the sweet potato plain might be good. It was a real potato but it was water logged and seemed like it was steamed with lots of water entering the potato making it a watery potato like baby food.

The soft serve was almost good. It tasted watered down but was thick. The metal bowls were nice that kept the ice cream cold.

Maybe the worst thing I tried was the sweet orange cranberry muffin. It wasn't sweet and had raisins in it instead of cranberries. It just was very unappetizing and was very bread like.

Almost good........ but wasn't. 
Sorry to put it that way but that's the way the cookie crumbles.

1.5 starsworst return policy in the world!
even with a receipt! be careful if you do a partial payment with a gift card!!

Experience 1 - I purchased Nip/Tuck season whatever ($40), a sweater ($28) and the Black Eyed Peas cd ($12) online from target.com. I paid mostly with my debit card, but I had used the last $9 of a gift card as well.
I printed the order confirmation everything showed exactly as I ordered it. I get my items and instead of the Black Eyed Peas Cd I get the Nip Tuck soundtrack. I go to return it to the store. I can'y because althought they carry the cd, that portion of the order was fulfilled by amazon.com NOT target.com. So I bought the cd there in store and called target to find out about returning it for a refund and a credit on the shipping. They would only refund the cd to the gift card and no refund on shipping since the nip tuck soundtrack was on the invoice, it must be my mistake even though my order confirmation shows no signs of the nip tuck sndtrk. When I read them their own return policy stating simply that refunds will be credited to the original form of payment and since the cd was priced higher than the value of the gift card the refund should be credited to my debit card. The representative then lead me to a SECOND return policy that was similar but stated that the entire amount would be refunded to the gift card since i used a target gift card for a portion of the payment. Now to get to this second refund, I had to type the URL into the address bar of my browser. The rep was unable to tell me how to navigate to it from their site. There were no links to get to it. It was a static page that required you to type the address in manually. How would I have ever known that??

Experience2 - I purchased some nice metal shower curtain hooks ($16). They kept catching on the shower rod tho as the rod was too thick around. I went to return them. I had no receipt and I paid cash. My fault.  I went to exchange it for a $65 mirror which I was told I cannot do since I didn't have the receipt I could only exchange it for something of equal or greater value (the mirror was greater) and from the same department. IT WAS FROM THE SAME STORE WHO THE FUCK CARES WHAT DEPARTMENT IT WAS FROM??
Oh and I couldn't get store credit I had to use it that same day.Stsy away from.the ruban. Paper thin  corned beef and little of it. Service was fine. Place is a little on the greasy sideJust an FYI the AGM Mark Seligman is terrible. He couldn't care less about the guests who stay at his property. 

He makes it very obvious he uses the "do as I say not as I do" method with his employees as they show more professionalism than he does...how sad. I'm sure he's not in his position due to his exposure to true hospitality positions or has forgotten what its like to leave his office. Seems as though the GM condones his actions also.....im not done exposing him yet.


My hotel stay on the other hand was still good despite this joke of a managerDon't buy any type of ring from this place.  My wife and I were going to renew our vows on Hawaii.  I picked out a really nice 4 carat ring for the wedding.  Or so I thought.  The ring was blessed by the pastor and 3 days later on the plane back one of the smaller diamonds on the ring fell out.  They gave us the exact same ring 2 weeks later.  Today I get a call from my wife telling me a stone fell out of the new ring we got.  We had just gotten this new ring blessed by taking a side trip to Kauai to have it done.  Now I'm out an additional $400.00+ and my wife has a crappy ring to wear.

Go to a jeweler and don't get what you think is a good quality ring from a department store.This location is nothing but problems, every time I go to this store I'm treated bad, and the food is terrible and always burned or raw, when you address the issues with the food they say bring it back, well I told them I've got to goto work they said well bring the chicken and the receipt the next day I said what am I going to do with the food in the mean while she said well you got a fridge right? wow really never again, the manager called me from that store even after I specifically asked the 800 number to have a district manager call she said I can come into the store for a free replacement however i'm not going to because I'm afraid they might do something to the replacement food.I completely hate this place. Being that the Anthem community is so removed from Eastern, it appears that this Vons is very aware of the slight monopoly they have based on their close location.  Every time I go in here I pay way more than I would have paid at Smiths (even with my Vons loyalty card) and on top of that I can NEVER find at least half the things I need. Naturally, I save all my Vons trips for "emergency" cooking situations where I don't have the time to make it down to Smiths and back. Even then I would rather go to CVS than Vons because 1. Vons is expensive, 2. I can never find the stuff I need, and 3. If I do find it, it's located clear over on the opposite end of the store. 

For those interested, this Vons does have a Kosher foods section. However, I couldn't care less because I'm not Jewish and I don't see why the Kosher section is located front and center when you walk in. Seriously, it would be way more convenient as a bread, cheese, milk, eggs, pasta or canned foods aisle. You know, the kinds of foods that most everyone uses most often and might need to walk in and grab in a hurry.AWFUL!!! Service was great.  We left and ordered Chinese to pick up. Nuff said!!!!Been going to Vons for years on Pecos and Windmill in Henderson nv.  the new girl at the deli counter can just give you the meats that are pre cut. 3 weeks in a row I have asked for a pound of something, and even though it is pre cut, she ALWAYS has to cut it fresh. I takes so much time. I don't understand. Plus, she makes people wait while she cleans up.  If she just put things away as she goes then we wouldn't have to wait.  She is a nice girl,  but needs to be more organized. I went in last Friday and when I saw that she was going to help me I almost said never mind I can o to Albertsons.    For example, I asked for 1 pound of ham off the bone. I was all pre cut, but she grabbed the whole ham and sliced it when it was already sliced!!!  Then when I got home I realized it wasn't even Ham off the bone.This is another example of an auto repair shop looking to upsale and be dishonest. I bought a Groupon online for $35 that included oil changes for a year and as soon as the light went on I sent my husband in with our car. The technician told my husband that our 2012 Nissan Altima requires synthetic oil and that the charge would be $106. Good thing they didn't have enough oil in the shop to do the change because when I called the Nissan dealership they said this isn't true, regular oil would work just fine and that they do the change for $30. I will gladly pay Nissan as opposed to a dishonest repair shop. I will NEVER take my car to this place again even though I only live a few blocks away.Raes food and service are awful. I have gone there since 1995 and it's gone downhill. The owner is a very mean and nasty old lady. Food quality and value are poor!!I'm a Colombian living in LA and LV. Wanted to some traditional Colombian food only to be turned away by bad service and little attention. There's only two waitresses for the whole restaurant and one cook. Both to busy to even notice my family and I sitting and waiting. When we called one of them over they rudely told is that it'd be 45 minutes before we could be helped. Left and never coming back. Sad that this is the only Colombian restaurant in town.Horrible experience.   They already added tips in your bill and did not tell u!!

The waiter saw you writing tips on the
 check， but they did not tell u they already charged.  u are like an idiot in their eyes. We paid tips twice! How shame on them!!

Never come again.This the the most expensive Chinese breakfast restaurant. We have 4 people and we spend about $70 dollars. I was shocked when I see the check. We only ordered about 5 small things including milk and Chinese donuts and the Chinese small steam dumplings which they are already dried inside without any juices and so tasteless.This place was a NIGHTMARE! First off, this place was extremely overpriced. A pitcher of beer was $100, give me a break! We put one of our buddies up on stage, and it costed $100. We said ok, and requested blondes and for the DJ to play a certain song. They played a different song, and no blondes on stage. IDIOTS! Then one of my buddies had 2 chicks all over him in the chair and made him pay $40 each. The girls didn't even ask if they could dance on him. The manager came over and was a real D-bag, and made him pay the $80. We explained to him our situation, and he didn't give a rat's a$$ and said W/E. This place sucks balls, and if you wanna lose your money in Vegas, this is the place to go.Old and dry fish and shrimp, the quality of the roll was very poor, amateur. Horrible, the chef was unhappy to be behind the counter. The waitress was horribly rude and short.Thieving bastards! After passing my car the year before, the douche goes through the entire test then tells me the car failed because the vacuum lines "didn't look right."  

That's right, the engine and emissions stuff is completely stock.  It passed on the sniffer,  no check engine light, but he failed me because the vacuum lines "didn't look right"

So instead of telling me before he charged me 20$, he just went on ahead and wasted my time and money.

I literally drove my car around the corner to another company's station, where it passed without a problem. 15 minutes laterOnly if there was a 0/5 stars. 

Food: worst sushi place I've ever been too and I eat a lot of sushi. The sushi at this place taste like plastic and the portions suck. Its like 70% rice and 30% sushi and we all know the crab meat is imitation, so what part of it is even real fish? The only thing that was decent was the bento boxes. The most recent time I went there it was super dead, they had like 1 person there which I think was a groupon person because they were arguing with the customer about what their groupon really meant. Then I saw the waitress taping up a sign about groupon customers right in front of that groupon customer. How rude? Well back to my experience, when you order a bento box you get either a California roll or tuna roll with teriyaki, salad, fried veggies and tempura, and rice. Everything in the bento box was decent expcept the rolls. This sushi chef during lunch hours must've been new people my rolls weren't even rolls they were falling apart! and super small portions. 

Service: The waitress lady was kind of rude to the groupon customer and when it came to me she seemed to totally ignore my table. She never came to refill my drink or ever came to ask if I was doing okay. I had a hard time flagging her down to get my check I literally had to get up and walk to the counter and ask for my check. 

People there are better AYCE and Bento boxes at other sushi places. 

DON'T GO TO THIS ONE.The worst of the worst, did not keep their booking prepaid for a stretch limo.

Terrible customer service by management as they never call you back when a problem arises.

Ruined our wedding.I've been to many chinese restaurants, and this was by far not the best experience I've had.  Poor service.  The prices are higher than other chinese restaurants.  Their egg flower soup had no flavor.  The shrimp with lobster sauce tasted like watered down egg drop soup and had no flavor.  There are many other chinese restaurants who serve way better quality food with a lower price.  You will not see me back here again.First time there chicken for both me and my wife was dry... Sides were fruit salad and limp cucumber salad could have made it better at home for less.

Second time back we gave it a second chance this did not happen however, we waited behind some happy people trying to figure out what to order for over 10 minutes while the line behind us backed up.

We finally had our chance to order after noticing 2  people coming up asking where there lunches were.

We took our table it was me, my wife and my 2 year old son...my son feel through the seat down to the floor while I in shock I quickly pulled him out while he began to cry turned to the front counter girl and demanded a full refund ($28 ) and left, I will never be back. They let people sit in broken seats? I doubt there chicken has improved they could improve there service by making the sides ALL buffet style as they are CHEAPLY MADE anyway.Meh, I've had better. The Mac & Cheese was good though. Average.Wtf. Only giving a 1 star rating because they changed the chicken enchilada soup. Who's the jackass who decided to change the soup. Steward fire him or her please. This bar was sooooo busy u had to fight to get to the bar what happened??? How much money ru you losing now? It's scary to think about it? Maybe It's about time to make a change. As business owner what the fuck are you thinking?For over 30 years I've been walking by this place and never tried it. Last night I decided to pick up a pasty for breakfast. Their website claims they open at 7AM on Fridays. I show up at 7:05 and the store is closed. Hours on yelp disagree with the website and claim they open at 7:30. I go to the office and head back at 7:40, still closed.  I guess I'll continue to walk by this place in the future.Today I received an arrangement that a friend had sent via FTD. I was disappointed with the arrangement that I received. When I called to complain, both of the women that I spoke to were anything but professional. I have used other florists including Felly, Kleins and George's. never had this kind of service. I will not use Choles  or recommend them to anyone. Poor customer service and satisfaction!I would never recommend Barrow. 

My boyfriend was diagnosed with MS about 3 years ago. Barrow Neurological Institute has been a joke to deal with since his first appointment back in February 2011. I am so utterly disappointed with their customer service, bedside manner, doctor turnover, and office operations that I literally have no words to describe how bad it is. Their MS Center needs to clean house and their good reputation is no longer applicable. I would suggest Mayo Clinic or finding literally any other option. I am honestly disgusted by the carelessness he has encountered. They are lucky he is their patient, because I don't have nearly as much patience. I hope someone working for Barrow reads this and takes note. I hope this saves future MS patients from wasting their time. I hope Barrow Neurological Institute realizes a good reputation only goes so far if you do nothing to uphold it. 

If you are researching places to seek ongoing care for MS and would like to know specifics about why I would not recommend Barrow, just PM me. I will back up this one star rating and maybe we can even help each other find better care for ourselves and our loved ones. 

Thanks for nothing, Barrow.We contracted last year with Shasta for a pool spa combo.  What a mistake!  It took 8 months from contact to finish, almost every phase of the pool construction was messed up:  deck cement installed to incorrect measurements, we had  3 trips to store for reselecting the tile types over and over due to supplier outages??? Interior pool finish messy, got white finish up 1 inch of dark grey tile grout and didn't get cleaned up very well!  Tile installed incorrectly in spa, had to be ripped off and reinstalled, new electrical lines shorting out, blew up our existing electrical breaker box on our house and had to replace the box on the house (yes seriously), we had valve issues on the pump for a month, spa draining without a reason, finally found out there was a LEAK in the bottom of the pool! Had to drain spa and patch!  8 months of hassle, zero oversight of their subs/workers and less than zero communication or note taking between employees of Shasta, subs and us the customers.   We had to drain the pool twice for fixes and all we got was 1 check for 50 bucks for all our troubles.  Shasta did fix everything but what a friken a nightmare!  Buyer beware!Gee, I guess Our experience is a weeeee bit different than all these others!  Amazing that customer service didn't happen for us over a RETAIL $13 dollar item so bad service over a probable $3 wholesale ring.  NOT GOOD.  Really not good!

 I was here a couple weeks ago with my friend Joan and her daughter Sarah.  We dropped in on a whim, as we were in the neighborhood and Sarah wanted to see if there might be a hoop there she liked for her nostril piercing.

Steph and J.D. were working that day.  Steph was the primary person that waited on Joan and Sarah.  Steph brought out a silver hoop, saying something like, "This should work."  Sarah liked the looks of it, and Steph asked Sarah if she would like her to install it.  Sarah said yes, and Steph said she needed to see her ID, because Sarah is a minor.

Since we had no original plan to shop for a nose ring when we launched out that day, Sarah did not bring her ID.  Steph said Sarah could likely install it fine at home on her own, and to come back if she had any trouble.

Steph never took a look at Sarah's piercing or asked the size of her gauge.  Joan told Steph twice that Sarah did not get her nose pierced here, but somewhere else.  

As it turns out, because Steph did not look at Sarah's nose or ask the size of her piercing, Steph chose a hoop with a gauge too small for Sarah's nose. So when Sarah got home and tried to put the ring it, it made her nose bleed.

Joan immediately called HTC, and J.D. answered the phone and the conversation went like this:

Joan - "Hi J.D., my daughter and I were just there buying a nose ring. We came home to put it in and the gauge is too large and made Sarah's nose bleed. It must be the wrong size, and I need to return it."

J.D. - "Oh, I'm sorry. We can't take returns, but I can give you store credit. Isn't her piercing an 18?

Joan - "No, it's a 20."

J.D. - "We only do 18's on nostrils here."

Joan - "I told you guys twice that we didn't get her nose pierced at HTC.  We got it pierced at Halo.  I had no idea that different places did different size standard piercings for nostrils. And no one at your store last night asked Sarah about the size of her piercing after we told you that we got her nose pierced somewhere else."

J.D. - "I'm very sorry about that. Like I said, we can't take returns, but I can give you store credit.

Joan - "That's fine. See you tomorrow."

When Joan went to exchange the nose ring the following day, neither Steph nor J.D. were working.  A dreadful person named Richard was there.  Richard told Joan that J.D. had no business saying that HTC would give her store credit, because once a piece of jewelry leaves the store, HTC will not take it back as a return or even for store credit.

Richard then asked if Steph examined Sarah nose or asked about her gauge size.  Joan explained the whole story about how none of that occurred despite the fact that Joan told the staff twice that Sarah did not get her nose pierced at HTC.

Richard suggested, "Why don't you come back again when Steph and J.D. are working, and maybe one of them will give you the money out of their own pocket because this was their mistake and there's no way HTC can reimburse you."  Joan could not believe her ears, and was she not about to make a THIRD trip back to the store for what would likely be another futile, frustrating encounter!

So, Joan and Sarah were out the money for a worthless piece of jewelry. This is about one of the worst customer service stories I've ever witnessed.  

The story does have somewhat of a happy ending, in that Joan got her money back through her credit card company when she called and told them the story.  They couldn't believe their ears either and refunded her immediately.

Moral of the story:  Businesses, is a really unhappy, connected customer really worth bad press over a $13 retail order?Unless it's dishonest and uneducated salespeople and sticky counters you're looking for, go someplace else. Their staff is all slimy used car salespeople-in-training.

If someone's helpful, it's because they're getting commission. And take a close look at that slip you take to the register -- they're known for secretly sneaking in additional items or the next-level-up product.

Here's some things I've experienced: 

-Man in memory section told me I couldn't grab an OEM box of Windows 7 from the shelf (just a few aisles away) and had to include it on his commission slip --sneaky
-Man in home a/v had never heard of Roku Player.  --uninformed/uneducated salespeople
-Man in Apple section (where they have the new Apple TV) excused the fact that they're not demoing one with "Yeah, Apple doesn't let us set them up." --tackyI used to go to this location at least 3 times a week...then one day...the soup tasted like the smell of the bathroom...

I stopped going for a long time then a co-worker wanted to go there....ok, let's give it a try, I thought.

I'm not going to get this place into too much trouble saying what I really want to say...but the health inspectors need to visit...ick.  (it involves lots of bugs that can survive a nuclear explosion)

I can't believe this place has almost 5 stars. Crazy.I ordered for a few co-workers and I. First time and sadly enough last time.
Very bland, I can't even finish my dish. Also the bag I had my boxes in had all the sauces mixed together and openend and the boxes weren't clsoed fully.
I ordered for 4 people and none of them liked their food. Would think it could be just me, bit obviously not. Eeeww.I just put a review in here for this place and now I need to add an update. Do not go here, they are unprofessional and rude. I called them today around noon to find out when they close being Christmas eve. I was told 4pm so I planned to be there around 3:30 to pick up some gyro sandwiches for myself and my mother. I arrived at 20 minutes till and parked in front. When I stepped out of the car the owner stepped out and said they were closed. This to me is not the way to run a business. I said it was not 4pm yet and he didn't say much then just walked back in the store. Damn rude if you ask me. Puts me off from going back to
this place and I will not recommend it to anyone. Makes me wonder if the lost business was worth going home 20 minutes early.

"Update" I went in to King Gyros a few days ago mostly because my mother loves the meat here. Right when I walked in The owner in the back started yelling at the women behind the counter. I was thinking he must read yelp and realized I was the one who gave him a bad review. Turns out he was telling the woman to give me a free gyro because they were closed when I arrived on Christmas eve. He told me he remembered me and apologized for being closed. I would say they redeemed themselves in spades. I now will recommend them and go back.crappy food terrible service! the food sucked and the waiter was rude! dont go here unless you like to waste your money and hang out at a loud place! expensive food thats not worth it! ripp off they tried to sit me and my family in a 2 seat chair and we had 4 people! i had to ask 2 times for a booth and they were like trying to push the chairs on me! wth anWhat a RIPOFF! My husband has psoariasis and we came here to get his cream. They had to order it and it cost us $30. Way overpriced. We have since realized that we can get the same cream at our local Fry's Pharmacy for only $4 AND they always have it in stock.Unclean environment.  We brought our dog in for grooming with specific instructions on how we wanted her groomed the first time they followed our request the next time we barely recognized her she was shaved almost to the skin.....never again will we use Smoochie Poochie....they have phantom charges on our bill for  the natural gas for the grills and they charges us for refilling the pool after they had it emptied, take forever on fixing things. now after i went in in december to put my notice in not sure when we were going to have a house they said don't worry you only have to give 30 days notice.. lie! they are going to charge us a full extra month 1500 for not giving proper notice.Visiting from out of town and went to the breakfast club. Worst breakfast experience ever. Your experience in a restaurant starts from the time you are greeted and usually sets the tone of everything to follow. We sat at the counter and the black girl working it looked at us like  she wanted to know what the hell we were doing there and what do we want. If she attempted even the slightest smile it woulda cracked that pretty smooth face for sure. Why do they hire people to work with the public that have absolutely NO PEOPLE SKILLS. Ok, on to the SECOND impression. The coffee. Its horrible. Luke warm light brown dirty water. They should be ashamed they're selling it. LASTLY, the food. It was ok but served to the table almost immediately after it was ordered, cold. 3 strikes Breakfast Club, yeeeeeeer OUT!!!I confirmed with restaurant.com that the voucher was valid and that the owner acted in an inappropriate manner.  AVOID PITA HOUSE.I can't believe I have to give a star to this place in order to provide a review.

Had the worst restaurant experience, EVER, at this establishment.  The food was a nightmarish mess.  It was so bad it was hysterical!  Service was absolutely 3rd world!  The nerdy waitress had the nerve to overcharge our table $40.  The manager stumbled out bellowing, "What's your problem now?!" 

"FIRST OF ALL, we aren't pleased with the food and the waitress overcharged us." I retorted.

"Well get out, we're closing in 20minutes anyway!" he snickered.

Long story short --- this place is an overrated outhouse.I will skip this place next time I am in the area.  Staff?  Don't get me started!  Everything, including the food is overrated.This is by far the worst experience I've ever had with any company in my life. I made a reservation for a 17' truck weeks in advance for my move from Phoenix to California. I received an order confirmation from Uhaul that confirmed a 17' truck would be available for pickup from the location at UHaul of Scottsdale (3033 N Scottsdale road). I also used the uhual website to schedule loading and unloading service. Upon arriving on 6/30 to pickup my truck, I was informed that they could not give me a 17' truck. They had sent the truck out with someone else. They also could not give me a 19' truck. Their only option was to give me a massive 26' big rig which I was not comfortable driving across the state. After yelling at them, they finally were able to locate a 19' truck way up in north Scottsdale. Since I was pressed for time (moving is pretty damn stressful), I accepted but only because I had no other option. To add insult to injury, I was charged $60.00 more for the larger truck AND I lost 2 hours on my moving day do to the mixup and extra time it took to travel up to North Scottsdale to pickup the other truck. As a result, I lost an hour of scheduled moving time with the loading service I had scheduled. Unless the store reimburses me for the extra charges I incurred and the hour of time I lost with the pre-paid moving service, I plan to raise hell with UHaul corporate. I had a reservation for a 17' truck. They had my credit card on file. There is no excuse that the truck was not there. I trusted what I thought was a reputable company to help me with a big move and they failed miserably.This was one of my most awful experiences at a craft store of any kind. Quite honestly, I found the staff to be rude and the selection to be sparse and over priced. Just because you live in Scottsdale doesnt mean you are required to fit the stereotype. There are other great bead stores in the area. I will NEVER go back to Scottsdale Bead Supply. 

When I got there, I expected to see row upon row of a beautiful selection, seeing as on their website, this is how it looked. I walked in to the awkwardly dark store and got a glare from on of the women working there who took on look at me and said, "Purse in the locker. Take the key." with an arrogance I have never been subjected to in my many years of creating jewelry. 

Terrible. Absolutely terrible.The only saving grace of the awful restaurant was the guacamole . As I entered the restaurant entrance there was a pack rat full of smokers blocking the way in. Only to find out its the employees bitching about the customers inside . We were greeted by an Unfriendly senior Latina waitress not bothering to look our way, as if she was too tired to deal with another tourist as it was getting late 7pm  . Our food is at the table in less than three min  tamales with chile relllenos it was buried in a thick gloppy green  sauces that look and tasted like to much cornstarch was added . it look as if some one threw up on the plate just terrible ,a bland texture and taste along with a mushy non forgiving tamale . This place lacks so much . It need a complete head to toe makeover from decor to. Food  and honestly they  need to get rid of the front staff even if is is family a lazy group of unfriendly zombies    . I hardly call this Mexican as this place seems to of given up a long time ago  . Shame on my hotel  to suggest this  Pit hole I will be speaking to them . Now I wait in my room to start felling the effect of this abortion of food and what it is going to do to my stomach . 
   .Incredibly rude and impatient.

After seeing the banner outside, I came in and asked if the "Hollywood Collection" was in a rotation of shows and before I could get another word out, I was told that they are a gallery and everything is for sale. Ummm ok. 

I said "I'm asking because the sign said 'collection' and I was curious if other collections will rotate in during the year?" He says, "It's right there."
Umm...

He then harshly told me that photos are not allowed and no cameras, either. Ooo kkkk, I know that's how it works, but did I look like I was going to do that?

We visit the area a lot and my question is not unusual...regardless, I would never patronize a gallery that hires such an aggressive social misfit.

The Hollywood Collection in question was tired and, even though I only spent a minute there, the rest of the gallery looked pretty boring. And not picture worthy, you jerk.I paid $200 dollars to have an emerald set in a ring here. When I picked up the ring, the stone was off center by over a millimeter. When I asked the jeweler to please center the stone, his reply was "oh yeah, I noticed it was off center and thought that was weird." So he reset the stone, this time or was center, however when I got home I noticed that the emerald was not securely fastened and that it was actually slightly moving around in the prongs. Upon further examination I realized he did not file down the prongs, something that will lead to hair and clothing snagging on the prongs constantly. 

Terrible service and craftsmanship and unreasonable prices.PRO - close to camelback mountain
CONS - Dirty, Bugs, no attention to detail

Read good reviews, so decided to spend a weekend here.

Upon arriving, we were quickly greeted by the valet, and he helped us to our room.  The valet eagerly grabbed the bags out of our car and tossed them into his golf cart.  Unfortunately, my girlfriend's diamond earrings were in a bag that was not closed up well and were lost.

When we got to the room, we opened the door and were greeted by a large cockroach.  The valet seemed embarrassed about the large bug and tried to catch it for 10 or 15 minutes.  After unsuccessfully catching the roach, he called the front desk to see if we could get another room.  The front desk said there were no rooms so I personally had to find and kill the bug myself.  My girlfriend and I were not thrilled about having to sleep here but without any choice we stayed.

I tried to put on the television, and after 10 minutes of messing with the various remotes we had in the room I discovered that the TV was not connected to anything or even plugged in.  We called the front desk and within about 20 minutes someone came up to fix it. 

In the morning we woke up and found spider webs around the curtains.  There was a small patio with a table.  We were unable to enjoy them since the patios was very dirty and table/chairs were coveed in spiderwebs.  We found numerous insects in the room and bathroom.

Room is kind of old, nothing special about it.  Infinity pool is kind of small. Bathroom is very narrow. You can stay somewhere else for a cheaper price.  It is not worth to splurge over $600 per night to stay here.

I wend to the front desk to talk to the manager, but was tole that the manager was out.  I left my number for them to call me but have not heard from them yet.  (It's been over a week)

We ended up checking out and will never return. $600+ for a single night, did not get to enjoy anything I read about in other reviews.Stay away from Rancho Cockroachietta, My wife and lived here for a yr, and made repeated request for building to be fumigated because of cockroach problems, and bed bugs. Only to told by management that complex doesn't have a roach problem. WRONG WRONG WRONG, My wife is bitten nightly by bed bugs, and I have woken up with cockroaches crawling across my arm. Their own pest control person even admits that is a problem, but still they won't do anything about it. Now because of this problem we are being evicted because of it, and have to throw out a California King bed that cost 1500 because of the bedbugs.

Also the first night we were there, someone asshole vandalized my wife's brand new car, and when I reported to the management, all they could say is we aren't responsible for damaged property. I can guarantee that if there property was damaged those losers would going after the person who did it.Went to cafe boa the evening of March 3rd, 2012. Our waiter was exceptionally nice. However we waited almost 45 mins to get our food. That is when we got to meet the manager.  The manager was totally unprofessional. He was dressed like he belonged in a tattoo parlor with his plaid shirt w/ rolled up sleeves to reveal his super trendy forearm tattoos. And he had a punk attitude to match. He told us that our food was late due to theatre rush. When we questioned him on this (since the theatre crowd had left 1/2 hour prior) he made some weird gestures and gave us more attitude and said "would you rather me stand here and lie to you, or be honest" we said "we just want our food, not excuses". At that point, he made more weird gestures and abruptly excused himself. Nice waiter returned and said "I heard that that did not go well" (we must have been the talk of the kitchen). At this point we expressed our frustration and exited the restaurant. We were able to pickup Olive Garden to go in Mesa (very good restaurant, great alternative to Cafe Boa) for a much more reasonable price.

I have been a resident of Az for 14 years and have been to cafe boa many times in the past. But I will never go back to the one in Tempe as long as that manager is there.They messed up my bacon egg cheese bagel and gave me a sausage egg and cheese bagel. They flipped the cooked egg in the plastic container on to the plastic table the place where all the other food Is prepared. That added a Some new taste.I've been to Rosati's plenty of times before (never this location), any my experience has never been this bad.  I called in a carry out order at 4:30 pm (This is well before the dinner rush).  The girl taking the call doesn't take my name and unceremoniously hangs up on me after saying the pizza would be ready in 20 minutes.  I show up at 4:55pm, and say to the girl at the counter " I am here to pick up a carry out order".  She asks my name and I tell her the girl on the phone didn't ask my name.  She responds, "oh yeah, I didn't".  She checks on my pizza and tells me it going to be another 5 minutes.  Fine, I pay and sit down on the bench out front.  I can over hear what sounds like 5 - 6 teenagers talking loud about energy drinks and their work schedules.  By the way they were cursing I imagine they either forgot I was up front or do not care.  The girl at the counter came back at 5:05 to tell me my pizza is almost out and it shouldn't be more than 5 minutes.  She then leaves to go to Albertsons.  I am not high school math teacher but I know it takes longer than 5 minutes to walk to Albertsons, pick out your energy drinks, pay for them, then walk back to Rosatis.  But all of that happened before my pizza came out.  5:15 pm my pizza is ready.  That's 45 minutes on a slow night.  I've worked in pizza places before and know it doesn't take that long to cook a pizza.  All would have been forgiven had the pizza actually been cooked.   When I got home the family sat down and to eat and were surprised by crunchy (uncooked) onions, and extremely under cooked dough.  I'm wondering why I game them $28 for one of my worst pizza experiences ever.  

Let me restate this, we normally LOVE Rosati's pizza, but this is our first time visiting this location.  It will also be our last.  I'd much rather pay half that price and get a better product from Barro's across the street.  Maybe the Roasti's in Chandler will be better...TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE x2!!!!

Called up this auto shop to get a check engine light Diagnosed. Upon talking to Rockie, he told me they would do it for free but if it took longer than an hour he would have to charge me the Diagnostics fee, which is absolutely understandable, but when they found the problem if I chose to get the work done there they would waive that fee. Sounded reasonable so I scheduled an appointment.

Upon a few days later when getting there for my appointment, I was greeted at the counter by Doug. Told him what I was there for and gave him the keys to my car. Now mind you I like to pay attention to people while they work on my car, and man I tell you its a good thing I did.

When they took my car into the bays, I noticed the mechanic taking the tires off, I called Doug over and asked what he was doing. He stated just rotating the tires, it was "included" and I figured whats the harm might as well let him. A few minutes later  went back to check on my car only to find the mechanic draining the oil. (Mind you I NEVER once asked for an oil change, as a matter of fact the previous week I had just changed the oil myself and use Mobil 1 Synthetic, which is not cheap). Again I call Doug over and ask him what the heck is going on, he tells me "Your here for an oil change right?' I tell him no and explain to him what I was there for, at this point what they should have already known, so Doug runs outside to stop the mechanic, only to find that all the oil was drained out. Luckily he replaced the drained oil with Mobil 1 at no charge.

So after all of that I sit there for another 30 minutes while no one at all is working at my car at this point (its just sitting there) to have Doug come out and tell me that with  that check engine light he "Google'd" it and it could be a number of things. GOOGLE'D!!!!!!! are you kidding me?!?!?!?!?! If I wanted something Google'd I could have done that myself. He then tells me he would have to charge me that Diag fee. (Mind you that I am only supposed to be charged a Diag fee if it takes more than one hour per Rockie who I previously spoke with, but at this point no one has worked on the issue of my car at ALL!!!)

Then to top it all off, Doug tells me that they dont have time to work on my car today and to come back tomorrow. WHAT WAS THE POINT OF SCHEDULING AN APPOINTMENT!!!!!!!!!!!!! Then while driving off they left a mess in my car which included the paper floor mats as well as their work order for me and even the plastic red bordered sheet holder that they use!

Needless to say I let some time pass and do some research myself on the issue and find that all I may need is a simple computer process run on my car which literally takes 2-3 min in full (Crankshaft Variation Learn). So I call these guys back up and at first no one knows what the heck I'm talking about, even though they seem to love Google which is exactly where I found this procedure. I ask the Tech on the phone how much would you charge to do this, he asks me what kind of car it is and then says just come on over we will do it no charge. So I drive over there and talk to the people at the desk and they again have no idea what I'm talking about, so yet again they rely on there magical computer to tell them. After waiting, the person who I spoke with that told me it was going to be at no charge on the phone comes out and tells me, "were going to have to charge you labor". I stated well someone I just talked to said it was free of charge, he then said "yeah that was me but I just thought you wanted your check engine light codes cleared". NOT ONCE DID I MENTION ANYTHING ABOUT CHECK ENGINE LIGHTS NOR CLEARING CODES WHEN I TALK TO THIS MAN RIGHT BEFORE GOING OVER THE SECOND TIME. I told him to forget it and then left, found Litchfield Auto Repair who was more than happy to do it for me.

This shop is poorly run, no one talk to each other, they dont know what they are doing, they tell you one thing than do another,and seems like they will charge you for anything after they have you in the door. I WILL NEVER RETURN TO THIS SHOP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!A little bit of attitude at this place bad attitude,
Was not really sure how how many stats I wanted to give, I'll check back next time give another chance I walked in to have maybe one slice of pizza got a little bit of attitude and no pizza, So I walked back out without saying a word because I wasn't not in the mood for this, So maybe I won't come, But really I would not have no reason to  come back in there, Are so many better places without
 the attitude a bad  attitude. "Really you guys get a new Attitude"The doctor there doesn't have customer service skills or understand how to talk with patients. I went there for an exam and he had me look through two lenses, never asked me how I could see the letter, after the 15 seconds of the two lenses he told me my prescription was going to stay the same. Never looked into whether my vision has gotten any better or worse and didn't take the time to seem to care. I did complain to the manager Rachel who was wonderful in understanding and didn't charge me for the visit.
I did make it clear I would not return to their vision centers with doctors of that knowledge. I have used them for two years previous and will no longer go there.If getting the work done is as difficult as getting an estimate, I wouldn't let the company do work for me. I had called and set an appointment time, which is like an appoint with the cable company (2-5pm). I needed it to be later in the afternoon so my husband could be home to discuss our ideas and the different fencing. 

The day of the appointment, the service man called at 1130 saying he was done with his other jobs early and could he come over early. When I told him no and explained why, he said he would call the office to see if they could send someone else out. 2 o'clock rolls around and no call to say whether or not they would be sending someone out. So I called the office. I was told that they would be unable to send anyone else out today and didn't have any other late afternoon or saturday appointments this week or next. So what good did it do me to set the original appointment and why do I have to call them to find out that no one would be coming out on the day that THEY said they would? 

I'm sure their work is fine and may even be great, but I am certainly not impressed with this first impression of the company. Good luck!The lady who works here is rude, rude, rude. 
I've been here twice and she doesn't acknowledge you when you walk through the door. Majority of the time when I pass by, there's always a giant pile of clothes on the counter. I don't know how or if they stay organized. Today, she scoffed at my husband for giving her a $20 bill. Seriously, with the attitude?! 
I've been a little weary about this place because it looks like a dump from the outside, but the lousy customer service has ensured I won't return.Screw this place.. Dirty crooks.. I stayed at the El Cortez March 21-23. Upon check-in on Friday I paid my bill for the 2 nights, I was informed and VERY aware of how a deposit works when you check into a hotel. I was told by the hotel clerk this was a HOLD ONLY on my card and that the charge would fall of my cc a couple of days after I've  checked out. Well, wouldn't you know 4 days later my credit card was charged for the two nights AND the $80.00 hotel deposit. I have placed numerous calls to inquire on why i was charged a hotel deposit AFTER I have checked out of the hotel. Of course I keep  getting the run around from a bunch of morons!! I'm sorry, i know it is only $80.00 bucks, BUT it is MY $80.00 bucks. When I placed the first call to inquire about the over charges I was told the money would get refunded in 7 business days. Well,  Almost 12 business days later and I can not get anybody in management to call me back!! Beware of over charges!!Bf and I had spent the day downtown and were getting hungry. We saw the signs for Tony Romas $11.99 steak & lobster special so we decided to go there. Unfortunately the special is only after 9pm and it was only 6.. Damn. Okay so what specials do you have that are available now? Our server told us about the $8.99 prime rib with veggies and baked potato. The bf went with that and I chose the St. Louis Ribs sampler. Our food came out in 5 minutes. The prime rib was nothing special it was small and bland, the veggies were from a can and the potato was a potato. The ribs were very tender but the sauces all tasted the same. Fries were warm. Everything was just warm like it was already made and sitting under heat lamps. I swear we were in and out of there in 20minutes fastest meal ever! Will not return. Probably won't ever go to another Tony Romas again.I LOATHE this place. The staff acts as if they are doing YOU a favor if they bother to look in your direction and the prices are stupid. I would rather go to a freakin' Savers or try my luck at the very friendly Buffalo Exchange than deal with this place and their oh so hip attitude.

YOU ARE IN DOWNTOWN LAS VEGAS YOU %#$@&!

I try and buy as much Downtown as possible so I know my stuff. Suggestion? Shop at Retro-Vegas, The Charleston Antique Mall or the Salvation Army on Charleston and Valley View. Just avoid this place like the plague.I expected to be dissappointed with the mani/pedi because spas rarely give you your money's worth for this service but I needed it so I went to Mandara at Paris. I was more than dissapointed. This was easily the WORST mani/pedi I've ever had - from the exfolitation so vigorous my feet hurt to the "massage" better described as a lotion application to the polish that turned white (white?) within a day. I was also the beneficiary of sales pitches for every possible manicure product sold at Mandara. Once again I have learned my lesson, DO NOT go to a spa for manicures or pedicures.Seriously anyone who wrote a good review for this place must either work there or has a relative that does.  I've tried this place 3 times now and it's nasty.  Today I tried it again because I read the reviews and thought maybe I was mistaken and my daughter and I waited an hour for nasty pizza (however the bread they served beforehand was good) and our waitress was AWFUL!!!  We went to the one on Horizon Ridge.  Really, people need to start telling the truth about this place, I'm shocked at the reviews.One BIG Problem *** tried to make a reservation for 24 - Christine the lady taken the reservation was told by the manager "Gilmar" that I needed to go on line to secure the reservation. Which I really did not understand why the restaurant could not take the reservation while we were on the phone - like any other restaurant would? I asked to speak to the manager "Gilmar" - I explained how I have been coming their for years and that I trusted them enough to charge my credit card 1000. And if the group was more then 20 minutes late to keep the money. "Gilmar" said he would not do that - he said for groups more then 12 need to make the reservation on line only. I asked what did Nora & Gino do 20 yrs ago when there was no Internet for groups larger then 12. I then asked to make two reservation of 12 - Gilmar told me he could not take that reservation.  If I was Nora - I would have a talk with Gilmar and correct the nonsense. Took the group to Battista's Hole in the Wall - Nora's 10 grandchildren would of enjoyed the extra 1800 bucks in there inherits.........what a shame.Dined here last week with my wife and another couple and did not have a good experience.  Great view but they seated us at a table too small for 4 people and away from the windows.  I brought a nice bottle of wine to share with the group and was surprised at the $50 corkage fee until I saw the overpriced wine list.  Few items under $200 in the red wine category.  My friend and I ordered the venison and it was overcooked and served with a tasteless sauce.  My wife had Roast Duck (a classic French dish) and it was served in a sweet, non-french style sauce.  We all ordered Grand Monier souffles and they were also dull in flavor.  With so many great restaurants in town, you can do better than this place.We just went for lobster feast 2 days ago... the service well our waiter was horrible she rarely came over and when she did she forgot what we asked for... she brought out soup and salad at the same time... we didnt get our drinks until our entrée came out. 3 tables around us had issues... they would receive their entrée before their appetizers! ! It was a mess! The time before last we went we had a horrible waitress too! I dont know who does the hiring there but that person needs to be fired!I like staying in hotels without casinos - no smoke in the lobby and the lines move fast when checking in. Upon check in, I was handed off to the concierge who wanted to sell me something. I found him both prying and annoying.

The room I checked into was spacious - a bit dated and drab, but functional. The next morning around 5:30 AM, the garbage being dumped outside my room woke me because the windows were shaking. When I went downstairs several hours later they promised me that was once a week. They lied.

The next night when my toilet overflowed, the housekeeping operator sounded like she'd heard this complaint a hundred times. It took 6 different staff members to fix the issue. I ended up demanding another room because of how they handled it. Very unsanitary.

The old room and the new room had a difficult time keeping the temperature comfortable. Either the AC overworked or it got hot and stuffy.

Oh, there's never a cab at the place so you have to walk a long block or two to a real hotel to get a cab. The sundry has no alcohol, there's no bar or restaurant in the facility.

When I checked out, I stored my bags. Upon my return I couldn't get anyone to help get them - making it a close shave at the airport. 

I would never stay here again. They could offer me a free room and I don't think I would take it. Maybe they rolled snake eyes on me, but I have stayed in many Vegas hotels and none have been this disappointing. Never again.worst hotel on the strip...well, take that back...2nd worst (Circus Circus Oh My!).  completely in need of renovation inside and out.  my friend said the hotel room was so bad that they should pay you to stay there.  yeah.  the interior is one big labyrinth, and an ugly one at that!  i remember puke-y yellows and golds and whites and dirtiness everywhere.  ugh.  i know its cheap to stay here, but under no circumstances should you do so.I stayed in the manors for 2 nights.  It was the worst Vegas experience ever.  Might as well have stayed at the Travelodge right next door...because they look,  feel and sound like a 3rd class motel.

This "hotel" seems like it hasn't been updated since it was built in 1968.  I got a callous on my thumb from pushing the awful toilet flusher button.  The blankets were covered in suspicious-looking hairs.  There was a brown stain I could only hope was chocolate.

It's at the butt-end of the strip, you have to walk through the main Circus Circus hotel, then past 2 empty lots facing some "fancy" shops such as 7-11, Ross and McDonald's.  By the time we walked to the Venetian, we were so exhausted we turned back without even gambling.WOW..........all I can say is that the reviews for this restaurant under its original name Inka Chicken were so bad they change the name & took down the worst of the reviews. Bad, Bad, Bad, stay away unless you know the new owner personally, only then you might get good service & not get ignored. Don't be fooled Che Inka is the same place.When you go, you sign up, wait a really long time, get a 4 minute safety video, get geared up.   Then you go in with small groups of 4-5 people.  Just like everyone says, in your 1 hour session you get maybe 3-4 minutes of actual air time.  Its pretty fun but...not much time.  Most (98%) of that time the instructor is holding on to you.  

Wife listed this as one of her top 3 events while in Vegas (and we did a lot).  As for me...I had fun but thought it was way not worth it for the little air time you get.

A suggestion for the shop:  get a reservation system so we don't waste all our time waiting around.   

Hint, don't go here unless you get a $10 off coupon in just about any vegas booklet.I'm really not one to give crappy reviews.  If you check my yelp ratings, you'll see that I usually only review things that i LOVE or HATE.  

Battista's Hole in the Wall...i HATE this restaurant.  It's SOO over-priced -- yes you get free wine, but it tastes like vinegar; yes you get a "set" menu, but it sucks.  everything just  tasted SOOO bad.  I can't believe the waiters don't feel bad serving you this food.  

Also, that little accordion man...he's sooo creepy.  shamelessly panders by playing a BAD song to get a tip at your table.  
 
BEWARE.  DON'T GET TRICKED BY THE 4 STAR REVIEWS LIKE I DID.  DO NOT COME HERE.Sorry, sorry, sorry. 

I am sorry I wasted my time! money! and the calories that I took in from this place.  Worst BBQ I have EVER had.This sucks. Got there for the 2 for 1 happy hour. 19.00 for 2 drinks and a receipt for 2 free drinks later. It's a dump and a ripoff even without a cover. Avoid.1 star is an overstatement. I wish yelp had 0 stars because that's all this place deserves. this place is far from being a resort. It looks like an old apartment complex with weird rooms. the first room we were in had a broken sofa bed, the next room had the loudest AC ever. The next one looked ok but when we took a shower, the drain was clogged. Ugh!!! in the midst of the numerous room changes, the girl in the front desk had the nerve to tell us that they should charge us for the 3rd person in the room when we specifically told them there were 3 of us during check-in. The only good thing is that some of staff (the housekeeping and the front desk manager) were apologetic for the inconvenience. please, stay away from this hotel/motel. if you are inclined to stay here because of the price, i recommend staying downtown, like the golden nugget, where it's a couple dollars more but at least it's a hotel.By far one of the worst hotels I have ever stayed at.*********DO NOT STAY HERE. *****Quality and service are now  a ZERO. NOT A FAMILY place AT ALL. 

Seriously went down in quality since our last visit. We stayed May 22 - May 27, 2014 and our experience was horrible. This property is in serious finical trouble that staff has been cut & reflected in the poor overall impression of this once nice property. 

1) Prior to arriving, I called to request a room upstairs, easy in & out, and a  microwave. Maria, the clerk, told me all rooms have microwaves and assured me I dont need to ask. 

2) CK-IN. The clerk was busy eating a sandwich but was able to check us in.  I requested a quiet room & close distance to a pool /parking. The clerk, (nameless), said my room is upstairs and near pool "2" which is the middle pool on the property.
She did not mention anything about costs/any features about the property or any pool closures during ck-in. 
Example: room service, restaurant hours, property activities, poor tv reception, internet,  etc..  

Went to the room. No microwave.

4) The next morning, I called the front for ice. Closest was pool #2. I went to pool #2. It was drained DRY! A maintenance person was entering the pool and told me this just happened and he was unsure when it will be fixed. He went on to say,  the only operational pool was the 24/7 pool #3  located at the back of the property. The pool closest to the lobby was closed due to lack of life guards for that pool. This is on DAY 2. 

5) The following night, we tried pool #3 again,  the 24/7 pool was constantly filled with hooligans who spent time at the pool smoking, drinking, and using profanity. Each time we went by pool #3" during our 5 nights it was like this. It seemed like security had no control over the situation  or perhaps the property did not budget security properly for these days. THIS IS NOT A FAMILY PROPERTY. 

6) A maintenance person working on the middle pool told me the problem just happened and they were rapidly trying to fix. Several areas around the pool were dug up. Including an area which led underneath the pool where a family of cats were living. The GM seemed to not want to listen to this or deflect to other department

6) On our 4th day, we went to the front pool #1 as another maintenance person told us pool #1 was open today in addition to the 24/7 pool #3. We trusted what he said to be true so we went down to the pool closest to the lobby and were enjoying the sun along with a dozen or so people.

I saw the beverage/food bar at the pool was closed, so I went to my room & called in a order for pick up in the bar lobby. 
As I returned with food, I saw my girlfriend surrounded by Alexis Park security. They told us and the other guests we need to leave this pool immediately due to lack of life guards. I had just purchased food and asked if we could sit and eat. They denied us this option. 
I walked to the front desk and spoke with Florence, the supervisor on duty about this. There were (2) other groups at the front complaining about their experience.  One gentleman was at the desk with his two kids & was upset about lack of security at the 24/7 pool #3 due to the vulgar language & marijuana smoking so he moved to pool "1" closest to the lobby to enjoy his first day at the property.

Florence was unprepared to answer any of the questions anyone had. She referred us to GENERAL MANAGER Sherri Erickson. Sherri the GM was not working on Monday and we had to wait until Tuesday to hear from her. 

Florence did remove our fee for the food order from the bill and asked us to leave the pool. 

After leaving 2 notes, and a phone message for Sherri Erickson, she responded at 11:30 am on May 28. I explained my experience and she constantly interrupted avoiding/denying all . She told me she was busy in a meeting and it felt like it on the call with her. She was rude and unhelpful. She had excuses for all. Even when I was sharing with her my interaction with maintenance staff, front desk staff & security, she was annoyed.  She continually cut me off in mid sentence and told me she was not responsible. She told us the Alexis Park website clearly states the pool condition.

It does not state NO LIFEGUARDS so pools may not be used. And our room cards opened the fence around the pool so how was anyone supposed to know it was off limits? 

So I get my bill, The manager Sherri did remove (1) night due to the pool issue and the other manager Florence did remove our food charges, HOWEVER a new surprised emerged, charges for Internet Service. We never used it. Now I am going to need to dispute this as well. 

So there you have it. Amazing time in Las Vegas, but so sad to see a GM not take responsibility for her staff or crew at a once nice place to stay. 

When I asked  if I can speak with someone else above her, she told me it was not possible as the property is now owned by a Chinese company that cannot be reached. She is the last line for service.This is our second time coming here. We are so disappointed at the service this time.  We were here during lunch time. A lot of plates were empty and they were holding the food on purpose.  They wouldn't bring out the food even though it was ready and customers were asking for it. When some food came out, it would be gone in second. Unless you are willing to stand in front of the buffet for a long time, you will not be able to get a lot of food. The quality of the food is so-so and certainly is not worth the $24 for lunch.Went here for lunch because I heard the food was great.  We started with hummus and baba ganoosh.  Both were fine, BUT we were distracted by the "chef" screaming and swearing at one of the servers.  Each of three times that she passed by the kitchen window he would stop what he was doing and just berate her.  It was awful.  My 8 year old finally said "is that guy making our food?  It is going to be sprinkled with hate".  My sentiments exactly.  We paid for our drinks and appetizers and left.  I really could not understand how the other patrons could just sit there like everything was okay.so the man taking my hubby's order mentions that he should have a veggie sand...why you may ask?  cause he's overweight.  worst customer service ever.  NEVER WILL BE BACK.  this is no joke.  seriously now.  this really happened.Terrible. Make sure you Are friends with the staff before you come in here otherwise you will wait and get attitude the entire time. Worse service ever! Shame on you! Sorry not sorry! Ps- Reggie is better off as a bouncer n not a bartender.The food here is just awful, when my plate arrived from the "seafood experts" my lobster was so dry and it looked super old, tasted like it had been in the freezer for 6 months and then cooked in the microwave, ugh. and my shrimp was soggy like oatmeal, the biscuits were super good. The service was way to much, there were about 6 customers and about 8-10 servers in the restaurant and the servers didn't  have stations so every minute you'd have a server coming by asking you the same question 4 other people just asked us...sooo annoying, our waiter chris was a nice guy and a good server but he messed with customers heads alittle to much, saying jokes that made us feel rude that we didnt laugh because we didnt understand what he was talking about, but when he asked how my food was and i said "gross" he was like "ohhh you should of told me i'd get the manager for you right now if you want" i said "no i'll go to arbys down the street but thank you" he was saying that i should just talk to the manager and take care of it but at that point i just wanted to get out of that place.In walkes a single mom with 5 little kids with her and they sat them right next to us, the mother of the kids actually said to the server "my kids are loud maybe we should sit somewhere else" then looked and me, i just smiled because it was true and i really appreciated her being thoughtful of others, so the server says "ohh no this is fine" luckly the kids were not that bad at all, phew.  The host was just a freak, he was staring at us the entire time we were in the restaurant and wouldnt even look away when we stared back at him like "whaaaaaat" ???? then some other server or hostess came by with our bill and said "for your convenience" which i wanted to say "it's not "convenient" to pay 100 bucks for the worst seafood ever"!!!  (but i didnt i just wanted to escape and fast) so she fails to give me a pen, so i see the host walking by and i say to him "do you have a pen"? and he says "not on me" and pats his pockets, then a server came by and said "ohhh i have one"..I looked at my partner and said "NOT ON ME ? ARE YOU KIDDING?  so walking out the door two girls held the doors for us with smiles and have a good day blah blah blah, so as we are leaving right outside the door is a huge pile of trash so we actually had to step over and into trash " well we thought it was over, then (yes there's more) we were stuck in our car for 5 minutes while two other cars sat behind us arguing about something, it was just so amazing how bad it was. We finally escaped shaking our heads and laughing about how we fly all the way to vegas and one of our dinner plans was going to be red lobster, what a joke! we will never eat there again....grossss! p.s. we tipped chris big because it wasnt his fault.....Went in for a mani pedi. Pedi was okay until I got home and the polish wiped off. I got a mani too so it shouldn't have been wet. It was an hour after the polish was on. My ankles got scrapped up too. The mani was okay but the Polish wasn't put on evenly and I had to file the extra off when I got home. Definitely won't be going back.This place is terrible! I had the lasagna and my wife had the risotto. The meals tasted and looked as if they were pre-prepared and reheated in a microwave. Most over priced piece of sh*t meal I've ever had. Save yourself some time and money and go to Burger Bar.Horrible place!! The man hung up on us mid order saying hurry up I don't have all night! Well guess what. No one is in a hurry to order dominoes lmfao!!! It's food you order when nothing else is available. Like what we tried. LOL! Sorry u hate your life but good night Bahahaha wish I could rate less than zero.Over the years I have dined at many cheap low end Chinese buffets. This is easily the worst.  

Their sign says they have something like 150 (I don't remember exactly) items. I don't see the point of having so many items when stray dogs wouldn't even eat this food.The customer service at this place is just plain awful. I had looked up jewelry repair on yelp and saw that none of the places in my area had exceptional reviews so I decided to go to the manufactures website to see if they had any approved jewelers and once again this place came up so I decided to call them. A woman answered the phone with a voice that sounded like I had just woken her up. When I started to ask how much a battery change would be I didn't get more then two words out before she interrupted me and said "HEY cant you call back later, were not even open right now!" in a rude tone. One I don't like being interrupted and two if you are not open and you don't want to help then don't answer the phone. Very simple.These people have no idea what to sell you. They just point to the startup boxes when I could have saved money buying better items separately. No knowledge on reptile health. Also sold me a turtle with one eye. Really?Do not move here!  By far the worst management I have ever had to deal with!!!!  They are so rude!  Playgrounds are nasty (broken beer bottles and dirty female sanitary napkins).  Things will disappear off of your patio If you are on the bottom floor, the carpets are nasty and there are bugs everywhere!!! I would not recommend this place to anyone!Cigarette smoking is OK, but no cigars.The pool was closed for the evening and the hotel even has a sign, ready to close the pool for any given event. This is not fair for patrons that plan and pay for the use of the pool and are not allowed. Also, it took over two weeks for the Silverton to even respond to my feedback.I've visited Ceres 3 times for the breakfast buffet and 3 for 3 the food was pretty good, but the service was downright awful every time.  Good luck getting the wait staff to notice your existence, and when they do ever bringing you a beverage.  When I finally received a drink I got zero refills, not even a water refill.  The only time I ever had a refill at this place was when I tracked a lady down who was clearing a nearby table and asked her for some water.  She looked at me as if I had caused her a major inconvenience.  I won't be causing any further inconveniences to this restaurant.We came to have a quick lunch on saturday afternoon and although they were not that many people our order took over 20 minutes to come out out of the kitchen. There was only one person preparing the food and all of the other employees were just talking. There were plenty if employees to be able to provide a good service, however that was not the case. It cannot believe it takes over 20 minutes to prepare 2 sandwiches. The manager was on site, but he didn't seem to care too much! I think their is a huge management issue. If you see that you cook needs help, there should b addition staff helping each other! I dont think i'm coming back, there are plenty of good delis in here to waste your time in here!It seemed like nothing here worked. I called downstairs because the tv wasnt working, they said theyd send someone to look at it, after over an hour of waiting we called again and finally they came up and gave us a new remote. The elevator closest to our room was not working for some time so we had to walk to the other side of our floor to take the other elevator. The light in the  bathroom flickered for a while before staying on and was not worth it at all for the price, I would never come back here or reccommend this place to anyone.We came here during St. Patrick's Day so  that was probably our mistake but 1.5 hour waiting at our table for two sandwiches and one was the corned beed special. Overpriced sandwich--I was close to asking giving me the meat and bread and I can make the sandwich myself.The one star is generous. 
This poor poor excuse of a "resort". How dare you charge me a resort fee for wifi and other amenities when the internet NEVER worked, no coffee maker in the room, cable tv would digitize the picture to the point of making it unwatchable, and the rooms don't have a mini fridge. 
Sat at a slot machine for 40 minutes and never saw a cocktail waitress. I had to get up and pay for a luke warm Corona. 
Bartenders walked by us 3 times before we got up and left the bar. 
Wallpaper was peeling off our hotel room wall.
In the sports book, the chair I was sitting in looked like it had been chewed on by a dog. The stuffing was coming out of it. 
The players club perks are a joke. After gambling over 2000.00 we only earned 2.50 in resort credits!!! Man is that a perk or what?? This place stunk!!! Too many other places to stay in vegas that are much nicer and just a bit pricier.Checked into the Monte Carlo tonight, I haven't been this disappointed in a long time. We are suppose to stay here for 3 night's , but we will be checking out tomorrow.  I'd leave tonight but we are exhausted from a long day of traveling.  The place is a dump, carpets are stained, wallpaper peeling off the wall, cracked tiles in the bathroom.  We have an HD TV without HD service. I asked for a fridge in my room, they want $25 a day for it. The Luxor is cheaper and a way nicer hotel. Stay away from this place.Jesus why do i get stuck taking my friends to these frickin places ?!?!?!  don't get me wrong - i enjoy seeing hot chcks ...i'm a guy for crying out loud !  But damn ....$30 to get in ( i get in free now that i'm a "local " )  place is packed ....it made me laugh that they had that posted sign about the max capacity ...999 people ...my buddy and i agreed that had to be a joke ...there's no way it would be safe to allow a thousand people in this place  ...if that's true ...not sure who the spearmint paid but i hope it doesn't bite them in the ass.

the ladies - sure most are pretty ...or at least i think so ...the place is so dark... not sure what a lap dance costs - they have lots of "nooks and crannies "  for privacy .... drinks - i think my beer cost $6 or so ?  i laughed that my buddy bought a double stoli rasberry  with 7-up ( wtf ? ) it cost $20 ....yeah ...

i'm getting too old for this shit ...and the crap i get from my girlfriend ....cocktails !!  cocktails please !All I have to say is BED BUGS!  We had 3 people in the room and all three of us were bit several times.  I called and filed a report with security, although he was polite he did not offer an apology which was disconcerning.  As often as I come to Vegas I will NOT be staying here again nor will I refer people to stay here. One other complaint, however small, the towels were like sandpaper, very rough.We came here for Sunday brunch on the first day of our Vegas trip.  We arrived around 11am after checking into our hotel.  We were starving and craving a nice breakfast.  However, we were sad to learn that unlike other restaurants we were used too, they weren't serving their usual breakfast menu at that time.  They had maybe 5 items on their brunch menu and the rest was off their lunch menu.  I specifically asked the waiter if any other breakfast items were available, but he was unaccomodating.  It was especially dissapointing because the table right next to us were able to order breakfast and they received their food less than 10 minutes before us. As for the food, my boyfriend ordered the waffle with fresh strawberries and whip cream.  It was $15 for ONE waffle that could have came out of a box.  The whip cream that everyone raves about was just meh!  But I must admit that I'm not a huge fan of whip cream in general (waste of calories for something that doesn't even taste that good).  I ordered the quiche which was ok but very rich.  You can definitely taste all the butter and cream they put in it.  It was more of a custard consistency than I'm used to though.  As for the service, our waiter basically sucked and seemed to have airs about him.  He spent most of the time talking in the corner with his friends.  My coffee was never refilled and it took us forever to get our check.  Then it took at least another 10-15 minutes for him to pick it up so he can run our credit card.  We don't usually ask much of our waiters and usually tip very well.  But this was rediculous!  He failed to realize that every minute of his inattentiveness was decreasing his tip.  But maybe the service is better on the outside patio.  We were just too hungry to wait for a table there.  It was immediate seating inside.  Still, a huge dissapointment all around.  Definitely not worth it when there are so many other places to eat on the strip.This hotel is TERRIBLE!  It's under construction and it's a mess to even enter. My room was new, but the bathroom was original & bad!  I couldn't turn the shower on, the handle was broken,  so I called the desk at 10am for someone to fix it. At 5pm I still hadn't taken a shower because NO ONE CAME UP TO FIX IT!  When I checked out I asked for them to take $ off. The desk mgr Sara was rude & snotty!!!!  She took $35 off. Whoohoo!  $35!  She wouldn't even take the $20 resort fee off. Her explanation was..." EVERYONE PAYS THE RESORT FEE!"  Do not go there!  Go to THE RIO!!!!  And the Rio I hear has a great buffet!  Or ANYWHERE ELSE but THERE!!!!  I wouldn't even give it one star but I couldn't post this w/o a star!Outdated. Rooms are not too bad but tv channel lineup is nowhere to be found. And there is like 4 channels that come in. Paper thin walls as well. Stay somewhere else.A SEVERE disappointment. We got there yesterday with a 10pm reservation.

1. The waiter never greeted us, or even introduced himself. He just walked up--leaned over my wife, and started creepily poking her menu for possibilities. 
2. The bussing staff started reaching for things to take away (even plates covered with food, still being eaten) without even asking (I don't playing like tug of war in a seemingly fancy restaurant).
3. My main steak frites dish came LOADED with fries (not complaining) accompanied by a cold depressingly undercooked lump of meat (complaining).
4. I asked to have the dish wrapped to go. I opened the bag this morning to find only that sad brown lump..with no fries (and there were tons left on the plate).
5. I gave the waiter a 20% tip (which he did NOT deserve), and he never thanked us nor bid us a good night (though I had done both to him). 

The Yountville, CA establishment is worlds better. I've been to that Bouchon multiple times and had zero issues. Don't even bother with this one in Vegas.Horrible!  Went there last night with friends for a birthday and all four meals were bad.  Save your money and go anywhere elseI'm not going to lie, the buffet itself was pretty good.  The prime rib for me was more of a highlight than the kobe flank.  

BUT the wait staff were HORRIBLE!!  Our waiter brought the wrong drink and never bothered to check in on our table afterwards to see how we were doing. The plates weren't picked up in a timely manner as well.  He didn't re-fill our drinks the whole evening until...  at the end of our meal, I said to my table "i think our waiter kind of sucked."  My brother and cousin were looked at me and said "He's right behind you."  Ok, I might be a jerk for saying that.  He clearly heard me because he only brought my cousin back another drink.  He didn't even look at me.  Even though the service was poor, we tipped him 15%.  The money was slightly tucked under a plate and we watched him when we left.  He first thought we didn't tip him and he shot us a dirty look and gathered his other wait staff around him to watch us.  Later on he found the tip and just put it in his pocket.  Punk.  TERRIBLE WAIT STAFF make for an UNPLEASANT dining experience.okay whats up with the good reviews for this place? all i thought about when i entered this place was that it reminded me of my high school dance. the music was complete crap. sorry but i don't wanna hear Mariah Carey at a vegas club. rarely any seats. being that most of the girls are wearing 4inch & higher heels, walking up the stairs to enter the club is such a bitch. umm yeah never again. luckily i was on the guestlist and got in for free or else i would have been SUPER pissed.I. HATE. THIS. CLUB.

The only cool thing about it, is the walk up to the club. It's really freakin' awesome.

Other than that, the club is layered in three floors. The door men are the douchiest on the Strip! (And that is saying something, especially because Criss Angel is on the Strip daily.)

The music here is lame. The people that show up here are lame. This place is also an Asian Fest. I love Asians, but if you aren't Asian, you will be waiting in line forever and ever and ever. Even if you are on the guest list.

One reason I hate this place so damn much was that after waiting in the guest line, Kevin Federline shows up and cuts me. Are you kidding me? It I told you I fucked Britney Spears, would you let me cut too? He's not even relevant anymore. 

This place sucks more than all the Hoovers in the world combined!I have very NEGATIVE feelings about Tao - I have never in my life felt more disgusted about any establishment. I had to deal with borderline harassment from their security and bad service. There are so many better options to choose from in Vegas, and Tao should really be your last and let me reiterate LAST option. I believe the current yelp ratings comparatively to other clubs speak for themselves if you have to ask me. 

The first time I came to Tao it was for Hardwell on a Thursday night, the weekend before NYE 2012. Earlier that evening my friends and I arrived early for the ladies open bar happy hour. I ordered a drink and one of my guy friends took one small sip from it. Seconds later, two of the security men stormed up to me, grabbed me, and took me into a small room by the back wall without any explanation. 

My friends were screaming and banging on the door asking for them to release me as they were very worried. One of the security guards very rudely explained that because it was a ladies open bar, I was not allowed to have my guy friend take a sip from my drink. 

Ok - but lets be real here - if that were the case did it really require them to take me to a secluded room away from the public and put me in harms way? They could have just told me in the presence of others, as it is not a big issue. I am glad that they released me after explaining, but really, none of that was necessary. That experience left a bitter taste, as it was unnecessary trauma. 

My second experience was more recent. I was at Tao for a joint bachelor/bachelorette party two weekends ago for Fabulous. Because the couple decided to do a package deal, we had dinner earlier at the Tao Bistro for 15 people. As part of the package, there was dinner and bottle service provided for the group. As soon as we got to the club, we were given a table outside of the main room which was not ideal but that was ok. 

FYI, the food at Tao Bistro is really just mediocre Asian fusion food and not worth the money. 

Now onto the incompetent service. The group was kept waiting for almost 2 hours for the table service because the hostess could not match the package deal to the credit card on file without having the actual credit card that made the purchase. The entire dinner/club packaged was already paid for and yet there was a problem? Because of the wait, our group just cancelled the table service. That kind of service is unacceptable. At the very least, because of the incompetence, our dinner was reduced in price. 

Most people in the group were only in Vegas for one night, specifically to be at Tao, and Tao ruined this experience especially for the future bride and groom. Honestly I thought my second experience would be better. 

Ironically, for a club Tao is a buzzkill. 

Tao, see you never!we came for the night club and it was not impressive, most of the customers are obese,huge,gigantic,oversize,extra extra=extra large and the music they play are most boring,not motivated to dance. they do not serve food after 11;00 PM. GOOD THING THEY DIDN'T SERVE FOOD FOR THESE PEOPLEWow!  Let's just say I'm super disappointed!  I've seen this show now five times over the past four or five years.  Of the 5...the past four were mild to great.  They've toned the show down so much and now have less experienced talent than before.  I'm sure there's more than one cast but I've always seen a very talented cast.  Sooo...every time I've seen the show they've changed it more and more.  Pretty much for the worst.  This last time was so unbelievable how bad it was I wanted my money back.  After politely contacting Cirque they do not bother to respond.  So now...the gloves come off!  Wow....Cirque!  You're really something else.  Another big company that doesn't give a rats _ _ _ about our hard earned money!   They take your $168 per seat and give you a show now that's so bad...really take my advise...do not go see it.  You'll be sorry!  I feel bad for the very talented performers mixed with other folks, notice I didn't say other performers, that just stand there and look pretty.  What a disappointment for someone that works so hard and proud to be a part of something so spectacular to just end up having a "bla" cast to work with.

Let's talk about the show.  Back...oh...I would say four or five years ago when I saw the first show.  Wow!  I was really on the edge of my seat.  Let's compare the differences from then to now.

First...opening sequence.  Before no narration...now there is.  Not needed really.  I have no judgment either way.

Second...the rotating stage comes out of the "Void" where it appeared to be a ship with rowers. This turned into a ritual scene.  This involved multiple people doing acrobats, sword stunts, spear stunts and let's say lots of action and energy.  So much happening you would want to come back and watch again to catch what you missed.  The next three shows pretty much the same.   However, this last show...wow...people just standing on the stage on both sides while one so called performer twirls a stick and occasionally slaps it on the ground.  My head was nodding like you see some folks in church.  I was really really very unhappy with what I saw.  My niece and nephew were like...huh?  What's all the hoopla?  Great music but no action to match.  Something just did not add up here.

Third...the long haired villain, which I've always liked.  He was so much fun even though he was the bad guy.  He was not there this evening but they replaced him with a far less experienced person.  Notice again I did not say performer.  This guy did not even climb on the wall near the battle scene towards the end of the show.  To make matters worse, near the end of the battle scene, the "emperor" (guy in yellow shoes) falls in pain due to one of his warriors, one of many dies.  What?  My niece and nephew said the same thing.  What's so important about the regular fighter?  It just didn't have the energy there had it been the villain.  In the past four shows, when the villain is defeated and fallen...the stage rotates with theatrical fog, lights, and music to match.  The emperor comes over to comfort his fallen com-rad as the stage rotates downward into the void.  A scene that stuck with me from the beginning.   This time it just lost it's energy and for my niece and nephew they were confused as to what the point was.

Fourth, the jungle scene...in the past the jungle music always began with the scene.  This time...the jungle scene was about over when the jungle music came on.  Later when we were discussing the show my niece and nephew said...oh was that a jungle?  Duh...

Cirque...music is really key to a production.  You know that!  

The jungle scene was followed by the air ballet for lack of a better way to describe.  These two individuals put on a stellar performance.  She's nicely shaped and petite and he's very strong.  Fake long hair.  Oooopppss...I think I'm going bald!  

The Mexican wheel stuntmen always put on a absolute hair raising performance.  You always hear the audience gasp and a super cheer for them.  Applause to you guys!!!

Fifth...the rotating stage.   During the scene where there are supposed arrows hitting the ground.  They simulate this with spikes or stems that come up from the rotating stage floor.  With semi slip shoes and these spikes they used to rotate the stage really fast with the performers moving all over.  This included folks falling into the void.  That was really crazy to watch.  This last time though...wow...they just chase each other and some falling with the stage moving ever so so slow.  When the stage did speed like in the past, everyone just hung on to the spikes and or edge.  Acting like they're trying to keep from falling off.  Really not exciting at all.

I could keep writing but I think I've given Cirque too much of my time and money.  Bottom line is..they have this spectacular stage, theater, and music but the actors are not always up to providing the best performance possible.  Cirque has lowered it's standards, not prices.The one star is for the variety of foods on the menu. The non-stars-everything else. My boyfriend and I went in for a quick bite before a show. The waitress sat us promptly, and had our first drinks back to us in fairly short order. That is the last good part of the review. After taking our orders, she seemed to forget we were there, not checking on us after our food was delivered, would walk the other way when we made it clear we wanted assistance or refills. It wasn't until my boyfriend placed his empty glass over our heads on the partition next to us before refills were brought. Funnily enough, she managed to deliver the check on the spot wordlessly when we asked for it though. The chicken salad sandwich was bland, piled high with so many toppings I could barely fit it in my mouth. After adding salt and pepper, it still remained awful, especially when I started biting into small chunks of raw garlic and onion. I could have gone to the nearest 7-Eleven and had a chicken salad sandwich that had been sitting there all day that was better than this one. My boyfriend had a Chicken Caesar Salad-something that's pretty hard to mess up, as it is a staple on most menues. The chicken was almost completely flavorless, and rather dry, the salad was mixed crispy and crunchy greens and yesterday's limpy greens, and the dressing tasted like pure mayonnaise. The most flavor in that dish was the oversized croutons, so I'm guessing they didn't bake the bread themselves, because that actually had flavor. Casino prices are normally higher that anywhere else, but these were absurd. Avoid this place if you can. You'll likely get better food from room service.I hate to have to do this because all in all, I do like the food here, but a few things about them really turn me off and this last experience was my last straw. 

We went for lunch and our waitress ordered the wrong dish for me, and she was very nice and admitted it was her fault and apologized. I am pretty easy going so I had no big issue with it, except it took a VERY long time for me to get what I ordered, and by the time I did, my husband had finished his food and was ready to go. It really did throw things off and cause us to be delayed in general for getting back to work during our lunch hour, not to mention a big inconvenience to wait that long when I was really hungry!  

I figured because of their own mistake and how incredibly long it took for me to finally get my meal they would just comp me my dish. Any restaurant would, I thought.  But when the waitress brought over the check she said, "I talked to my manager and he is taking off $4 from your dish because of the wait".  Wow....how generous.  My dish was $11.   Might as well just not do anything.  FOUR DOLLARS?  Please, it was really adding insult to injury here.  I had to wait forever to get it and it was a huge inconvenience, and it occurred due to THEIR MISTAKE, not me just ordering the wrong thing.

To compound this experience, there were several times in the past where we felt generally the same thing...they are very cheap and tight with what they'll do for their customers. I had been going for years and I mean regularly. I had been a loyal customer since before they moved their location. Any by loyal I mean coming in once a week. They knew me and always recognized how often I come in. And I would bring new friends and people with me too, so they probably got a ton of business from not just me, but all the people I would bring!

So one time I asked if they would consider donating toward a fundraiser I was doing for dog rescue by giving a gift certificate for $20 or something. I was told by one of the owners "sorry, no, we have already done our quota for the year for donations".  This was a bit of shock to me considering how regular of a patron I was.  But I joked with by boyfriend at the time that I liked their food enough that I would probably still go back, even though that really pissed me off. 

I'm sure they could have put their kids through college the first year on the income from just me and all the friends I have brought there. I couldn't believe it was too much to just give a gift certificate for a fundraiser to one of their most loyal customers?  

Obviously they are not concerned at this point with good customer service, only churning out as many meals and making as much profit as possible.  For that reason, and for the insulting $4 comp to my check this last time, we are not going back. They have lost a very long time loyal patron.We came here because their buffet line was packed... I wish we starved ourselves instead. Our food seriously took 1+hr to arrive! You would think a Rigatoni Bolognese is simple, how can they f*ck this dish of mushrooms, sausages, and rigatoni up, right? WRONG! My dish came out looking like hamburger helper. I didn't see any sign of mushrooms or sausages; it was just rigatoni drowning in a chili-like sauce. Top it off, it didn't even taste good! Horrible, especially at $17!! Our party had other dishes that was horrible, including their seafood pasta, which didn't even have any sauce! When my friends asked, they just brought out a bowl of sauce... nice, what great service. I could've done better with a bottle of Ragu.I will not return to Fix!  ...and you shouldn't either!

We were staying next door at Aria for opening weekend and decided to try FIX next door at Bellagio. 

We decided to take our time, ordering a couple appetizers at a time until we decided on the entrees while having our drinks.  The sliders were ok, the calamari: decent... it wasn't until we received our lobster tacos that we realized we had chosen the wrong restaurant.  

$22 for 4 extremely tiny mini lobster tacos!  Almost no lobster and the worst part was they were ice cold, as if they had been pulled out of the refrigerator and served!  The piece of cilantro on top was bigger than the entire taco shell!

The waiter kept asking us if we wanted to order a bottle of wine... we were having drinks from the bar and weren't interested.  Then we noticed the only tables getting good service were the ones with wine! We couldn't even remember which waiter was ours since we only saw him maybe once or twice!  We were ready to order entrees but never had a chance because  all the waiters in the restaurant were hanging around the hostess stand. 
A large table of 6 seated nearby left after their appetizers because of the terrible service, and the waiters did nothing to try to stop them... they literally stood up and walked out! I don't even think they ended up paying!

Now we know why the restaurant was almost empty on a night that should've been full!  Not to mention, the bathroom was not clean... considering they have a bathroom attendant right outside the door!  

*btw, if you're looking for some GOOD lobster tacos, try Blue Martini in Towne Square!  They actually use the entire lobster tail in one piece in a large flour tortilla they way it should be! And if you go during happy hour, they're half price!Thanksgiving, ruined !
Dont' ever, EVER, think about going here for Thanksgiving!  First of all, the food was terrible. Over salted. Just awful.  Second they ran out of food, or perhaps do not know how to plan well.  Third, they ran TWO HOURS late for our confirmed reservation!
Ridiculous- ran out of proscuitto for their own Maggiano's salad!  They obviously were running low on food by the time we were seated. (5:15 reservation, seated at 7:15!)
For seven adults, they place two ice cream scoops of mashed potatoes on a small plate in the center of the table-for seven people!  Then the turkey platter looked like  a sad plate of leftovers-and had one little mound of stuffing- which was gone after it was passed to the second person. We kept thinking that was decoration, and they would bring some in a bowl (aka family style). Same for the ham platter, one little scoop of sweet potatoes for seven adults!  The pasta course however, was abundant --apparently the only thing they know how to cook.  They brought two big bowls of pasta for side dishes. Everything was horribly over salted!  The gravy -also they must have been running out of...was a tiny little coffee cup sized dish of milky white looking blah gravy??   I cannot repeat enough it was HORRIBLE.  Two ten year olds could pull together a better turkey dinner.   They have a lot of nerve charging $40 per person!I'm not sure why everyone loves this place.  Maybe it's the gigantic portions of meat they serve.  I was not impressed by the veggie section of the menu...oh wait, there's not one...and no, I don't like oatmeal or f-ing grapefruit for breakfast.  ick.  I've waited in line once--that'll be enough for me, Matt.*********************DON'T DO IT!!!*******************

WOW, where to start?!  The Mr. and I had "vouchers" to this buffet because we purchased them in a package deal with the "Legends" show.  

This by far was the worst buffet I've ever been to!! The food was either too salty or completely flavor less.  Their selection I suppose is good, it's just a shame the food sucks!!  But the water was good..hehe :)

I would certainly warn to stay away from the sushi.  The rolls we saw were dry and the avocado was browning...yeah brown!! No bueno!! The crab legs smell very fishy and the meat was chewy and rubbery.  Their chow mein noodles were hard and overly sautéed in garlic....yes it's possible to use too much garlic.

Seeing that we were not having much luck with the food we moved on to desert.  The ice-cream was ok, but then again how can you mess up store bought ice-cream.  Their custard was more of a jello grainy consistency, not custard at all.

Overall, this was not a good dining experience.  If you're going to try a buffet don't try this one, save your money and go elsewhere!!Did we just get there TOO early or what?

I heard good things about this and dragged my friends there after the buffet. It had 1 long table and some smaller ones on the other side. Where's the live music? 

No one was at the front and when we walked in, there were about half dozen people drinking. No music, no service. Walked in and walked out.Two crappy drinks. How can you mess up a martini or manhattan? They did both! And then I wanted to get water for a friend and they don't serve tap water, only Fiji.Service was good, food was poor quality and poorly prepared.  Price was to high for the food quality.Seriously!!!! most DISGUSTING place ever! had a hair in the dumpling of the dim sum one time which will be my ever last time to go there! Talked to them with the hair, the services took the one away and come back without an apologize or anything and walk away again. What a nice service and the food made me so sick all day! HAIR in a Dumpling! EWWWW. even the boss was on the services site and said, "well, if she said no then it is no." so that means me, as a customer, is laying? how FUNNY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!11I was thoroughly unimpressed with this venue for many reasons....

 1. it took 25 minutes to obtain a tasty beverage (beer) and about as long for glasses of water. (the restaurant was NOT even 25% full!)
2. the waiter "strolled" by with his Faux Hawk to take our order about 45 minutes later.
3. when the food finally came a member of our party found something mysterious in her burger.
4. we displayed mysterious item mentioned in #3 to said Faux Hawk and he appropriately took the plate away. however did not omit the vulgar item from the bill until we explicitly asked.
bottom line, the grilled salad i had was good, but not good enough to warrant a second trip to Cook N Jacks or a recommendation to anyone.I was craving a cheese steak and went to this place yesterday. One cheese steak was almost 10 bucks and I didn't get fries or anything with it (maybe that was extra) the meat in the sandwich tastes just like that frozen steakum crap you get at the grocery store and it was dripping with grease. Yuck! One of the guys behind the counter was kind of an ass too. I will never eat there again!This place is terrible, from the food to the service.  Add some atrociously (even by Vegas' standards) high prices & you have a losing situation.  I officially deem this the biggest rip off of a restaurant I have ever eaten at in my life.

I had the most bland roast chicken I have ever tasted .  Came with pasty mashed potatoes & 'steamed veggies', which was half cooked broccoli.  Also sampled were the hot turkey sandwich (ok, but for $22 for a SANDWICH it should have been waaaayy better), liver sandwich (blech) & the daily special - shrimp dinner (frozen fried shrimp from a box).

Even the free pickles they give you were pretty gross.  Everyone had one bite, then just left them.  Service was pretty lame & indifferent, which can work in an actual New York deli, but definitely does not in Vegas.  Don't waste a minute of your time or a penny of your money at this place.Although I love the food at Eden's Grill, I can't eat there any longer. 

Recently I met a friend there for a late lunch. We had just finished up and were deciding on desert when 3 women accompanied by three young children came in. 

The kids ran up and down the aisles yelling loudly.  None of the women made any attempt to control them.  When the kids started going in and out of the entrance door, the owner came out of the back and asked them to stop because the door was heavy and she didn't want them to catch their fingers - an injury that might make the restaurant liable.  Other than that, she stayed in the back rather than ask the women to control their children 

Those unruly kids ruined our lunch - which cost us around $40.  We couldn't even hear ourselves speaking and wound up leaving earlier than we would have otherwise. Obviously the owner cared enough to speak up when it concerned liability for her business but not when her customers were being inconvenienced.Worst food, and worst service.  Will never go back to Red Robin.  Do not waste your time and money.  It is horrible.My reason for the low rating is due to misinformation about their happy hour buffet regulations. I did some researching before heading last night and nowhere did I read about an age restriction in order to partake in the section where they hold the buffet. So when my husband and I and our friends, who had a baby with them tried going in we were shocked to learn we wouldn't be allowed to go in because we had a baby with us. Yet none of this information was posted any where so we were all surprised. Also the fact that there was no manager present did not help our situation, what place doesn't have a manager present at all times? What made things worst was how the host who went by choo choo came off to us as rude when dealing with our situation. We had a big group of friends waiting for us at the patio, where we could of easily been seated but had to turn away and leave our friends because they refused to let us go in. Disappointing costumer service to say the least.Yea...I got in free for a reason.  They just want anyone in there.Great food here; had the goat cheese marinara appetizer, filet oscar and the special, "mouse king" (strip with porcini butter). Steaks were amazing, and the appetizer was tasty. The service was stellar and the ambiance was hip, old school cigar bar feel.

However, at 2 and 4 am, both my husband and I were up VERY ill; the only thing we shared was the goat cheese-- perhaps it was not handled properly or poorly stored, but I have never heard my husband whimper from stomach pain and cramps before in my life! Needless to say, it turned our lovely date night into a long, excruciating overnight for the both of us. I am not sure we would return after such an incident. Had we not gotten ill, I would have rated an easy 4 stars.Fail.
Why? Just compare it to the old restaurant that used to be housed here and that's the only word that comes up. On further thought an acronym comes to mind: WTFHorrible experience! I don't know if they have some kind work program going on or what. No real rules. Hostess told my party of 4 we can take any high top at the bar then another hostess came and told us we need to get up since they are going to seat the table with a party of 3 since that's the maximum allowed at that table. Also then told us all the high tops are reserved. Story kept changing then we left management sux!!!!!This is the place that I had sushi while I was in Vegas about a year ago that made me feel sick. Just stay away! Everything else seemed rather sub-par even though the selection was fairly large. Not much to say about this place, but...I rather just have a go at Todai instead of this shack. 

Save yourself some money and go somewhere else. It's not worth it.if you like frozen lower then mediocre costco seafood, standing in line for way over 30 minutes at a time, and think jerry springer guests are celebrities. then this is the place for you!

so many great places in vegas i have no idea why yelpers are giving this place such high reviews.

oyster bar has the worst oysters we have ever had. on a postive note, i give the bloody marys and people watching 5 stars!!This review is purely based on Layers lack or customer service.  I read their "philosophy" on food and it pretty much tells you we make it the way we want it and if you don't like it get out.  Guess what?  I'm out!The food was extremely bland. I used a liberal helping of salt in the mushroom soup, and that improved the flavor a little bit. The cheese on the panini wasn't melted, and the chicken had no flavor. The bruschetta was overly flavored with garlic and syrupy balsamic vinegar, instead of being balanced. Even the soda tasted off.Only been here once, and once was enough. The place is absolutely crap. Not that I typically care about decor, but it was dingy as hell inside - in fact, your bog standard Denny's is like a Taj Mahal by comparison.

As others have commented, there was some ethnic fair-skinned girl on duty when we went. I know she was Ukrainian because the couple behind us picked up on the accent (which was almost too thick to understand) and asked her. Not exactly authentic, but then again that's something else I'm not typically concerned with.

What I am concerned with, however, is food quality - in particular places that skimp on stuff. I got a saag dish - can't remember what it was, probably beef or aloo - and it was completely drowned in the saag (pureed spinach). Wife got the butter chicken, same thing - 80% sauce, 20% meat. And the taste was just a-ight, nothing special at all which made it even more annoying. I could have cooked the same thing at home for a tenth the price.

During the course of the meal, I noticed something which looked like a black beetle with its innards spilling out. I've seen plenty of cardamom seeds in my time, but the ones I'm used to are khaki-ish-greenish in colour and a lot smaller than this was. I called Ms Ukraine over and asked her what it was. She - get this - gave me a scared expression and said in her halting English "I.. not know! don't eat it!!" then scurried off. Don't eat it?! I had a sniff of the seed and it was definitely a cardamom - evidently a Giant Black North American Cardamom. Frankly, looking at the place I wouldn't have been surprised if it -was- a beetle.

Never going back. I wouldn't have even if the server HADN'T have advised me not to eat the food. Best Indian on the west side remains Tandoori Times II on NE cnr 57th and W Bell, and even that's a far cry from what I've had in Sydney and San Fran. I second Mr K.'s observation - avoid this place.The downfall of what I call "hotel laziness syndrome"...you submit yourself to restaurants within the hotel that just don't quite cut it.

As if it's 3 and a half stars wasn't already an indication for me to stay away...but no I decided to give it a shot (fail).

My girlfriends and I ordered a round of udon noodle soups and sushi rolls. What did we receive? lukewarm soup with about 8 strings of udon. Oh, and the jalapenos in the soup...nice touch but I'm pretty sure authentic japanese udon soups do without em and they taste just fine (if not better). My spicy tuna rolls came with 6 teenie tiny pieces. My wallet definitely took a bullet that night but I might as well have dodged that bullet with my stomach cause 1) the food was not satisfying and 2) I was STILL hungry.

Service? What service? My card currently has three transactions (2 processing) from Japonais and I've only dined there ONCE. We explained to our server how much to charge on each of our cards and she managed to mess that up even after explicit directions. Our food took about an hour to make and not once did she come over to our table to apologize for the slow service. 

Ambiance? eh. Sat in the bar/lounge area and was utterly uncomfortable during the entire duration of my meal. My knees kept hitting the lounge tables cause they were so awkwardly low. I was literally hunched over my meal....not okay.

After my horrible experience at Japonais...i've learned my lesson about walking that extra 5 minutes to eat at a better restaurant. I'd rather give my money where its deserved.I saw this place had a Groupon so I hopped on Yelp to look at the reviews.  Since they were positive I decided to buy it because the reviewers made me really excited about this place.  What a bust!  I will say that whenever I am excited about a restaurant and I see low reviews, I generally think those people are babies.  It's them that I should have listened too.  And here goes one of the whiners...

The area of town and the outside of the restaurant prompted my wife to comment that she 'felt like she was in another city'.  I thought to myself 'exactly the reason this place is going to be so great'.  Inside was the same story.  The decor was so odd and unflattering that I thought again to myself,'this place is going to be great'!  The sauce all over my menu just sealed it for me.  Greatness!  What I'm trying to say is that if you have 20 or so reviews and you still have 4 stars then I will overlook all of this garbage because you MUST have great food.

After three different people took different orders from us we ended up with our house salad.  Greatest salad ever?  Nope.  The salad had to be from a bag and it was covered (COVERED!) in ranch dressing.  To top it off there was about an inch of water covering the bottom of the bowl.  (I made sure to post a pic of it.)  Gross.  We couldn't even eat it and I was starving!  When they took the salad bowls away they asked why we hadn't eaten it...oh wait, I was dreaming.  They didn't even acknowledge the fact that the salad was untouched.  Then the food came out and I was staring at some round piece of food that was supposed to be a Chile Relleno (Picture).  I have had a number of Chile Rellenos in my day and none of them have ever been round.  I will spare you all the drama to say it was the worst Chile Relleno I've ever eaten.  The sauce was so odd that I couldn't even gag it down.  My wife's enchiladas were also pretty bland/bad.  

I truly cannot even believe this place has 4 stars.  This was the most disappointed I have been in a long time.  I was so excited about this place and I thought it would be a great, hidden place to tell my friends about.  Amigos Cantina at Fiesta Henderson is waaaaay better and they don't have 4 stars.  Come on!On one of our trips to Vegas we stayed at Excalibur and decided to try out the buffet because it was close and cheap...big mistake!

The food looked disgusting and tasted just ok. My boyfriend cracked a tooth with one of the ribs that was supposed to be boneless but wasn't.

My friend picked up two ice cream cones that looked like they had flies baked into the bottom. When we brought it to the attention of the attendants, they said it was from the cast iron forms they are cooked in, yeah right!

Needless to say, I will not be returning here.Food was fresh enough, but couldn't find a trace of actual flavor anywhere... Highlight of the meal was the Coke, with the egg drop soup coming in 2nd place... And that was only after I doctored it up a bit.  Hubby had hot & sour soup, a double lie.  Potstickers were huge & cooked perfect, but no flavor to them nor in the dipping sauce (tasted like watered down soy only).  Hubby's General Tso's Chicken was very bland, and the chicken was very dry. My Chicken Chow Mein (soft noodles) was also very bland, but at least the chicken was moist.  I boxed mine to take home for doctoring up, but his food was left behind to be tossed out.  All in all, a very disappointing experience.Pad Thai has effectively nailed themselves into a coffin and out of my life forever.  I was never much of a fan of them in the first place but their lunch specials were so affordable and delivery so quick.  The temptation was simply too hard to resist.  After the last two visits, though, my co-workers are on board with finding a new place to go for our Thai fix and for good reason.

Reason 1, the last time I ordered the name sake dish, Pad Thai, off the lunch menu I received a mushy mass of noodles that were almost too hot for me to eat even though I ordered only a level 2 spice as I have in the past.  I crunched down on so many pepper seeds that I was starting to gag.  Then there were the pieces of I don't even know what that I could not crunch though at all.  It was like grains of sand.  I tossed most of that dish.  Thankfully they did give me a scoop of fried rice which I actually rather like.

Reason 2, today's order was met with all kinds of disappointment.  One of my co-workers ordered Cashew Chicken with steamed rice as she always does.  And the last two or three times we have ordered she has received fried rice instead.  Luckily I did get steamed rice with my meal so I just switched out the rices for one another.  And the inaccuracies do not end there.  I ordered chicken egg foo young today.  I don't have a damn clue what I actually received.  It cerainly did not look like any egg foo young that I am used to.  And there was absolutely no chicken in it whatsoever.  What ever I got seemed more like a fried mash of thinly sliced onion rings.  And to top it off there was no gravy.  How do you have egg foo young withouth gravy?  It is even mentioned in the menu description for crying out loud.  But wait, there's more.  I received a large bowl of chicken soup with a thick broth, chicken, a few pieces of shredded carrot and some green onion.  It was tasty but I did not order it.  I guess some other poor soul is going to get a cup of gravy in place of their soup.

Reason 3, Pad Thai has raised their prices a couple of times in the past year or so.  I understand inflation happens but they have coupled the price increase with a serving size decrease.  Why would anybody pay $1-$2 more for half the amount of food?  I would rather pay the higher prices at the places that give you more food.This place is awful... I like dive bars. I really do... but I don't like dive bars that completely discriminate. I mean, seriously, who does that!? It's 2013! If you are not a "biker" of some sort you're unwelcomed.. and they make it very apparent.

When we were walking up wearing jeans and a t shirt, the whole "crew" on the patio stopped the whole conversation and turned to stare at us walk in. Then once we were inside, we had to pretty much hound the bartender for drinks. They make it SO well known that if you are not a biker, or trailer trashy, you are NOT welcomed. It's insane that a place SO discriminatory would still exist in 2013 and even more so, in a place as diverse as Surprise, AZ. 

Although, the drinks can be fairly cheap (given whatever the bartender decides to do-over charge or charge you for what you actually got) and they're strong, the unfriendly and lousy service is not worth it. 

I'm never giving this crap hole my money again.I loved this place bc of the sundubu combo but due to there services I will no longer be going there . Pretty much every time i was there i ran into some kind of problem with the service...
the first time they lady didn't even wait to hear our orders before leaving she just ordered , she cut my friend off as he was talking so when the orders came out instead of 2 combos and one soup she ordered 3 combos 
2nd time we found a hair in the food and not just a small hair but long and white -_-;;. but fortunately she was able to take back the food immediately and bring one a new one for us.
3rd was the last strike we went on a Tuesday night after we ordered we expected the side dishes to come out earlier like it usually does but no we waited and we couldn't even get any service to come near us. got the food which was the only reason why we still come here.throughout the meal they checked up on us once? and when we asked for more side dishes they gave us dirty looks, by the end of the meal we never even got a refill on the water. but lastly i'm guessing she was the manager or something she brings us the check when were finishing up eating and left it alone since one of our friends was eating , but when she returned to see the check wasnt paid she was like please pay your bill ( like wtf? cant you see someone is still eating) we felt so rushed to get out even when the restaurant is 24 hours and there wasnt many people. But the thing that really pissed us off was when we left we put the tip under one of the side dishes so i guess it wasnt easy to see? but the lady who took our bill ran back to us and asked us " where is the tip??" WOW REALLY!? after u rushed us to finish our meals and get out you actually think you deserved tip? tip is privilege not a mandatory.
seriously cant get over how bad the service is, it'll be a while before I go back or even go back at all unless they fix there services.Are you kidding me, from the grease soaked walls to the greasy inedible food, to the roaches that crawled across our table......THUMBS DOWN! 
After about 20 minutes into our meal and roach crawled across our table not to mention the few we saw on the walls. This place was so dirty, I needed a shower when we got home. DISGUSTING, DEPLORABLE, GREASY FOOD!I live in Los Angeles and I come out to AZ every other month. I have been to Sushi Ken many times, and every time I have had terrible service. This last visit was the last straw. The girl who was our server approach us with such a poor attitude and a sour look on her face. Needless to say, we tried not to ask her for much. At the beginning of our order, I notified her that I will need to place a to go order toward the end of the meal. She walked by our table many times, while our water glasses were empty, she never once stop to ask us if we needed anything or just fill our water glasses. 

I then asked her nicely, that when she had a chance, could we get some more water. She then said, "don't you need to place an order to go?" I said "yes, but when you bring the water, we can do it then". She walked over, slammed a pitcher of water on the table and then walked away. I proceeded to serve our table the water, then walked over to the register to place my to go order and pay my bill.

I have never in my life stiffed a waitress. However, in this case it was necessary. The waitress followed me out to the parking lot and asked me where I had left the tip.
 
I told her that expecting a tip for NOT doing your job is not the way it goes. T.I.P. means "To Insure Promptness" and since I did the job for her, she did not deserve a tip.

The unfortunate thing, is that the sushi is actually good and affordable. I might suggest take-out for this place.Coming to Vegas I was told I must try this place, the food is delicious, the atmosphere is fun and it was a must experience. 

After coming here I won't be coming back. The evening started out on a positive. Liked the idea and the decorations and atmosphere, but the food was sub par for the price. It said steakhouse so I ventured for the $40 steak. My friend had to change her order due to them being out of food and she was also not impressed with the selection. 

We did make reservations and asked about the special to make sure it was still going on when we called. We were assured it was. However, after we ate the waitress brings the bill and after inspection find out the special was not honored.  She then told us that the special was for locals only and we were clearly not locals. 

They did finally honor the discount, but not without complaint.  The waitress told me that "next time I just need to be aware". Maybe I should've read more reviews or maybe they should mention that when calling to make reservations.  Either way there will be no next time for this patron.Absolutely horrible service. 

After a great time at the mob museum, my date and I read some of the good reviews and decided we should check this place out.
I should have looked at the bad reviews too.
When we walked in, we pretty much got yelled at because they didn't open for another hour. We said okay fine, we'll be back. 
We went back an hour later, same guy opened the door and asked if we had a reservation. We said no. He said he has no room for us and we can just go and sit at the bar. He did a really offensive gesture and then walked off. 

Still standing there in shock, like umm did that really just happen.
We decided not to sit at the bar. Especially since we didn't know where the bar was, it's so dark you can't see anything in there.  We couldn't even see how to get out, so we had to wait for him to come back. When he finally did come back, we asked him why he didn't let us know we needed a reservation when we were there an hour earlier. He said 'now you know' and left.

I'm glad I didn't eat there. Ridiculous!Do yourself a favor and do not bother.  The toughest part of writing this review is I love the concept of Frys, I used to love just going into their store and indulging in their stuff.  But boy everything that has happened, I am going to tell you that this would not be well advised.  First I decided to take the advice of the computer gurus that worked in the computer section only to find that the machine I have was inferior to much better models found at Best Buy for a better price. FAIL. Then I decided to put the laptop I purchased on there one year free financing program.  Simple enough. No. Stay. Away. Try setting up payment on their system.  It is archaic and most likely designed back in 2002.  Seriously try it yourself, go to:

https://corecard.i.frys.com/frysselfservice/Pages/ServiceLogin.aspx?e=a 

yea, that is not good!  Please look into the bank that Fry's uses, First electronic Bank Of Utah, They are widely reviewed all over the web and they do not have one review that is above one star. My personal experience with them was less than a one star. The overall experience with them alone made me not ever want to deal with Frys Again! Boo To First Electronic Bank Of Utah!!Just sloppy messy mexican food - nothing specialDO NOT LET THEM PUT YOU IN ROMAN TOWER!  Unless, of course, sleeping in an ashtray sounds appealing.  

The rooms are tired.  Not clean... and overwhelmingly smell of cigarette smoke.

I am so sad of this pathetic experience... I anticipated I would like Ceasars.I visited Jaycee Dog Park recently -- never again.

It's a tiny park, not much bigger than the backyards in the area. It was very nicely shaded, with a building on the west side, and many trees. Staying out of the sun here is not a problem, nor is finding a seat on one of its many benches. It also has a double gate, and plenty of parking close to the entrance. The city also supplies poop bags...

...but apparently no one has ever used one. When I had five dogs, my backyard didn't accumulate this much poop in a month. It's disgusting, and a health hazard. Who are the people who don't clean up after their dogs?

Other issues: The grass is excessively long in the areas where it grows. It looks like a weed garden in some sections. The ground is covered with trash, mainly of the bottles/cigarettes kind, along with candy wrappers.

Beware, small dog owners. There is a gap large enough for a 15-20 lb. dog to pass between the gate and the fence on each of the two gates in the entrance. It would not be difficult for them to escape to the main park.Do you enjoy being served excuses instead of food and drink? How about iced tea that looks like it was made with powdered milk? Are you a fan of waiting 45 minutes for a round of drinks in barely crowded sports bars? 

If you answered yes to any of the above, you should go to Blondies and get the hell away from me. 

Our party of seven had an hour plus to kill before flying the F out of Sin City and (poorly) decided on Blondies for some much needed snacks and okay, fine, a drink/pitcher. Stop judging. 

We sat down and after 15 minutes or so, not one server had come by. How do you miss a group of 7 when your restaurant is the exact opposite of busy? Were we wearing One Rings? I walked up to the group (yes, GROUP) of servers and one of them explained, "Sorry, we're slammed." Girl, do you need a dictionary? Slammed is not the word you need - there are maybe 25 people in this piece. 

I'm going to cut this short because I'm getting all insanity wolf thinking about this place, but avoid Blondies at all costs unless you feel like you need to punish yourself for your poor life decisions during your trip. It's the kind of place where you wouldn't be that surprised if you bit into a deep fried rat. And if you look at all the other reviews that are over one star, assume it's because these people were blackout drunk because there is no way in actual hell this place is "CRACKIN'" or "pretty fun." It is "fucking terrible" and "should not exist."Came here while a robbery was in progress.

The cops asked me why on earth I would have come here alone (at 9pm, no less)

Avoid at all costs, unless you need more excitement in your life.Pros: 
Polite front desk attendees
Polite cleaning staff
Very nicely folded beds, not a wrinkle on those sheets, you could bounce a quarter off them! 
Clean bathrooms

Cons:
BEDBUGS! 


I "Pricelined" this room because I had to be in Scottsdale for work this weekend and the hotel prices are ridiculous in this town.

Upon arriving, it was quickly apparent that it is a re-done Motel 6-type place. I cannot imagine how many hundreds of thousands of dollars were used on redoing this place. Kudos on that aspect.  The checkin process was great, everybody was super nice. Anyone I ever saw working the front desk was someone who looked like they just graduated high school. 

My room (262) was very clean, bed was made exquisitely, countertops wiped clean, mirrors clean, no stray hairs in the tub (my pet peeve) and clean toilet. Great job, housekeeping staff!! 

The thermostat gave me two options- heating or cooling. Of course, I needed cooling, and it wouldnt let me go below 70-  both heat and cool had a pre-set temperature, so there wasn't a 'pick a temperature that works for you'; either the heat/air was on or off. 

Upon waking up the next morning at 6, I got out of bed and immediately saw a big bedbug on my pillow by where my head was! YIKES! This guy was about 3/4 the size of my pinky nail- and that is a decent size for a bedbug. I took pictures and videos.  There were bites on my neck and arms. (I didnt see the dozens of bites on my legs until later).. I then called Priceline's help desk because I know when going through there all sales are final: Non refundable and Non transferrable. Sure enough, they couldnt do anything for me, but they did give me credit on the next purchase I made through them. Fair enough. 


I go to the front desk and the young man who had been there all night since 11 was nice and helpful, he called his manager at home since it wasn't letting him switch rooms. Since it was pre-paid through a third party site, refund was not an option (Note: I would have LOVED to left this place and never returned, but since I couldnt get my money back on the 2nd night I had coming and didn't have the money for a room at a different hotel- it was either take a different room or sleep in my car)

I had to leave and go to the meetings, and at around 4pm, I was given a call saying that I had my new room. No clue what the hold up was. I get to the hotel and there is no manager there to speak with, but the front desk was super kind and polite in giving me the new room. I couldnt yell at the front desk help (again, kids that looked about 20)- it wasn't their fault directly that I was bitten. The young lady said somebody has sprayed the room I had stayed in and housekeeping did a thorough job cleaning it. (It takes more than that to get rid of them, but motel staff will have to deal with that )

The second night in the new room was fine. The room appeared just as clean as the last one. I had no new bites from the second night, I made sure to look very carefully before going to bed. Perhaps the bedbugs came from a previous guest and they were confined to that room, I will never know, I don't care. I just know I was bitten many, many times. 

 Checkout procedure was very quick and very polite, no word from a manager still. 

I will never go back, and will never recommend it. Lots of work has gone into making this place better than a Motel 6-type-place, but it is sort of like putting lipstick on a pig if the underlying issues aren't taken care of.I was very disappointed in the haircut I received recently. After giving my stylist explicit instruction on what parts of my hair to cut, she cut my hair way too short all over. I tried to control what she was doing, but she went on cutting anyway.All I was interested in was some more information on something I had purchased!
I bought a stainless steel pan for 79.95 at this location. I was very excited about it as i had been wanting one for a while and just moved into a new house after recently being married. The pan I purchased had a white sticker on the bottom of the pan that said made in china which was a little disappointing but not surprising but the main problem was the pan really really wobbled. It did not lie flat on any surface. This wasn't minor but major as I asked 3 other people's opinion on it. They're response was for 79.9, it should be brand new and not wobble. 
I took it back a few days later and was helped only by one employee because apparently all the rest were either to busy to be bothered or had something better to do like...  Nothing. 
I believe it was a newer lady Laurie or  Lauren that helped me because she was outstanding. She really actually WANTED to help me and gave me excellent advice.  She was obviously new and was working with what seemed to be 2 other people of authority as they threw their snootiness around. No other customers to help and neither of them would help her and when she asked them, the guy came over all grumpy and wouldn't even acknowledge my existence. ( my only thought is he's annoyed I may be returning something)( either way making me feel like crap).
Walking into your store with the pan, I, myself, didn't know what I was gonna do. 1) return pan 2) exchange pan or 3) upgrade to a better quality pan for More Money! 
I agreed to exchange it only because Laurie was so sweet and nice. 
It's been 3 days now and I'm sitting here doing this yelp review because I'm still so insulted. 
I am a regional manager for another store in this mall and I would fire my employee on the spot if they ever treated someone like this. I'm sick of giving excellent service and receiving horrible service. Laurie, please relocate for your own well being.  How could you work with these other people you're obviously above? Good luck!I been in the QC area for about 5 months, and seem a COX techs 3 times so far. Their service is down a lot compare to Comcast which I had for 5 years on the east coast and only seen their techs twice 

Cox Internet = Good when it's working 

Cox cable = THE CRAPPIEST SERVICE EVER.

They wont fix anything, they wont help you out, their channels are constantly pix-elated.  

You pay for HD service.  You *HAVE* to rent a cable box from them to get HD.  

SOMEONE PLEASE END THEIR MONOPOLY.  

Ugh cox cable sucks so bad.

I think it time to kick COX to the curb and get SAT TVAs a treat for my sweet pea we stopped here on the way to cub scouts last week.  Well, I won't lie.  I was also craving a garden burger.  We got there and the man taking our order was very nice but while there was only one other customer in the restaurant, it took us 18 minutes to get our food.  That's just ridiculous.Me and my roommates have been coming to this place for over a year. We usually enjoy the food but have never really enjoyed the service. Usually when we have eaten here we get it to go because the service is poor. 
This time I drove nearly 20 minutes to come pick up the food, I picked it up I brought it home and we started eating. Then a fly was discovered in one of the dishes. We called and said we were going to want a refund the lady we spoke to was not going to give us a refund unless we brought the food in. I didn't mind that but she was argumentative over the phone. I packed up the food, and drove all the way back and brought it into the store. I walked in, and I was quiet, she came up to me and said "let me see" she took the bag I had and just started walking towards the back. Then she went into the kitchen, I could hear her talking but since I do not speak Chinese I did not know what she was saying. She then came out and the first thing out of her mouth was, "You ate a lot of the food so I am not going to give you all your money back". I said, I had no problem with that but I do have a problem with the attitude you are giving me. I said, "I understand things like this happen but you have not been courteous to us at all". 
She gave us half of our money back in cash. She said people try to fake things like this all the time. I said I know, I use to work in a restaurant, I know how people try to scam things. I told her thank you and walked out. 

I understand them wanting to see the food and making sure we were not lying but there was never one time she said I'm sorry for the inconvenience or anything like that. Not even sorry there was a little insect in your dinner. 
This really sucks because no matter how good the food usually is, the rudeness and dis-respectfulness will keep me from coming back.... Ever.Known as the best or perhaps just least-worst of dineries in teeny tiny Florence.  My friend liked their food just fine. my salmon filet was absolutely the WORST salmon I have ever been served, and overall about as bad a restaurant meal as I've ever eaten.  Tough, cold, tasteless.  OK OK I should have sent it back... maybe ask if the chef/cook could handle skippy on wonder bread ?Crap hole.............
I drove up  to this place from west Ahwatukee, looking for miniatures and not knowing anything about this RPG stuff. The kid behind the counter was as helpful as a brain dead chimp. There was absolutely no organization of the game pieces it's just thrown all over. I should have stayed home and not wasted my gas or time. Would have been faster and cheaper to get what I needed online. 
Would give it zero stars if I could.Horrible place! Way too expensive. And way too tiny of portions. It's a sit down restaurant that's not tailored for take out. They charge double than most fast good Mexican restaurants but they're 3 times as expensive. Just a horrible place. I hope these people either lower their prices, give bigger portions, or go out of business. You choose...Hasn't been the same since they changed their chips over five years ago.   Thought we would give them another shot in Queen Creek.    My Son ordered bean and cheese  burrito. It was served wrong.   Needles to say we sent it back for a reorder.   Came home and my son can't get off the toilet.They service the pool in the house we lease.  They replaced a previous, incompetent, pool company.  They originally came out to do warranty work on the pump, and they talked themselves up so much we hired them to do our weekly maintenance.  I now know it was ALL talk.  They are very inconsistent in their service.  This is the second time now that we can't even use the pool because it's all messed up!  And then they don't show up to make the repairs.  Horrible!My friend [who has celiac's disease] took me here for lunch.  I have a daughter who is gluten-free so I am always willing to try any place that serves gluten free, as I can sympathize with how difficult it is to find decent food to accomodate this food allergy. 

This however, was not decent, it was downright gross.

First let me say that it is VERY expensive.  I had a lunch special:  1 slice of pizza, a caesar salad, and water - $9.50.  She had a pasta lunch special:  gluten free pasta and a side salad:  $13.50.  Holy cow.

The pizza slice was not gluten free and it tasted awful anyway.  It's really hard to screw up regular pizza crust [because it has literally like 4 ingredients], but the crust had an odd flavor to it.  The pizza was covered in greasy cheese, and the sauce tasted like it was loaded with sugar.  The salad was equally disappointing:  the lettuce had brown edges [aka OLD] and was drenched in nothing that resembled a classic caesar dressing.  

The service was ok to average.  It took the waitress at least 15 minutes to process my credit card....
This is honestly probably one of the worst restaurants I have been to in a while.They just got done with their Kitchen remodel.  Food is really expensive.  It is drive through food with sit down prices and tip.  Food was not season well, portions were ok, they wouldn't  honor my full entertainment book 20% discount.  Really!!!  In this market you need all the friends you can get.  Not a good experience.  Won't be back.  I would stick with an Eribertos or the like.Worst service ever.  Tried to pick up our order that we phoned in.  Waited in the carry out line and cashier kept taking other people's orders that were eating in.  After 5 minutes we cut in and asked if we were in the right line,  as we were being ignored. She said she would be right with us.  She proceeded to ring the next 3 people up in line when I asked again if we could be helped.  She called someone to the front who proceeded to take new orders.  5 more minutes passed and I flag down another employee working behind the counter to let them know of the service and to cancel our order that has been sitting on top of the oven for the past 15 minutes.  The only thing given was a quick I'm sorry.  There are a lot of pizza places in town.  I just ordered from Dominos.  Should have done that in the first place.Went in for a routine appointment as a new customer to have my Dog's vaccs updated. (2) of them.  I arrived 20 minutes early as I was new, and provided them the documentation for the dog I had with me, as well as my 3 other pets.

I note that I had additional pets for a reason - I came in early, and showed that I was a customer with a lot of potential business to offer them.  

An hour later, 40 minutes after my appointment was scheduled, I finally saw the vet.  I use the word saw cautiously, because she was in the room a matter of two minutes.  She did a brief examination (which I did not ask for - all that I wanted was the updated vaccinations) and she then proceeded to peddle more additional (and costly!) services that I did not require, desire, or need in any way.

$20 to trim my dog's nails.  Seriously?  ~$100 in other 'precautionary' subscriptions for heart worm, etc. after I specifically told them I had handled that separately with my previous vet.  (I'm new to the area)

After the doctor left the room, a tech. came in and wanted me to sign a bill of services, including the heart worm medication I told the doctor - explicitly - that I was not interested in them.  

After they provided me with the correct bill - the tech. came back in and administered the shots.  The vet never came back in to thank me for my business, or apologize for keeping me waiting 40 minutes past my appointment time.  

Just not the level of professionalism I'm used to - call me crazy.  But if I was them, seeing a new customer with four pets walking through my door, I'd do a lot more to make sure things went well.  And I definitely wouldn't try to hit him up for outrageously overpriced services.  

$20 to clip my dogs nails is really just silly, I laughed when I saw that.  No thanks, I'll bring my business elsewhere.Poor customer support. Very slow response time. I'm still waiting for my business cards I've ordered over a month ago!wow biggest scam artists in the valley, if a rep for this company walks into your business swiftly walk him out, they are the best in the business for a reason they know how to price gouge and get customers with b/s promotions. listen to this  my friendly sales rep Angelo espisito ( who also has a specialty item distribution business on the side with his wife) gets my business from sysco by telling me that if i go exclusive with them for 8 weeks they will take the average of sales over the 8 weeks and give me a check for  the amount of one week, wow great deal......not!!!!!  at week 7 and 4 days into the promotion i get a notice from the company that they noticed one of the weeks we were only @ 80% of our ordering through them and because of that they will not be able to honor the contract, big surprise.  So after  $45,000 plus another 5,000 to sue them i got about 30,000 in product, and yah!! my one week rebate, U.S foods and Sysco do business with competitive pricing and great service not smoke and mirrorscame to Arizona for a relaxing weekend and ended up at this HORRIBLE place. First i ordered a custom pizza and the ingredients were horrible blank no taste and the sauce taste like nothing. I paid $20 for a small pizza not worth it. But it does not stop there. There was a married couple were the girl wanted the whole place to listen into her personal life with father in-law issues! A man approached her to pipe down and that started an on going fight from verbal into mild physical! yet this went on for 15 or more minutes and the manager or workers said nothing from the beginning to these people to at least get them out. Never again will i make the mistake of coming here! Were was the boss?Poor service. Talk you into getting car vacuum, clean windows for extra. Car not vacuumed or windows cleaned. Shisters!  Don't go there.from personal experience Mayo clinic as well as the medical staff do not recognize your right to autonomy. They will in fact force procedures on you against your will, as was my case. Had I not been as naive as when this was done to me I would have sought the council of a attorney. As it is though I was abused traumatized, and in my opinion "raped" they were forced to offer me a small settlement Don' t go to this (my opinion) barbaric hospital!I don't care if the restaurant did smell like a hospice and the decor is like a cheesy buffet in Reno, Nevada, but I do care about the food. First off, I went in this place saying it's a Thai spot in Surprise but the white rice was undercooked...HOW DO YOU MESS UP ON JASMINE RICE. I'm done...Brought my 4 year old daughter here. They scratched her 100 times s she cried. I had too tell them to stop. My fault that i didn't know what to expect and let out go too long. There fault that they are supposed to center their practice around children and have no compassion our common sense when dealing with children. I think perhaps they should stop taking new patients if they are so busy they can't take the time to care for there patience.Don't have anything nice to say about this practice. We have been with them for over 2 years and the service and quality of people that work there has decreased tremendously. 

Front of the house staff are incredibly rude, unhelpful and uncaring. You shouldn't really be working in an office that deals with parents and children all day if you aren't going to be able to put on a smile and be nice!!The staff here politely ignores you. 

I went in for lunch one day with my father and we hadnt received our meal in over an hour. We had to get the waitress or hostess attention for everything, drinks, apps we had ordered (seems that they forgot), bread........it took an hour. You figured theyd bring this stuff out as a courtesy. 

The manager was the worst. She trolled the restaurant the whole time and when she saw that we were looking to her to come ask how we were doing, she would make eye contact and keep walking. I saw her escape into the bar several times. Maybe it was to avoid having to look the patrons in the face. 

Either way, the food was average, the wait was terrible and they werent that busy.I just went here today all the way from anthem to get my brand new high end car washed 

this place is a JOKE & a RIPOFF! 

the guy who was there when I pulled up obviously thinks I'm an idiot!!!

I don't want $10k brand new rims & tires on the old rickety track they put it on 

I asked how much for a hand wash not on the track he replied $30+ and told me that was a "great deal" because "everyone else charges $50 !!!!" 

REALLY???!!! $50 to wash the outside of your car only? 
WOW 
I was born, but it wasn't yesterday 

this guy obviously thought I was an idiot and as a result this place just lost out on our potential weekly business for 2 brand new cars! 

ASSHOLEStarted the experience walking in and being told by the cashier that they were out of the onion rings as a side option.  Whatever; I ordered my L1 combo: 2fish/6shrimp.  Proceed over to get my beverage.  The condiment stand was filthy, the cocktail sauce pump and napkin dispensers were removed, leaving large holes.  The soda machine was out of diet root beer.  This is an A&W/mixed use venue...root beer is their trademark!  It was orange coming out and tasted like the orange soda.  I informed the cashier as he was handing me my order.  He said "no, it's just out".  So since I absolutely hate and cringe over diet Pepsi (the worst flavor in the world) I asked for some sweet & low packets for some fresh brewed iced tea...even pointing at the tea urns on the front counter.  He returns with Sweet & Sour packets.  I had to explain that I wanted the small pink paper packets of sugar-free sugar to sweeten up iced tea.  He responded with "OH, yeah, sorry, we're out of that too".  Upon seating at my table I noticed that my plate only had 1 piece of fish and the 6 shrimp.  Honestly, at this point I didn't even go back up since the math of counting up to 2 must be eluding them.  This was just a terrible visit.  I have been here several times before...never had a "great" visit...they are either mediocre or something such as this (this is my 3rd terrible encounter).I heard about this restaurant from a friend and thought I would give it a try the other morning. I walked in and was greeted immediately and walked to my table. A gentlemen stopped and asked if I would like some coffee. He brought me the coffee and poured me a cup and left. The coffee tasted bitter and cold and just plain awful. I looked around and waited....and waited...and waited...someone finally stopped and I asked if I could speak to a manager and she said she would send coco? right over. The young lady walked to what i presume was the manager. the lady was texting on her phone and never once looked away from it to even acknowledge the server speaking to her. When she walked away the manager still stood in the corner on her phone for what seemed like forever....i chose to get up and leave because i felt extremely dismissed and won't be back #feelingfrustratedWaited 45 minutes for the shuttle.  When we called to find out where the shuttle was, the operator didn't even apologize; she just told us another 15 minutes. When we finally got in the shuttle, the driver went through two red lights. :-(I have been coming to the las vegas location since they opened and I think today was my last visit.  Its mothers day and we went to eat dinner early but wanted dessert from joes's, its become one of our las vegas tradtions.  So being mothers day I called ahead of time and asked if I needed reservations tonight just for dessert.  I spoke with not one but TWO employees on the phone and both confirmed that I would be ok coming in with my party of 5.  We make the trek on foot with 2 people in wheelchairs from paris hotel and casino where we are staying.  And then they tell us at the door that we cannot get seated because we're only having dessert and they are still busy. But that we can take it to go.  Sooo frustrated that our mothers day celebration had to end like this.  The seating host easily dismissed us and I didn't appreciate the lack of customer service.Egads!!  As locals, we go to Joe's 5-6 times a year for pleasure and business, usually the food and service is outstanding, last night, for Christmas dinner, it was horrendous on both fronts. We made reservations about a week in advance.  They called us that morning to confirm - then told us they could not find our reservation on the phone.  When we arrived, they told my wife they could not find the reservation, when my wife offered to show the confirmation number on her mobile phone the host says "let me do my job."  After 3 minutes he then asks to see the confirmation number.  We finally get seated, and it gets worse.

We order dinner, drinks, and appetizers.  25 minutes after taking our order we are informed that the whole maine lobster is no longer available, we had ordered 2.  We then re-order. lobster tails and chiliean sea bass.  When the food arrives, our side dishes are missing.  One lobster tail was over-cooked, one under-cooked, and the seabass was bland.  The sides finally arrived more than mid-way through our entrees - the waitress apologizes, and says the sides will be taken off the bill.  We had also asked for refills on the bread - three times, which finally arrives when the plates are cleared.

The manager comes over, and acts annoyed that he has to apologize for the service and food.  Naturally when the bill comes, the sides are not taken off.   We were so bothered by the lack of concern, we paid the bill and left.  It will be awhile before we return to Joe's.This might have been the worst Thai food I've ever eaten. I thought I'd be safe by ordering a salad and satay chicken delivery. I literally took one bite of chicken spit it out and threw the whole thing away. I would not recommend the Thai - haven't tried the Chinese dishes definitely won'tThe woman answering the phones is horrible. She can not speak clearly, and is rude. She hung up on me twice. Also my order took well over an hour to be delivered to my house and I am right down the street. It's a joke.This is the second time that we've stayed at the Trump. It's been a few years but I have to say that my second time will be the last time.  

Upon arrival, we got into our room quickly. As we settled in, we turned the TV on. Or tried....it didn't work. We called downstairs and within 10 minutes, maintenance came up. It was a quick fix with a circuit breaker issue and he was on his way. 

We then went downstairs for a drink in the lounge. When we got back upstairs, we then saw that the garbage can near the desk had not been emptied. There were dirty q-tips on the floor near the garbage can, and it was filled with empty coffee creamer, orange seeds, etc. After inspecting the rest of the room, I realized that the bathroom tub wasn't all that clean. Not feeling all that confident that the room had been thoroughly cleaned, I called down and asked for a room switch. 

I was told that they would send somebody up with new room keys and escort us to our new room. That took about 25 minutes. Now we were on a time crunch to get showered and ready for dinner. 

Upon entering the new room, my husband tried the TV. Guess what? It didn't work! Surprise, surprise. At this point, we had to leave for dinner so we called down to let them know that the second room's TV didn't work either. 

In a rush to make our reservation, we left the room and realized we forgot something, so we ran back to the room. The new keys didn't work! 

Sigh....we decided to wait until we got home later that evening to deal with it. 

Later we got back to the hotel and talked with the front desk. We explained our situation and politely expressed our annoyances with what had happened since check-in. The person working the desk said he needed to check on something for us. When he came back, he told us that he "wanted us to go and settle in our room and enjoy yourselves" and that he would be "sending a bottle of champagne up to the room for you." But he kept repeating that he wanted us to "enjoy ourselves", which was a little creepy to me.   

It was 2:30 am by the time we got to the room and I was ready to go to bed. We waited and waited and finally I fell asleep. About 40 minutes later, the bottle of champagne was brought up to our room. 

As the weekend progressed, there were more things that were disappointing. The second TV in the bathroom never worked, there was a light out in the bathroom and the toilet barely flushed. However, we just let it go because we thought we'd just get another bottle of champagne...whoo-hoo! I'm not even a champagne drinker, so that "reward" meant nothing for the inconvenience. 

We've stayed at several wonderful 5 star hotels in Vegas....the Wynn, Mandarin Oriental, Cosmopolitan...and the Trump has a long way to go if it wants to be compared to these hotels! 

Aside from the decent bed/pillows, there wasn't much that excited me about this time at the Trump. I think we'll pass next time.Really very disappointing experience. 

 I got to the hotel at noon. They wanted $28 extra to check in before 3pm.  I refused, so I walked around the mall for a few hours then came back to check in.  No big deal, rules are rules.

The casino doesn't look like anything Hollywood.  It looks more like an abandoned set from a Beck video.  Leftover 70s glam, with the gold and rounded rectangles.  

They only offer free internet for only one device.  So I can use Wi-Fi on my laptop, but not on my phone or iPad.  Even McDonalds has free WiFi, I don't know why a big fancy hotel wouldn't.

They don't have any premium channels on TV.  Just Spike and Comedy Central.  This is Vegas, so you shouldn't be watching TV anyway, but I'm here on business so I am not going to be out partying.  I've stayed in dicey-ass weird motels in New Mexico that had better cable than Planet Hollywood.

But all of that was fine.  Cheap room, crappy amenities, right?  Well....

As I walked up to my room, the cleaning ladies were still in the hallway.  There was an empty 12 pack box of Pabst sitting in front of my door.  Nice, huh?  A sign of things to come.

Both the sheets and the comforter were stained.  There were huge 4" long orange dog hairs all over the room including on top of the comforter, and there was a weird Velcro mustache or something rolled up and thrown in the corner.  When I called to ask for new bedding, I got some attitude, and a comment that if there are extra people staying in the room they're going to charge me extra.  Nope, just me.  I didn't want EXTRA blankets, just CLEAN ones.  Just one person who doesn't want to sleep on top of someone else's stains and dog hair.  

I've stayed at some really gross dive motels that were cleaner than this dump.  Pick a different hotel.  Do yourself a favor.I almost threw up the minute I walked in this dive.  What a pit.  the smell of "fish gone wrong" was too overwhelming for me.  And the place was DIRTY.  Seafood and dirt DO NOT mix.

The service was awful if you are not Asia....seriously....all the Asian folks were taken care of immediately.

We ordered, then I made the mistake of going to the bathroom to wash my hands before I ate.  OMG.  I'm sure I picked up masses of germs just walking in that hole.

Food came, and I swear we didn't eat it.  The shrimp were so tough it was impossible to really eat.  The crawfish?  It's like someone said below...it was like fish bait!  SO dirty and what really pissed me off was that I asked for medium and instead got the spiciest hottest juice ever.  When I asked if it was correct, she just shrugged her shoulders.  Wow.

Disgusting, will never eat here again and will never suggest it to anyone who doesn't want to get sick.Incredibly poor experience! I had two simple dishes, that were executed very poorly. The clam chowder, was under seasoned, and a complete puddle of mush. It was truly disappointed; due to reading great reviews about it i had perviously looked forward to it. Then the oysters Rockefeller, not only under seasoned as well but completely flavorless. The bar top server could careless about his job, never asked how the meal was. And passed up cashing my tab out 7 times; as he walked by staring at my credit card each time. But the real disappointment was the food. So bad that I decided to order my entree elsewhere. The total experience was enough to leave the casino entirely. Save your self the disappointment and money; you will find better food at a soup kitchen.Fast food quality, with high end restaurant wait times.

My wife and I live near downtown Phoenix/Mid Town, so when people give us restaurant recommendations to trendy spots, we love to check them out. This place was horrendous. First of all the wait, when we went, there was a line, we later discovered the reason for the line was they had one person on the register. Even though the owner was out shaking hands and getting ready to leave, the second register was never opened. By the time we got to order, 50 minutes had passed and we got to the point of where "maybe" the food quality may make up for the horrible wait.

Nope! It took about 5 minutes to actually get our food, so the issue wasn't food prep, it was just the horrible logistics of this business. I ordered a farm burger, medium with bacon and cheese. What I got resembled something that had been marinated in grease for about 12 years then under cooked and served on a delicious bun, but 2 minutes into the meal the bun resembled a soggy rag. The fries had a weird taste to them, I ended up not eating my meal. My wife got through about half of her burger before she complained about the greasiness.

I put the burger quality on par with an in-and-out, smash burger, five guys style burger. However, would you wait 30+ minutes for one of those? No, so I will never return here and I will chalk up all of the recommendations for this place to, suburb folks that have never experienced real dining.Clearly ordered two pizzas (6 people around to confirm) - phone service was lame - repeated order multiple times.  Deliver arrives with one pizza at $27 and has no clue of other order.  Proceeds to charge $27 for one pizza with no solution for the second pizza.  Clueless staff.My boyfriend and I ate there lastnight, now  we both have food poisoning!! Never will we go back!The service was lousy. Our waitress didn't bring out our drinks for 20 minutes and we had to flag her down just to get those drinks. We were essentially ignored the entire night as she  never checked up on us, or refilled our drinks and the restaurant was not busy so there was no excuse for her lousy service. We had to flag her down again just to get our bill. The restaurant wasn't busy which was strange because this was right before an event. The food wasn't bad but it wasn't good. It had no flavor. If you are seeking simple bar food, I would recommend Jacksons on Third and Cooperstown over this place. I would even recommend the Matador restaurant next door. We won't be coming back and I don't recommend this placeTotal rip off.  The check was 80.00 for two ffillet burgers and two glasses of wine plus fries are an extra charge. Never going back.  The meat was horrible, a regular burger would have had some taste to it,greasy melted cheese and greasy overcooked.(not carmelized, there is a difference).  In and out has better food I recommend going there.My sister and I just ate there a few hours ago. Only because we were so hungry after watching a concert. 

We waited patiently for our food since they were so busy. My sister ordered grilled chicken sandwich $14.00 with fries and I had ordered duck soup for $11.00... I thought the price for the sandwich was a bit too expensive, especially from a cafe style restaurant.
When we got our food, my sister complained about the size of the chicken. The waiter said it was a 5 ounce...humm... more like a 3 ounce to me! It was so small it didn't even cover the bottom of the bread. (see photo attached to my review)
It looked ridiculous. I couldn't stop laughing!!!! I have never seen anything like it. And to think they would have the audacity to serve that type of low-quality food to a guest and ask for $14.00 in return? For a chicken sandwich? Wow! I would be so embarrass if I was in charge of that restaurant . 
My sister spoke to the manager. He apologized and told her that he would give us 20% off the entire bill. What about 60% more chicken in that sandwich? Lol! We agreed to the 20%. The last thing you ever want to do is to send the food back to the back kitchen.  Needless to say, we will not be eating there ever again. Even if we were starving. 
At least our waiter was nice, attentive, and very apologetic. I still left him a 25% tip. 
It's not his fault that the restaurant he works for is CHEAP when it comes to quantity and quality of food. :(We travel a lot and are wintering here for several months . This is the worst wal mart we have been in from carts all over the parking lot.shelves needing stocking and loooong lines at cashier stand. Wal mart is known for it low pay and you can see it here with the attitude of the help. This joint is only a mile away but we will not be shopping here in the future,,,,,On 2/17/13, I took my family here to eat. This would have been my first visit here. Upon our arrival, I knew there was going to be a long wait because it was Sunday afternoon. However, after 5 minutes of standing in line we were asked to leave without a valid reason. One worker said they were running out of food but another said their bathrooms were not working. When I was standing in line I noticed their soda machine was leaking all over the floor near the front of the line. There were paper towels covering it up. Also, for the little bit of time we were in line, the line barely moved. I wont' be going back to this location!No more access to United Club with AMEX Platinum. I hate the fact United has taken over Continental.UPDATE: 6/4/2014 - This place is horrible.  They started super, then totally fell off.  I am a busy mom of two and didn't monitor as closely as I should have as far as their timing with visits. I paid for bi-weekly service.  It was moving to every two weeks and I would forget to call them to find out what was going on with my busy days.  I finally added up how many times this was happening and they totally owe me at least 1 month refund.  I called and left them a message about the missed service, and wanting to stop the service.  They NEVER called back, never refunded my money AND took out yet another payment for the service they are not performing.  ORIGINAL POST:  Sandy at Pet Butler is A-MAZE-ING! I submitted a request late one evening and she called me FIRST thing the next morning.  We discussed services and then she told me about the deal that was online with Yelp for a discount.  I signed up and we arranged my first service.  The service date was less than a week from the time I purchased.  They did a fantastic job cleaning up the yard and were are very customer service oriented.  The value is super!  You HAVE to give them a try.  You too will be pleased.  Thank you Sandy and Pet Butler!Horrible club. Horrible layout. Dance floor is small and overcrowded. Hip hop planned ALL night. Gross! Good thing my party and I got in free. We left just after being there for one hour. Found a lounge at the mandalay bay hotel that was 100%  better. Next time my time will not be wasted at LAX that's for damn sure.Nice selection of plants that are pricey.  I chose to purchase 2 ocotillos for 59.99 apiece last year from them, because I was told that they were guaranteed.  One did not survive and when I called to see about exchanging for a new one, I was told there was no guarantee on the plants they sell.  Be forewarned, before you purchase from this company, there was nothing on the receipt about whether their plants are guaranteed or not.  For the prices they charge compared to other more convenient nurseries, they should have better customer service than what I received. Don't waste your time driving all the way out to the boonies when they will tell you whatever you want to hear to make a sale, then tell you otherwise when you aren't satisfied with their product.It smells like cigarettes. If I didn't know better I'd think I was at the Four Queens.Their menu says they're open till 11, but actually they won't take your pick-up order (regardless of size) after 10:30. So, say you call at 10:34, you're outa luck. Maybe the food is good, but it's hard to tell when they refuse to take an order for it. Kind of a pathetic way to handle yourselves in regards to service.Service was horrid!  When a party calls with a reservation and you confirm said reservation they should not be told to either sit outside or wait for an additional thirty minutes before being seated.  (This is after a 20 minute wait past the reservation already.)  All food was either overcooked or undercooked.  Some meals were not even brought out until after other party members had already fisnished.  Trying to flag down a waiter for a refill on a water was nearly impossiable.  I realize that it is not the wait staff's fault but rather poor management.  In the future I will stick to a less pricey better tasting cajun option.I was so excited to come here, especially after seeing their menu and pictures online. 

I went with my partner and some friends to see the Samba Project, which was live music on the patio.

First of all, you had to pay $5 IN ADDITION to food and drink in order to listen to the music. Keep in mind the food starts at $10 a person, so with drinks, you're now paying at least $20 to listen to good, albeit not great music.

I walk with a cane. Our friends had gotten their earlier, and were waiting for the table, and my partner and I waited with them. Standing. For over 30 minutes. No one offered us a seat, and after half an hour, I had shooting pain, so I went to ask the hostess a) how long it would be, and b) if they had a seat. I started talking to her, and explained I was disabled, and she actually said "hold on a bit" and took a party of 2 to go stand and wait. I told her I was just going sit in my car and wait then, and she just shook her head and walked off. What an incredibly NON-disability friendly place.

Finally (having got there at 8), we got sat a little before 9.  Our waiter didn't come for another 15 minutes, and our drinks? around 9:30 or so. My partner and I ordered iced tea, expecting regular iced tea. Instead, it was sickly sweet and peach flavored. Neither of us liked it. When the server asked how my tea was, I let him know I didn't like peach. He never asked if I wanted something else, even when I asked for a glass of water and moved my tea to the middle, and when my partner said no to tea refills, even before the food showed up. Finally, I just told him to take away my glass. The only positive? He took it off the check (but not my partner's).

The food? Let's see, until almost 9:45, we only had one menu. Finally, we asked for more, and got them, and were ready to order at about 9:50.  Again, we had to wait a huge amount of time to order, and then the food took almost a full hour to come out...for 3 paninis and an order of bruschetta.  I mean, did they bake the bread fresh? It was ok. Good, but not great. I'd say Postino's was better by far on both the paninis and the bruschetta. 

Then of course, it took us forever to get the check...which then came back in wet check holders, etc.

The atmosphere? Lovely. I loved the wall of candle and the couch we were on was super comfy. But it shouldn't take almost 3 hours to get something to eat (we were sat around 9, left at 10 till midnight), and the lack of caring from the hostess and service from the server earned this restaurant/wine bar one star...the second ever 1 star I've given.Hometown Buffet is horrible, but this buffet is even worse. Food was gross, cold and way over priced. The absolute worst part was as we finished our meal we saw a lady clearing and wiping dirty tables. She then took the dirty rag she used to wipe the table, and use that same dirty rag to wipe silverware for the table for the next guests to use. Complained to Luxor and they seem to care less, not even willing to comp us for the money we spent on a meal we ate with forks wiped from a dirty rag. Go to McDonalds, go anywhere else other than here.Horrible and very slow service and they messed up my order. They were not crowed either. Ordered a Cobb Salad and server brought me the wrong salad then tried to ask like it was right- left off bacon, cranberries, and walnuts. Had shredded cheese on it which it doesn't come with. Wrong dressing on the side! Server wanted to bring me bacon, walnuts, and cranberries to add to my own salad. Why not bring me the lettuce too. Why not have me go in the kitchen and make my own! Will not be back to this one again!This is a cautionary tale. This hotel occasionally offer Groupons and you should UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES buy a Groupon to stay here. I bought a Groupon for a one-night stay back in 2011. I never got a chance to use it before it expired, but I figured it was no big deal because (like most Groupons) it clearly says in the fine print "The amount paid for this voucher ($89) with Radisson Fort McDowell Resort NEVER EXPIRES." (emphasis from Groupon, not added by me... you can also see Groupon's FAQ web site, where the answer to the very first question states that you can *always* redeem Groupons for the amount paid). 

Several months after the expiration date, I called the hotel hoping to use what I believed was an $89 credit I already had toward the price of a full-priced room. To be clear, I was not asking for any additional discount and was just trying to book a one-night stay, at regular price, on a weeknight in the middle of summer. It's not like I'm asking for much. Instead, I got a major run-around from booking agents, had to call twice, talked to two different reservation agents who couldn't tell me whether or not I could redeem the Groupon, and had to leave a message with someone on a special Groupon line. Today, I had a call back from someone identifying themselves as a "manager." I was told that I could not use the $89 I had already paid as a credit. When I confronted her about the fine print on the Groupon and my past experiences redeeming expired Groupons for face value, she told me: "I don't know why it says that. That isn't our policy, you should contact Groupon and see what they have to say." 

This hotel wasted a good deal of my time in failed attempts to make a reservation and made no attempt to keep my business by offering me a lesser credit or an alternative discount for my troubles. Worse, they do not honor the commitments made on their discount offers. I guess it's a buyer beware situation, but the general public should be made aware that the Radisson Ft. McDowell does not adhere to the stipulations in the fine print on Groupons. You had best bet that I'll be contacting Groupon to complain about this, and Radisson management can expect a letter from me as well.Maybe I'm wrong, you decide.  I needed toner for my Canon printer.  Went online and OfficeMax had the best price, $67.99.  Went to the store and the shelf said $73.99.  I went to their site on my phone and verified the lower price.

When I checked out, the price scanned at $71.99.  I showed the cashier my phone for $67.99 and he called the manager for approval.  The manager approved and said to me, "Our prices aren't the same as online."  I said, "I saw that and I thought it was misleading.  Why would I want to drive to a store, find the product myself and then pay more?"

She said, "That's the way we do it."  So I'm thinking, this isn't an affiliate, it's the same store, different location.  Maybe this is how big business operates - "Caveat Emptor - let the buyer beware."  Now I know to double-check online versus in store.  It doesn't leave me with a warm and fuzzy feeling for Office Max, though.A month ago, I called the online store to order some panels.  The operator transferred me to the Scottsdale store (Kierland Commons ) because she said that the store still had some.  She put me through there and then I got to talk to a salesperson named 'Catherine'.  From the beginning, she was already very rude and snobbish.  She seemed to me that she didn't care my business while all along I had been showing apprections for her help.  The first call (May 30, 2006) I made I ordered 3 silk long panels.  I first checked with her the number of stocks she still had because I told her that I actually needed 2 more but I got to discuss it with my hubby first that night.  She asked me for my number so that she could check.  Throughout the conversation, I didn't hear her saying 'thank you', 'please', 'have a good one' at all but 'hmm hmm'.   When she called me back, she said she found the panel that I wanted.  Then, she asked me for shipping information and credit card details.  I told her slowly but it seemed to me that she was not ready at all.  She kept mis-spelling my 'four-letter' common last name.  I had to repeat the information for her several times without her appreciations.  I asked her when I'd get the shippment.  She said that she didn't know.  I asked her which company was responsible for the shippment and she said with uncertainties that it could be UPS or Fedex.  There was no confirmation number, no nothing.  Before I hanged up, she offered to hold 2 more panels for me for 24 hours.  I appreciated her help and told her that I'd call her back before the timeline which was around 6pm (May 31, 2006).  When I called her the next day at 11am, she told me that she already shipped it out and she told me that she had nothing to do with that.  I asked why and she just told me that she didn't know.  I reminded her of her offer and my desire to ship all 5 panels together to save some shipping and handling costs.  She replied that she didn't know.  Throughout the conversation, again there was no apology.  I was so pissed but I still thanked her for her help and as usual, she just 'hmm hmm-ed' me.  About 10 days later, I got my first shipment and I got my bill already.  Out of my expectation, I received my second order - 2 panels but not my first order and the size of one of them was wrong.  I was so upset and then I called straightaway.  John answered the phone and told me that Catherine was not there.  I told John what was happening and expecting that John would offer to help me but he just shunned me off.  I called again the next day and got to talk to her.  She said she didn't know why and she told me that she could not check for me.  She asked me for my number again during lunch and she promised to call me back but she didn't.  I had to call her back after 5 hours.  I asked her for updates and she said she was too busy to do the research.  I was so pissed because I couldn't go out just because I didn't want to missed her calls.  She then required me to tell her all the information she was supposed to have AGAIN including when I made the purchases, credit card information, address, etc.  I was so angry and she asked me to fax her my credit card bill because she suspected me of lying to her.  She asked me to send the panels back as a proof so that she would send the correct ones over.  I asked who would pay for the shippment and she said she didn't know but I had to arrange it.  The whole thing was terribly ridiculous.  I was so on the fire and requested for speaking with her mgr and she told me that her mgr was with a customer.  She AGAIN asked for my number so that her mgr would call me back.  After 30 minutes, my hubby came home and I told him my unpleasant experience and the fact that the mgr didn't call me back yet.  He called and talked to the mgr.  The mgr apologized and offered to arrange Fedex pick up for us. He said he would give us the money back once he got the panels back.  As we checked, they got the panels a long while ago already but they still didn't do the credit yet.  We reported to AE and made sure that they WOULD never get the money.  We are so sure to tell you that we'll never shop at Z-Gallerie again!So, I hate writing bad reviews, especially for a local business. But, when we could get better pizza and a bag of salad at Costco and save the $30 price tag, have to pass it on. 
Place was nice, but no one seemed to want to be there. The manager walked around saying 'boo' to no one, the cooks couldn't get an order right for our table or the 2 others next to us, and the food was really disappointing. Pizza had absolutely NO taste and the salad was totally just chopped lettuce and a slice of avocado for $13. The only reason it gets a single star is for our waitress - she was so kind and helpful, felt sorry for her to be working there. 
Plenty of other places to go in the area, but not here.probably fun for a family. food was ordinary. staff were not responsiveAlso a frequent Westgate visitor. Been here a few times, its not that good of a bar to begin with.

On top of that they are in the same district as the Coyotes and during the hawks game were playing the HAWKS goal song. The response when being asked was basically whatever its part of a list of songs we play.

They are a disgrace to the community, will never go there again.Where to start! I should have stuck to my normal place. First off they had no hot water for the pedicures and seemed like they could care less my feet were freezing. It was was overpriced, you have to pay at least 30 bucks to get someone to actually touch  you because their express $18 pedicure only consists of a polish change. The pedicure was the worst ive had, lazy, no effort and rushed. Not to mention being nipped and cut a bit too close. I would say to any one curious, don't be, i went only because i was with a friend and i wanted to leave once i found there to be no hot water but my friend was polite and stayed. Angry at the waste of money and no service! Could have done better myself! Rude. Thanks for ruining a girls day!I wanted to love this place as it's adorable and tucked into a corner at Harper's Nursery. The gentleman staffing the bar seemed a bit gruff, but a good caffeine fix will help me forgive even the orneriest grump.

That being said, my iced mocha was among the worst I have ever experienced. It was bitter and full of grounds. A few sips turned my stomach. This will definitely not be a repeat for me, no matter how many times I wants to skip about the lovely plants at Harper's.The customer service is extremely slow.  I arrived at 12:30 am and waited an hour in line behind 6 other people.  We all had reservations but for some reason the 4 people behind the counter couldn't move us along at all.I would l like to say I have a good review, but unfortunately not. I really think that service is the key to great reviews and even if the food or product isn't good most would at least consider a second chance in order for one's to redeem themselves just because of great service. But in my case that service never really came.
I went to the place after work one night. After seeing it the day prior while on that side of town, I was excited to see something outside the typical here and there fast food. Plus it never hurts to see so many good reviews on yelp.  I drove out of my way that night and made it to the restaurant about 8:15. I admit I was apprehensive being out late and not familiar with the place and its operating hrs but after seeing a small group of what appeared to be customers because the waitress was serving them drinks and clearly reading the sign outside for a minute or so I proceeded in. I was happy to see a employee come hastily over to what I thought was  greet me but instead of that he rudely said that they closed at 8 and that I needed to go. I was shocked and embarrassed. He walked away never said sorry or please come again just walked away. I then left but not after reading the sign again which clearly stated 9 p.m. I also considered that the doors were still open. I sat in the parking lot and watched for a few minutes and also noted that no-one came to lock the doors which is standard procedure for most places when closing and not wanting any other patrons to make same mistakes but nothing happened. 
I watched as the waitress continued to serve the group inside. 5 minutes passed and another tray of food came out to the group. I drove away quite upset vowing never to even attempt to come again. I suggest to anyone interested not to come after 8 or you just might be wasting your time because they clearly don't want to serve anyone according to the sign in the window. And maybe if the owners read this you will change the sign so no-one else does the same thing and you don't lose more of what could be potential customers.Under new ownership/staffing now and the quality of the food has declined dramatically. 

A real shame, it was a great old north valley resto.Nicole S. has said it all.  

Tonight we had an added attraction,  the entertainment was watching the sushi chef smell the fish in view of the dinners.  Maybe that should have been done in the back before they opened for dinner.I had heard good things about this place and was really excited to try it but my experience was awful. I never write negative reviews but this was exceptionally terrible. The waitress acted like she was bothered serving us, she almost stabbed my mother (slid a sharp knife across the table instead of handing it) and didn't bring us silverware after we asked several times (not sure why it wasn't already on the table). Anyway the food was mediocre at best, I've had better Italian food at Olive Garden. I had a Caesar salad, but I tried the chicken and penne ala vodka. My chicken was burnt and the others were just ok. Aside from a hair in the food and sticky silverware. Will not visit again.To say this place is over-priced is an understatement. $4.05 for a 16 oz. cup of coffee? Starbucks is cheaper than that! Of course I could have had free coffee on the casino floor if I could find a waitress!Pain in the Tanis!  We ate here a few nights ago and absolutely hated it, mostly thanks to our terrible server, Tanis.  She refused to bring us any menus and assured us she would customize a meal for us that we would love... I left hungry.  There were 6 of us total, 2 of us don't eat any fish.  We told her that in the beginning when she was refusing to bring out menus.  For our second course, she brought out raw fish for the fish eaters and cooked fish for the non fish eaters... wtf?  I waited around 15 minutes for her to come by again so I could get something different to eat.  When I was finally able to flag her down, I asked if the two non fish eaters could get something non fish, to which she replied, "I brought out two extra fish dishes for everyone else.  There's nothing you can eat for this round."  That's obviously terrible customer service.  She could've brought us out another two mediocre kobe mini tacos like she brought for us the first round, but she obviously doesn't care about her customers experience in her restaurant.  I had also ordered a drink from her which I suspect she intentionally forgot since she knew I was upset with her, it was her way of getting back at me.  When I complained about it to my friend she conveniently was able to hear me that time and asked, "Was there something about another drink?"  I told her I didn't want anymore drinks from her because I was not going to play her little immature, power games.  So instead I left the restaurant and walked to a nearby bar, came back to the restaurant and finished my drink there so that she wouldn't get anymore of my money.  Tanis is the worst waitress I have every come across in my entire life, and that's just after a trip to London, the city of zero customer service.  If Tanis doesn't like serving people, maybe she should look for a new job?  Thanks for the memories Tanis, I can't wait for you to see this!  :)Being completely honest, I'm usually not a fan of "special events," guest chefs, or the dumbed-down truncated experience of "Restaurant Week" but at $26 (after a deep discount from the quoted $100) with friends already planning on attending Chef Akira Back's "Chef's Tasting" at Yellowtail I tossed caution to the wind...only to reconfirm all the aforementioned prejudices to a whole new degree, leaving the event after 2 hours hungry, a touch intoxicated, and $26 poorer albeit richer in friendships.

"Spend the afternoon with us at YellowTail inside the Bellagio Las Vegas overlooking the spectacular fountains. Enjoy extraordinary culinary selections from Chef Akira Back and libations provided by Wirtz Beverage.  Chef Akira Back has chosen to feature the Big Eye Tuna Pizza, Crispy Kalbi roll and his famous Baked Crab Hand Roll among other items.  Gulf Oyster Industry Counsel's amazing Oyster bar. Salty coastal waters produce the world's best oysters for the world's best chefs and restaurants, harvested today as they have been for generations.  Chef's menu will be paired with specialty reserved Sakes, Wines & Spirits provided by Wirtz Beverage and custom cocktails created by the mixologists from Hendrick's Gin and Tito's Vodka" as described on the website, the actual format of the event was a standing circus of confusion where "reserved" tables were fed full trays of food while the rest attempted to hunt down one of four circulating servers that were frequently mobbed and stripped clean at the doors where 'diners' gathered like a group of kids playing World of Warcraft sitting on a spawn spot.

With booze of decent quality and the modicum of food equally competent a total of six mouthfuls of food plus three oysters were accrued by myself (one literally FROM a reserved table) during the course of the afternoon, probably justifying the $26 though certainly not $100 or the overall aggravation.  With no Akira in site and 'live music' that fell through for unknown reasons I can only assume that this 'event' was a money-grab intended to draw high rollers to The Bellagio or an attention-seeker for an outdated property hoping to generate new fans; both goals a miserable failure as we walked out in search of sustenance down the strip at Aria.Two stars for food, no stars for Service = one star.This burgers here are great....at being inconsistent.  I thought the burger I ate my first visit here was the best burger I've ever eaten.  Unfortunately, subsequent visits made me rethink my sobriety during my first visit.  I've had burgers that were overcooked, undercooked, greasy, dry, too thick, or too thin. Burgers are never the same.

The one thing they're consistent at is service.  It sucks.  At all times of the day, every day of the week.  This last time we had to wait almost 10 minutes after we were seated to get our drink orders taken, and we were the only customers in the place!  That was the last time I go there, that's for sure.

They have a large selection of milkshakes.  So they've got that going for them, which is nice.Priceline will be losing business from this experience as well which is really unfortunate, but I can't risk renting from a company like this again.

My experience is similar to Chung's and many others'. 

1. Check-In took about 30 minutes once I arrived at the counter - 25 minutes longer than any other rental car company.
2. Shady business practices in upselling techniques where they tried to tack on a number of other charges hoping I wouldn't notice in lieu of the (sh***) upgrade that was given.
3. Once I got to the car, which reeked of marijuana masked by grape robitussin, it was late at night and I just wanted to get out. I didn't see any damage to the car, or anything that looked abnormal from any other rental car I'd ever gotten.- granted it was late at night and the lighting in the parking structure was not good. So I took it and went to exit -  Getting off the lot took several minutes because the representatives just wanted to "kick it" in their garage center.
4. Upon return of the rental car, the representative pointed out a door ding, no more than a quarter each - that were barely visible. I seriously was like "what? where?" until I realized what they were pointing at.  


In a hurry to make it to my flight, they said I needed to fill out paperwork acknowledging the car door ding that clearly occurred with someone else hitting their door against the rental car door - I replied I didn't have time to and I'd like to speak with a manager.  The manager tells me that if I don't complete it, they will - and threatened that if I let them complete the paperwork, they'll "write whatever they want". So I spent 10 minutes completing all of the information, citing how the door ding is so barely visible I wouldn't have even reported it had it been there when I picked it up, then I took pictures of the car with a camera I happened to have on me, and rushed to my flight.

They are now trying to collect $659 from me for this door ding along with other items that I hadn't heard of nor are they accurate. NEARLY SEVEN HUNDRED DOLLARS!! 

If they think this is supposed to be a lesson to purchase their expensive insurance the next time around, they are dead wrong. I'll be sticking with National/Enterprise/Avis from here on out.This review is for the CASINO FLOOR only. I didn't stay here, thank goodness. 

My friends and I stayed at The Mirage but stopped here just to check out the casino and play some slots. It was March Madness weekend so all of the TVs were showing the games. After playing a bit, I decided to watch some basketball. All the seats at one bar were taken, and there was another bar that was closed next to it that also had TVs with the game on. So, naturally, a few of us bar patrons bought a drink at one bar, then sat at the closed bar area just to watch the game. 

Now, this bar is not a closed space. It's just a counter with chairs along a casino walkway. So, many people who walked through stopped periodically to watch the game. Soon, bar staff walked behind the counter and said nothing to us as we watched, and we didn't bother them. Then a security guard comes by and says that since the bar is closed, we can't sit at the counter and have to leave. Yes, his exact words were "You have to leave." Mind you, we were all paying customers with drinks on hand. We weren't yelling or screaming. We were all actually pretty quiet enjoying the game. He stayed there until everyone picked up their drink in amazement and began to leave.

If we were loud, or brought in outside food, or took up space that other paying customers needed, I'd understand. But hell, we bought drinks at the bar next door which had no empty seats left. And the seats at this bar weren't being used. Even the bar workers didn't care we sat there.

I got similar treatment watching some of the card games. I got rude dealers asking, "Well are you going to play?" This place just cares about taking your money and places zero premium on customer service. I would never stay here even if they comped me a room.I dunno... 

I loved their LA store.  This one in Vegas, though, is like the LA restaurant's forgotten (disowned) little brother with drug and gambling problem.  

Where do I begin? 

The service was not rude, just nonexistent.  The food was overcooked (I couldn't help but think that the two are correlated).  We never got the refill of the tea despite the waitress' acknowledgment of our multiple requests.  The meat was tasteless.  And by God, it's the Vegas strip price at $28 per person. 

Remind me to never go off the strip in Vegas again.  Unless we're going to Rehab at the Hard Rock Hotel.I was in the this store fish department to purchase 3 little fishes and ask them for cleaning and deep fry it, after 40 mins waiting, no fish ask worker for several times...reposed " ya ya is coming" finally I saw my fishes still in the cleaning sinks, what %$$#%^^... this is the way treat the customer?? complaint to store manager (young kid do not know how to run the store..) and....he wants me wait another 30 mins......thanks nice try, just want every one beware their fish department whole store screw up, I wish you guys think about what kind of feeling after long wait and toward the end what it is ending story?? and finally I wish your store will be success good luck!!!     



TO STORE OWNER:  if you do not like my review please contact me, I will give you more detail. basic you need take good look your fish department employees, they have some problem (base on I was standing there for 40 mins), for me this is first time visited store and I came all the way from Vancouver Washington State and I know what happen, if you care about your review please contact me..I have a lots of to say.
email: usaplate1@yahoo.com.twOne word describes the food here...HORRIBLE!

Everything was salty! From the appetizers to the salad and soup. WAY too much salt, we couldn't even eat our sample platter because of the over seasoning. I seriously tasted salt in my mouth for 2 days after eating here and felt sick. I love salt. I practically drink soy sauce so you know it's REALLY bad when I say something is too salty.

I also had a salmon Caesar. Salmon was over cooked, lettuce soggy, and again salmon, salad SALTY! They need to keep their cooks away from the shaker!Yelp reviews made this place sound neat. The place has no ventilation . I walked in for 30 seconds and walked right out.  I am pretty sure I got cancer !The food itself seems bland and the rice seemed old. Would rather go to the great greek.i was desperate and it was open but i will never go there again. DIRTY! i felt a nail infection happening as they were working on me... i was so nervous after they started and i was looking around and noticed how gross it really was i wanted to just get up and leave but i didn't... i regretted that because they did a crap job and were rude. The guy working on me commented how bad my feet were.. aw, yes i know thats why i'm here getting a pedicure... like i should be embarrassed because i don't take care of my feet... well i was then, thank you!  The theme and concept is great especially for Vegas but they need to clean up their act and people... ill never go back!~ Christopher's Guide to Etiquette & Comportment ~

Always greet your guests by cooly asking if perhaps they have a gift certificate. Never share pleasantries or offer the night's specials. This helps guests feel unwelcome and unsure of what the chef is serving. Likely, they will then be eager to prove that they are worthy to breathe your rarefied air, and full of wonder and excitement at the mysteries that await them.

When the restaurant is empty, leave your guests to sit all night in quiet contemplation and prayer. It is more important to feed their souls than their bellies.

Lobster pot pie should be served lukewarm and with a steak knife. If guests are stout enough to carve the lobster, they are most certainly hooligans. Firmly direct them to the nearest ethnic restaurant.

Adjectives are vulgar. Scallops are therefore potentially the most noble of dishes. In texture, temperature, freshness, taste, and presentation, scallops should be purified of any describable features. 

Guests will show their appreciation for your culinary artistry by sending all the food back untouched. You wouldn't eat a Monet, would you? Under no circumstances should you suggest a different dish, nor should you offer to comp their bill. 

It is polite to promise to bring the manager to the table, but ill-advised to actually do so. Your guests are famished, and you do not want to get in their way.

The cheque should be wildly inflated. It is your patriotic duty to charge guests gratuity and taxes on all of the already over-priced food they sent back.Terrible business, will not return! Requested a patio seat, wherein the receptionist was busy answering phones and doing other tasks, even at one point after telling her our request, took a phone call and then asked us again our preference. We then waited our 30 minutes, and they tried to seat is at a table behind the bar! When we said this is not what we had requested, the manager told us they did not have any seats outside and we would have to wait again!! We said no thanks, and left the hotel to which there were SEVERAL open tables outside! Unacceptable, and the manager did not help or assist us in any way! Don't waste your time...Beware! If you don't know anything about cars at all, do not use him. He will try and cheat you. I was in from AZ and I thought I blew a hose on my charger 2006. He comes to look at it, can't find a bad hose. To make a long story short. He went under the hood and shorted out my coolant temp sensor, with this probe he used. The car shut off. When it re-fires the Temp gauge doesn't work any more. Proceeds to tell me my head gaskets are blown. This car has 56,000 miles on it. Anyway I knew enough about cars to know, that wasn't it and he had damaged something.

I made it back to AZ with no problems, HEAD GASKETS ARE FINE.
Turns out he shorted out the temp sensor and that's why the gauge didn't work, witch I replaced and everything is fine on the car. I had dealer double check it. It had over headed because the radiator car failed and leaked coolant.

So this guy was willing to let me have to fly my fiance home so she good be back with the kids and strand me in Vegas for a week. While he did a 1800$ head gasket job that didn't need to be done. He saw out of state plates, Sunday afternoon with no other mechanics readily available and a guy who appeared to no nothing about cars at all and tried to rip me off

Do not use him.He will if he thinks he can, rip you off.

ALSO HE IS DIRTY AND HIS TRUCK IS A PILE OF SH*T. VERY UNPROFESSIONAL. THE CASINO I WAS AT WOULDN'T EVEN LET HIM NEAR THE CAR ON THERE LOT.I USED TO BE a huge fan and customer! First allow me to begin by understanding that any business has instances and as a business owner I understand that things can go wrong and people have their moments, but this airline has become way off-track and has serious problems. 
1.  I arrived at Las Vegas expecting, as any respected airline will have, curbside baggage check and or attendants. Not Virgin!  Caused me to be late and huge inconvenience.

2. I have a conference in Ft. Lauderdale, FL, and from LAS, I decided to book through Virgin, and also my friend's flight through Virgin. I WAS such a fan that despite having to go through San Fran, I still booked through Virgin, as I knew Virgin has no directs to Ft Lauderdale from LAS. Even though I found direct flights cheaper in price to Ft Lauderdale I convinced my friend to book with me on Virgin. We booked weeks in advance and requested window and isle so that we could travel together.  When we arrived in SFO today on April 11, 2012on flight VX 342 dep 11:00AM I looked at my ticket and noticed that we were not sitting together. Going to the counter at the terminal to fix the situation I was told the flight was booked full. THEY LIED. We asked for seats closer to each other on the flight and we were told by a young and clueless Virgin "Representative" that we would be moved to isle seats across from each other. I then asked, as I fly very frequently, if the seat reclined? I was ASSURED they did. I'm stuck on a cross country flight in the full upright position!

3. To add INSULT to injury, when we board the flight, it's only 3/4 full!  With many empty seats, but none together. Now we are stuck on a long flight with seats that do not recline!!! 

4. To add to this horrible experience the flight attendant was the rudest airline staff member I have encountered and the issue was not the seat it was the fact that I lost a $2K Rolex dial either at the gate or in the plane and she acted like I lost a piece of gum, horrible attitude and she had no concern or assistance. Horrible and insulting experience. 

These were not simply isolated incidents. I was a fan of the airline. Please take my advice and understand I will never fly Virgin unless my life depends on it! Do not believe the hype of the 'cool lights' and a in flight mini screen!  This is a chain of experiences that have turned me from a long time Virgin America enthusiast and fan into a spiteful and resentful consumer. I will heed you with the advice from my friend as a first time Virgin flyer; " The lights were cool but they treated us like SH-T. I will stick with an airline that sells me a SEAT, not a crap shoot and is rude." I AGREE. DO NOT TRUST THEIR BOOKING SYSTEM OR TRUST THEIR STAFF TO ASSIST YOU OR TO BE PLEASANT.Came here for a birthday party of about 20 people.  The sashimi was so small I ate all 4 pieces in one bite.  After that disappointment I got my sushi.  I got the jalepeno roll.  Wasn't very spicy.  All in all average sushi.  This was a birthday party for 3 people I will add and by the time they brought out the birthday cake over half the party had left as we had finished our meal about an hour prior and there was only a handful of people left.

At the end of the night the wait staff tried to charge us all for items we didn't order which included $65 dollars in bottled water.  After we disagreed we asked to speak to a manager who shrugged the whole thing off and walked off during our conversation (possibly to admire his over priced suit in the mirror) leaving us wondering what the outcome was.  About 20 minutes later we decided to finally leave.  Not paying for overpriced bottled water.

This place is probably perfect for you if you want to get drunk and go upstairs and listen to horrible dance music after a average to below average mealI'm not entirely sure where the other guys went for their breakfasts but I highly doubt it was the same timewarp I stumbled into a couple of Sundays ago.

I can be a bit fussy about what I eat so was a little disappointed when my request for just scrambled eggs and haggis was met with laughter from the waitress. The disappointed only increased when she then told me they didn't even serve the latter - what country do I live in again?!

When the food finally arrived, (I'm not hugely impatient but when it takes fifteen minutes to cook up a simple request with no other customers around I do start to wonder what the cook is up to) it was even worse than my already low expectations allowed for - to say it looked unappealing is as much of an understatement as saying that Edinburgh can get just a little bit chilly in the winter. 

The scrambled egg was floating in a small pool of water and the lorne sausage (which had replaced the absent haggis) looked to have been pre cooked then microwaved and I can only imagine that biting a corner off one of the slightly dirty (and in much need of refurbishment) tables would have provided the same culinary experience. My only choice was to cover it all in ketchup and turn off my sense of taste (quite a skill I know) to get through it.

The price itself wasn't terrible, although I probably could have got the same stuff from Somerfield just down the road for around the same price. At least that way the eggs would have been cooked properly...


The Water Situation: my request for a glass of water here was met quite readily, although the server did look somewhat confused when I said I didn't want anything else to drink...Horrible!!! Meats were dry sweet tea was watery mac n cheese taste like boxed kraft. Bbq sauce runny. Never AgainBe for warned..... when checking out your detailed account may not have your resort fees listed.  A charge was made to my card 5 days later.  When I phoned to inquire as to what the fee was for, I was informed that it was the resort fee.  As far as I'm concerned if they can not be aware of the resort fees in conjunction with your nightly room rate, they are incompetent and should waive this delayed fee.  When I voiced my constructive opinion, I was told by "Heather"  that she would email me a detailed account.  WOW......First and last stay at Montelucia Resort for me.  Never have experienced such incompetence.....Thought I'd give this place another try since it's been nearly a year since my last unfavorable pizza here.  Maybe its just me having bad luck since this place gets so many rave reviews, but once again the large sausage pizza that I was staring at seemed to be a bare crust totally devoid of any toppings.  I understand that this place prides itself on its crust, but c'mon adding a few toppings won't kill it!  Virtually no cheese, tiny spots of sauce here and there, and very sparse little crumbles of sausage that must have been begrudgingly added.  I was at least smart enough to take home about half of it, since I remembered I had some left over Spinato's at home.  I took a slice of Spinato's and put it on top of the Grimaldi's "crust pizza" and when I re-heated it I finally had pizza the way its supposed to be! Spinato's ample delicious toppings on top of Grimaldi's coal fired "platform" was very tasty indeed!I can't understand how this place could be considered good by anyone. I at the chicken lettuce wraps and was sick a couple ours later. Bad ambiance, unhealthy choices, trans fat and more!Got food poisoning here yesterday--it was either from the lettuce or the shrimp dumplingWow i do not even know where to start!! first off i would like to say i had one of the best steaks of my life the night BEFORE at SW steakhouse... then Saturday we came here. i will go as far as saying it was one of the worse meals of my life. the staff including the hostess was so rued when we arrived. second how does a place serving chicken parm and lasagna have a strict dress code. now i will go into the food
we kept it simple and started with the meatballs (3) they forgot to mention MINI meatballs they were the size of a quarter. THEY HAD ZERO TASTE WHAT SO EVER...
i had the chicken parm for my entree it came out in a medal pan actually did not look that bad.. then i cut into it the chicken was very very thick and the cheese and sauce had no taste. after eating it i realized these dishes are 100% pre made. the side of spaghetti that was not included with the entree was so tiny and so mushy it could have passed as mashed potatoes. 
all 8 of us hated our food including the pasta with shrimp and lobster sauce and the lasagna. 
I'm not going to complain about the prices because we saw them before we went and i never mind paying money for a good meal.. BUT THIS PLACE IS NOTHING EVEN CLOSE TO A GOD MEAL.. STAY AWAY unless your from the Midwest and u do not know good Italian food this place is a no go. from the casino host himself i guarantee this place will be done within 6 monthsWent to Pastis in January and was terribly disappointed.

The service was awful; the waitress could not answer any questions about the menu.  She took our drink order (waters and beer). She brought our water and another couple came in(grand total of 3 couples in the restaurant).  The waitress then proceeded to take their order and spent 15 minutes with them bringing them different samples of beer.  After that she delivered our drinks and finally took our order.

When she initially took our drink orders (not our food order)she told us that certain appetizers were 1/2 price.  When we received our bill the appetizers were not 1/2 prize.  When we asked she told us the appetizers had to be ordered befor 7pm and we didn't order until after 7pm.  Of course we didn't order before 7 pm as she had spent 15/20 minutes with the other couple letting them sample beer while we waited to place our order.

The food was barely passable.  I asked the cook/chef LOL about the crab cakes and he assured me that everyone loved them and they were made in house.  Turns out the crab cakes were the 2nd worse I have ever had.  Either they were terribly made or they came out of a box frozen.

Also found out almost all the desserts other than the crepes are not made at the restaurant but are bought from somewhere else. As bad as the crepes were, they probably should have been bought somewhere else too.Do I even have to leave a star??? 
Stay away from place. Our room was robbed by the maid services here and the hotel wouldn't do anything about it because technically, it was our fault for leaving our fuc*ing belongings in the room??? Give me a break assholes I know your only trying to cover your ass and theif workers. FUCK THIS PLACE!I was a member at the Surprise location years ago, I left and joined fitness 1.  Recently I have been thinking about returning to Mountainside, due to convenience of various locations. I read many of the reviews and was reminded of the reason I left years ago.  That "Enhancement Fee" is bogus, try budgeting monthly membership fees for upkeep and maintainance. Each time a member complained about the enhancement fee the manager had a lame response, "Enhancement Fee was mentioned in your contract" .   Booooo .....  I'm so glad YELP was there to help me decide.  I'm definitely not returning to Mountainside gym.I would like to preface this review by saying that I have NEVER in all my 24 years been compelled to write a review online.  My experience today was so upsetting that I felt it had to be shared.  I live in north Las Vegas, but I was recommended to Dr. Keller for my yearly exam.  Things went smoothly, and I shared some personal information with her about my sex life.  Months later, she had somebody from her office call me about a new medication she would be offering that she thought would be helpful for me. I was excited! Not once throughout this conversation was it mentioned that neither my consultation nor the medication would be covered through my insurance.  I showed up this morning, and after 20 minutes of not being acknowledged by anybody at the front desk, they called me up to inform me that they had "forgotten to tell me that my insurance would cover none of this and it would be $150 dollars cash."  Their words exactly. Horrible communication skills and very unprofessional.  They apologized and said that that their computers were down this morning so they could not call and inform me.  I told them that they should have shared this information on the phone when they called me fishing for business.  It was a horrible waste of my morning and my gas money.  I showed a bit too much trust, but I will definitely never be back there.  Although I feel like most of this was going on without Dr. Keller even knowing, if her office staff is this incompetent then I will find another doctor.ok, tried once a few years ago, failing memory forced me to not know why we didn't go back... but my experience last Saturday night made it clear that I will never, ever, ever be getting back together... oops, I mean going to eat here. Drinks in the bar? Sure... restaurants really is not good.... Saturday night 7pm empty dining room shoulda made me run away... but i didnt... waitress barely said hello, seemed SO angry.. we ordered drinks, and the pot stickers -they came out.. pork pot stickers and they were cold... ick, so we waited to return them.. and no one ever came back to the table.. salads come out, and i have lots of brown lettuce....i put it on bread plate( waiting for second drink.. and when i asked our angry waitress where it was, she said it was ordered and looked at me like duh i forgot it) so food comes out... portions tiny... and so so... whole experience suxked to be honest. too bad cause i want it to be good! bye bye cannery grille.... bad,bad service, icky food and snottiness not for me!!I had such high hopes for this place.  Let me start off by saying that I am a breakfast person and very particular.  Breakfast ingredients are cheap and there are not that many unique combinations so it is an absolute necessity that it be done right.  If you are thinking, "Oh! That's me!", this is not the place for you.

First, the staff was friendly but not overly excited or very apologetic that it took 30 minutes to get our food.  It was also unpleasantly warm inside the restaurant.  I might be able understand if the place had been crowded, but it wasn't.  It was half empty at 11 am on a Saturday.

The food was not especially cheap for the quality.  I had the ham steak breakfast which was nearly $10 for ham, eggs, toast, and potatoes.  Here are some thoughts from my meal and what else was ordered at our table:  The ham was tasty but it was sliced ham and not a ham steak.  My over easy eggs were browned* .  The toast was cold*.  The pancakes were fluffy but dry like a biscuit and not spongy.  The home fries were tasteless and undercooked*, unless you like hard potatoes.  The "cream" for the coffee wasn't cream, it was milk.  The sausage patties used were the cheap ones you can buy frozen at Walmart and hardly qualify as meat. 

I let out a sigh of relief when we stepped out into the open air; glad to be finally free from waiting for someone to take payment while enjoying the cool breeze rushing across the back of my legs, cooling them as it evaporated the moisture built up from an hour of sitting on a cushion in an over-warm room.  The joy of this moment left me with one final utterance, "Eff that place."

On the bright side, this has motivated me to start writing reviews instead of only reading them.

* denotes things about a breakfast that would make me want to punch a kitten.I rate this a 1 star because of their crappy service.  45 min wait they said at the door for just me????  I walk through the restaurant to access the strip and I see table upon empty table.  Someone needs to fire a GM and hire some staff.  I hope to try the food one day, perhaps at the real one in LA will be better.The worst experience I've ever had in my life!!!!  Rare 120 offers a complimentary dinner for female groups.  They are somehow connected to the HRH Vanity Club and their purpose to is to bring girls to the club to attract men clientele.  We had reservations for 14 girls and for whatever reason they had us down for 6... No bueno to start off the night.  Carlos Harper who's the host of the restaurant, told us they were arranging to get a table together because of the confusion and we would be seated immediately.  We arrived at 9pm and he made us wait for AN HOUR!!!  We're not expecting anything major from a free dinner but if he couldn't accommodate us he could've said it, so we could decide whether to stay there or leave.  Instead he kept saying to wait 15 minutes and of course an hour had elapsed since he advised us of the wait.

The dinner finally was served at 1015pm.  We ordered drinks which are not included with our meal.  The food quality was as of any low-end steakhouse, nothing spectacular to brag about.  Of course it was free so we can't complain on that part. We were ready to go by 11pm so we told Carlos to get us ready because we had our reserved table at Vanity and we wanted to take advantage of our time as much as possible.  Carlos told us to wait a few minutes because he needed to walk us to the club so we didn't have to wait in line.  While we waited for him we proceeded to pay for our tab, a total of $66 and change.  We put down some gratuity in cash but since our service was horrible we left what we thought was appropriate.  

We waited for Carlos for another 30 minutes!!!!  We were just furious at this point and we left the restaurant and walked ourselves to the club.

A couple days later I checked my account and there was a charge for $93.78 for the drink tab at Rare 120. WTF???  My tab was $66 and change and somehow I got charged $30 more!!! I don't know if they just added their own gratuity on there, but if they did without my consent that's total fraud.  I'm in the process of disputing this charge with them.

People, stay away from this place and from all the Hard Rock venues as I'm also in the process of disputing another transaction from Vanity that was charged to my account, but this one is for $576.  They're total THIEVES!!  Beware of what you are paying for and always make sure you keep all your receipts, otherwise you would have additional charges that you never authorized.  

Needless to say, I will never, ever, ever in a million years will trust any of the HARD ROCK facilities!!!I used to enjoy coming to this place but my experience this past weekend prompted me to sign up for Yelp and write this review.  When I came here a few weeks ago, I figured the horrible service was a fluke but the "too cool to notice you" staff this weekend confirmed the disappointing turn in customer service.

Here are the "highlights" of the night:

1.  Picked up friends from the airport and arrived at Gallo Blanco before 10pm.
2.  Asked for a table for 5 and were told that the wait would be 15-20 minutes, which was not a problem for us.
3.  10:20pm:  decided to change the party number to 4 since one friend wasn't able to make it anymore.
4.  Seated a few minutes later to a dining room and patio at 40% capacity.  Really?!?
5.  Menus and water brought to the table.
6.  10:30-10:35pm:  Staff consistently ignored my fiancé, who was trying to track down our server since we were ready to order.  During this time, we saw other tables being tended to and waited on.
7.  Walked out of the restaurant.  The hostess, servers, and other staff failed to notice or say anything as we left.

 It's understandable if the restaurant was busy but the dining room was practically empty at the time my fiancé was trying to get someone's attention.  Maybe it's because we're Asian but I guess the staff felt we didn't deserve the attention they gave to the other cool, hipster people there that night.  I felt awful for bringing my friends here and wasting their precious time on their quick trip to Phoenix.  Thanks Gallo Blanco for wasting an hour of my life.  Your food is not good enough to deserve a repeat visit.Had gift certificates so figured, why not? Got the sampler, some beers, and some mashed potatoes. Nothing in the sampler was particularly good...and the mashed potatoes tasted like nothing other than undercooked potatoes.Very Unhappy With the Service Department.

Recently I had some problems with a S550 that would not start.  I had the car towed in to the Henderson location on a Monday and was advised that most likely I had a faulty key but since the keys were so expensive they would attempt to diagnosis the problem.  Never received an update so I followed up with the service advisor and told yes I needed a key.  Each day I had to follow up with my advisor as I never received any updates, yet the advisor was able to tell me a laundry list of things that I should replace that had nothing to do with why the car was in the shop.  On Friday I was told the car was ready for pickup and the new key worked but now the interior lights would not turn off and that I needed to replace the circuit board for $1600.  I was advised it would not be wise to pick up the car unless the circuit board was replaced.   I asked that they just unplug the lights which they did.  I picked up the car and paid the $600 for a new key.  Got home plugged my lights back in and guess what they worked just fine and have not had a problem since.  But here is where the real problem begins, my key that just cost $600 did not work.  Took the car to the Sahara location and they were able to diagnosis the problem it was a faulty EIS which I replaced and have had no problems since.  Went back to Henderson and asked for a refund on the key as clearly the key was not the problem and they did not correctly diagnosis the car, was advised that there was nothing they could do, nor did they apologize for giving me back my car only to have the key not work once the vehicle returned to the house.  Nor were they able to give an explanation on why the Sahara dealership could fix the problem when they could not.  For these reasons I would strongly avoid not taking your car to the Henderson dealership.The worst thai food place I've been to. Don't waste your time here! Pad thai was bland and cashew nut chicken was extremely disgusting. It's a very small portion and pretty expensive for it. Servers were rude and they never asked about our food. Spicy hot wings made me want to commit suicide with their mighty garlic chunks and sweet sauce just thrown on top. We asked for extra napkins and they litterally gave us ONE. Had to beg for a refill and to get the check. We should of walked out ... And I wouldn't regret it not one bit. Worst $39 spent !Not a fan, waiter had an attitude. So much so they gave us another waiter.  The wine we ordered was "not in the warehouse". We had to ask two different people if our waiter could take our order. I'm here now ordered over 25 minutes ago. An easy steak, and cheeseburger and have yet to receive our order. The only good part was the bartender and his recommendation for an appetizerDo not go to this place. Overpriced and food poorly made. A group of six friends went there last tuesday and was a horrible experience. Out of four meal orders, three had to be returned to kitchen and even that two of them were sent back to us frozen inside, which means bad and lame preparation by the chef. The pasta was so so and oily. The wine list was overpriced compared to the menu. Manager came to apologize but was too late. The experience had already gone bad. We were so excited about this place because of its location, Aria Hotel, but it does not deserve to be in a place like this. We strongly do not recommend this restaurant.While in Vegas, you have a finite number of meals to enjoy. This is one I wish I had back. 

I heard good things about the nearby Bellagii buffet, but there was an hour wait. I decided to take the tram to the beautiful new Aria to check out the buffet. The fact that there was no wait with a half empty restaurant should have been a warning sign.

The only thing about this meal that alluded to the fact that I was in a fine hotel was the unnecessarily heavy silverware and glass stemware for the water. After that, everything else was largely unimpressive. From the food to service, this could be a run of the mill buffet anywhere. It certainly does not fit the image that Aria is trying to convey. 

King crab legs - how could you go wrong? They were chilled and had an unappealing smell to them. The shrimp were set in a glass with what looked to be cocktail sauce, but it only tasted like ketchup. The buffet is long but rather boring. 

I'm chewing through valuable phone battery with this review, but if it keeps someone from spending $40 on a boring, sub par buffet, it's worth it. 

This has to be up there with one of most disappointing Vegas meals. 

Even if this meal had been comped, I would have still felt ripped off. 

Had it been reasonably priced for what it is, it may have received two stars. I've had other mediocre buffets, but it was nowhere near the cost of this, hence the one star rating. 

Time  to wash this sorry crab leg smell off my hands. 

Never again.Food is delicious but the service was absolutely terrible!!!! Especially in the evening. When we went during lunch, the food came out quick. 
But last night was just terrible!
We went to the hostess to request a table for two, the restaurant wasn't even that packed..there were so many seats open. 
But it took them 10min to "clear our table" which was already clear (we could see it from the entrance).
We got seated and waited at least 10min for someone to come. The waiter asked for our drink order and told him we were ready to order our dinner. He goes "I'm just here for drinks..let me check with the other tables and will come back for your order". We didn't understand why he couldn't just take our order and put it in...he was gone for 15min and he finally came back to take our orders and brought our drinks. My friend had asked for a straw and he said okay, walked away.. We asked another waitstaff for a straw, they said okay and walked away...then the manager comes up and we asked her for a straw but again she said I'll be back and never came back. It's a straw, how hard is it to get one???

Food came 30min later..and the food was great. I ordered the grilled corn and quinoa salad. Once they took our plates away, we asked for the check..and my friend ordered another beer. It took them another 20min just to bring the check and they forgot about the beer. 

All I can say was that service was SLOW!!!!! 
They didn't come back to check on us to see how we were doing, no refresh on drinks...they weren't friendly either!
If you're staying at the Arizona Grand I wouldn't dine here..go somewhere else or order it to go.Long, straggly hair found deep in an order of fried rice? Free of charge.

Not going back to Ha Long Bay? Also free of charge. Or as the think tank at MasterCard would like you to think, PRICELESS.

Regardless of the stray hair, a good rule to go by is that if a restaurant serves more than fifty items, as is the case at HLB, they're bound to be frozen and terrible... excepting the items dipped in the deep fryer (the egg rolls are quite nice, but obviously frozen!)

The service.        Well.         Slow.

Regardless of slow service and the errant hair, Ha Long is a comfy place to dine if you've got the time and inclination for a by-the-book Pan-asian dining experience. It's salty, swimming in oil, and close to your door if you live in the Wil-Mar neighborhood.stopped here this weekend, late afternoon, and got some shriveled up donuts.... should have gone to Krispy Kreme!!!No, no, no. This was a waste of my time and money. Unless you want to endure an hour and a half of highly offensive coarse sexually distasteful jokes, don't bother. They don't offer any creative material unfortunately. I saw 3 comedians on a Saturday night and all were filled with the same lame crude style of jokes. I wish I would have missed this to actually see something better.The only thing was good about this place was the (mature) cashier very nice. The fried soft shell crab and the combo shrimp and catfish  with fries was nasty.I know you're saying how can fried food be nasty??? I wish i could tell you,but it was.We had a party of 5 celebrating a b-day! I am giving them 1 star not because of the food, it was because of waiting for over 1 hour for our food. After an hour of waiting and watching the other par tons leave because they can not wait, our appetizers came out then the soup. Then one by one our dishes came flowing out of the kitchen. The b-day girl insisted for us to wait, because to her the food is one of the BEST. The food was good, but not the BEST. Was it worth the hour wait? NO!BEWARE!!!  This place is a complete SCAM!  I went there a few times for the 10 dollar oil change they ended up stripping out my  oil plug, so I had a leak.  The next time I went in for an oil change they tried to say it was a valve cover gasket that would cost me 180 dollars to fix.  So I went to meineke to get another opinion they said it was just a stripped out oil plug. And that I should go back to the place I get my oil changed and have them fix it , since they are the ones that broke it.  So I went back and they said unless I can prove they did it, they wont do anything about it. So i showed him receipts from the last 3 times I was there for oil changes. Saying the problem had to of happened here, I only get my oil changed here. The manager pretty much said its not our problem unless you can prove it.  WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO VIDEO TAPE EVERY OIL CHANGE I GET??? REALLY ....    So now I have to get a whole new oil pan about 200 dollars plus a temporary fix on the plug until I can afford it..., Cause they can't even do an oil change right.  THEY TELL YOU THINGS ARE WRONG WITH YOUR VEHICLE THAT ARE NOT.  THEY LIE AND UP SELL YOU.  Please don't go here, they are nothing but LYING CROOKS......  And Now I'm out about 250 dollars, because of there LYING and INCOMPETENCE...  You've ben WARNED!!! 10 dollar oil change, YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR.... Plus sum extra LIES. A complaint has been filed with the Better Business bureau. If you've been taken advantage of by them, take the time to file a complaint. Its very easy and you can do it online. They need to go out of business!!!!Ordered a package from Amazon on 09/02/11 the delivery date was set for 09/06/11 the tracking said no gate code.  Excuse me my complex is very small about 8 townhouses and no electronic gates.  This is the 2nd time this company has done something shady.  I will write Amazon today and let them know how incompetent this company really is.  Ontrac is HORRIBLE!  -10 StarsI don't know why Amazon keeps using them.  They are just so unreliable. 

My first experience, the Ontrac guy threw my package from his van from the street onto my driveway.  I was at home and saw him do it.  My neighbor had a shipment from Newegg that was thrown over their fence just minutes before.  They probably didn't expect us to be home at 2pm on a weekday.

We called Ontrac to complain and the driver claimed that we were both lying.  They did not fire him as he is still delivering packages from Amazon to me.

My latest experience was with Amazon prime 1 day shipping.  They claimed an attempted delivery at 3:30pm.  I called them and they said the package was given to the wrong driver.  I asked why it said, delivery attempted then, and they said it defaults to that when something goes wrong.

The next day they claimed it was delivered and left at the patio.  I called and told them that I don't even have a patio.

At some point Amazon needs to drop them.  It makes them look bad.Placed an order to go and told it was 15 to 20 min.  20 min later, they still hadn't started cooking! They said it wasn't this busy when I called.  The thing is they should have cooked right after my call.  Not wait till they finished cooking for people who came in after my call.  The worst thing was that they asked whether I wanted to cancel my order as the chef did not know when the order would be ready.  Then, they said the chef is cooking now.  10 min later, I still haven't seen my order, while other orders pass by me.  Need better time management?!?!  And maybe honesty?  Our office has been using this place over a year but never again!Food was overpriced and mediocre at best.  Service was horrid.  We were greeted by one, order was taken by our main server, and food was served by yet another.  That and our actual server came back one time to ask if we needed anything, deemed our request unimportant and proceeded to never come back, but instead talked to the table behind us the whole time.  Won't be coming back.Maybe it was a bad day.  There must have been a hundred employees running around the store, but there was only one cashier on full service, a cashier who had plainly just been trained.  She should have had a manager bagging for her to help out ; instead she had to keep calling for help.  As a result, even though she was already in the process of checking out the customer before me when I got in line, it took about fifteen minutes before I walked out with my thirteen items.  Fortunately the ones she undercharged me for more or less made up for the ones on which I was overcharged.

There certainly is a lot of stuff here.  Other people I know say the to-go counters are pretty good.  Lots of frills, like a dietitian and clubhouse and pharmacy.  The selection of actual groceries is average, below average for produce.   

Prices:  not as good as Woodman's or Trader Joe's
Produce:  not as good in quality as Willy Street Co-op, Jenifer Street Market, or Trader Joe's
Veggie options:  a limited selection in the health food department, with prices on the steep side
To-go counters:  looked fresh and pretty good, but I didn't see anything vegetarian there so I passed on them
Bakery:  looked okay, but the items I wanted came only in plastic multi-packs, so I passed on this tooBarney's represents everything I hate in the world. Granted this is coming from someone whose never spent more than about 40 bucks on an article of clothing (besides shoes). Barney's consists of overpriced  yet cheaply made clothing for elitist assholes.  

Let me summarize Barney's in one quick story. 

We walk in...I meander over to a rack of women's shirts that are apparently 'on sale'. I find one that looks particulary average. I check the price tag. On sale for 450 bucks. As I'm checking the tag, the shirt starts to rip at the seam even though I'm only gently twisting the tag. Also...notice..."Made in China" on the back. Quality clothing MY ASS. 

There's nothing special going on here. If you were to take these clothes and hide them with other 'regular' clothes in a shitty thrift store like Savers, 99% of people wouldn't know which clothes are from actually from Barneys. Conversely...you could take a shirt from Savers...put it in Barneys with a 300 dollar price tag...and some douche bag who drives a Ferrari will pounce on it because he thinks it's trendy.

I hope this place goes out of business. That would make me happy. We've gone in here a few times and the place was deserted each time, I hope that's a sign that people are learning to not get duped by the hype machine. If you shop here, I'm laughing at you.

0/5.My wife and I ate at Cabo Wabo this past weekend 11/21/2009. The service was slowwwww!!! and the food was Gross. I ordered nachos and my wife ordered cheese enchilada and beef taco w/ rice and beans. The nachos had a few sprinkles of grated cheese and a nugget of dog food they call beef fajita. My wifes cheese enchilada was the worst enchilada EVER! and the rice was a big clump of sticky shit! My wife stuck her fork in the rice and picked the whole mess up in one big glob! NEVER EVER EAT AT THIS PLACE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!After my experience with this store I will probably not be upgrading my IPhone when my current cell phone contract runs out.  I have spent the last 3 days going between my carrier, Apple and the insurance company for my phone while everyone decides who is responsible for replacing my phone which is less than 1 year old, with a touchscreen that doesn't work right.  Finally I decided to go to Apple even though I had been advised I'd be responsible for paying for troubleshooting on a phone under warranty just so all options could be exhausted. I go in right after they opened and first get told that an appointment is required, fine I only had to kill an hour. I go back and the person at the "genius bar" apparently thought I was wasting his time with my lowly 3GS.  He couldn't have been more pompous and condescending.  Basically I was told that they weren't going to do anything until he probably saw the smoke practically coming out of my ears, then it was "Well I want you to be successful so I guess we can look at replacing the screen..." At that point I thanked him for wasting my time. Thankfully I had been in contact with the office of the CEO of my phone insurance who assured me that if Apple wouldn't resolve the situation, they would. I have a new phone coming tomorrow. Thanks Apple for being NO HELP at all.  I believe it's time to go back to Samsung.Does it matter what towing company you use?  Before my experience with Quik Pik I would have said no, "They're all the same."  Unfortunately that is definitely not the case with this company.   The driver, David, was rude and abrasive,  suffering from some inferiority complex that made everyone around him cringe.  When I called the main line to voice my concerns and express my issues with his conduct and professionalism,  I was dismissed.   

I cannot stress enough or warn others to avoid this company.   I would rather push my car over 100 miles in the middle of an Az record breaking scorching summer, burning my hands in the process,  than call these incompetent, negligent "tow specialists."The general manager was incredibly rude!  Overall disrespectful attitude, threw out my first/only glass of wine and responded with "that's too bad" & topped the night off with telling our waiter to let the birthday boy know that he was aggravated because he wanted to close.  There were 5 other parties still ordering drinks in the restaurant. After all the good past experiences I have had there, unfortunately I will always remember this one.  Lost 12 customers tonight.  

I Hate complainers and never pictured myself writing a bad review of anywhere but, I guess never say never.  

***The wait staff did a phenomenal job and should not be punished for the shortcomings of bad leadership.  Perhaps the general should consider learning from his troops.This place was horrible!  We got the free steak dinner and the service was the worse!  Our waitress talked to everyone.  It took an hour to get our dinner, and there was barley anyone in the restaurant.  Then it took another hour to get our check.  The food was boring.  The restaurant looked out dated and dirty.  The time we wasted there was not worth a free steak dinner.  I didn't want a potato with the dinner, I asked for french fries and the waitress told me no.  The texas toast was burnt, hard and stale.  Don't go back for the free dinner unless you lost allot of money gambling.Ok... Here we go... Bread? Awful. Meats? Horrible. Service? Non-existent. WHY ARE THEY ARE STILL IN BUSINESS?!?!?!?! Late night delivery.

THAT IS IT. I have ordered from here a ton of times and every time is the same... Late night but disgusting... Last night was the last straw... It is the worst sub shop in Madison. 

That is all.Used to LOVE it - I'll never go back.  Management = NOT mellow...

I used to go there at least once a week with my hubs- - ordered appetizers, entree, drinks...  We had a happy hour for work one Friday and it was pretty great so we opted to do it again. I called ahead and asked them if they could accomodate a table for about 30ish people. The past time we were there they put us on the patio so I requested it again - because I thought it was a better choice for them so we would be out of the way. It's also a very LOUD place - hard to talk to friends inside... The table was reserved without an issue.

When I arrived, my co-workers were already seated and a few of them were pretty angry. I was told that they had an issue with management not wanting to seat us because we were taking up spaces that paying customers would want. Mind you, when I arrived, there it was 4:30 on a Friday, the parking lot was fairly empty. There was no waiting. 

I think that they mistook us for a large party that had been there a few weeks prior...no evidence of this...just really bad treatement.

In order to ensure that they got enough "profit" from us I ordered two of ever appetizer for my table - shared tons of food -- it was fun. Everyone ordered drinks - seemed like we were actually turning into paying customers....hmmmm... I helped bus the tables and we all got out of there by 7pm.  The server really did her best -- the food was fine....

I asked to speak to a manager but the guy who had caused the initial issue was off duty. I attributed it to having a bad day or something -- thought for sure we would get an apology.  The manager actually told me that it might be better if we planned our happy hours on a Tuesday or Wednesday.  ???

One of my co-workers followed up with a management and they responded without any regret -- only suggested that we not take up their spaces for their customers...they actually stood by their argument that happy hour specials were a "gift" for their customers. I was wondering if they realized how much most of us used to go there.... "used to...".

This has been such a bummer for me and my co-workers because we really enjoyed going there but I won't ever be a Mellow Mushroom customer again based on the treatement they gave us.   We also have had two fundraisers for our school at Mellow Mushroom. That won't be happening again. 

If you have plans on a relaxing and "mellow" happy hour with your friends - do NOT go to Mellow Mushroom!no, said the little piggy. just no.

let's do the postmortem, shall we?

LOCATION
Hard Rock Hotel, which apparently attracts some of the most crass, uncivilized, and otherwise unsavoury individuals in Las Vegas

(DIS)ORGANIZATION
Classy, upscale venues have clearly designated individual queues for table reservations, guestlist, etc, in which guests can wait in an orderly fashion to enter. Vanity has a teeming mass of humanity engaged in a free-for-all as each person attempts to push, squeeze or otherwise make their way towards the entrance.

TABLES
The tables are packed way too close together, and the attendants make little effort to keep the dance floor from slowly encroaching on what little space exists around each table.  These are not tables at which one can enjoy dancing with one's party with undisturbed abandon, KWIM?

DECOR
The decor & furnishings are really lovely, which makes little piggies a bit sad, for it's surely wasted on the crowd in attendance here

MUSIC
Quite good, really. Now, if only a very small piggy could find a place to dance without getting knocked into, bumped, jostled or rudely propositioned . . . there's probably a better chance of a slot machine funding my retirement tho (*(oo)*)Blech... That's how I feel. 

I'm stuck at Summerlin Hospital and everyone knows how much hospital food sucks. So I send my husband out on a little journey to get me some fried rice. I take out my trusty iPhone, open up Yelp and see that my two closest options for Chinese are NY Chinese and Ho Ho Ho. Hubby wanted Ho Ho Ho but I wanted to try NY Chinese. I'm from NY so I wanted to see if this lived up to the name... Especially since I remember that this place came up during a talk thread a couple of months back. 

Ugh. 

I wish I had let my husband choose. The shrimp fried rice was not good. The shrimps seemed ok. The rice was not though. It had a strange consistency to it. Tasted pretty stale. I don't even know how to really describe it. It just wasn't right. 

The one thing I will say is that it is the only Chinese restaurant in the valley that has the duck sauce packets that I've seen. If you're looking for duck sauce, you'll find it here. Otherwise, I would rather drive an extra few miles to chinatown  get some fried rice.So sad...this place keeps getting worst every time.  All the food is saggy and over flowing with grease. And if you complain they give you an attitude. Over and over I keep getting my orders wrong and by the time I get home with the food I am just too disappointed to go back.  Called a couple of times and they don't care.  Yes I keep going back because it's the only Mexican food place in buckeye open 24 hrs...but I won't be back.
Can't wait for the one in Watson Rd. To open. Federico's let's see how your food is...Our fridge went out, so I called American Home Shield (AHS) and they sent these people out.  They came, said that a few things where wrong and ordered parts.  I was called back shortly just couple of days to schedule to get it fixed. They came out and replaced the parts.  I thought great! Now we have a working fridge again.  Nope not at all.  Nothing they did made any difference. Even the ice maker they replaced didn't work. (the old one kinda worked at least it made ice).  I called to get them back out.  They flat refused to come back and fix anything.  I was told that everything had to be done through AHS.  So I will be with out a fridge for another week while these clowns make excuses why what they did doesn't work.We had originally made a reservation at Thrifty, but when we got there and were in the process of paying for the car, the agent started rolling off her confusing spiel about how if anything happens to the car, we could be stuck with paying for not only the damage, but the time the car is out of commission, yada, yada, yada, and the insurance to cover this was $17 and change.  She couldn't even explain whether or not we'd still owe anything if there was an accident.  And she wasn't even nice about it.  After my husband signed everything, he saw that the bill went from $259 to nearly $400!  When I pointed out that $259 + $17 does not equal nearly $400, she said that it was $17 A DAY!  Truly, she acted as though theirs was the only game in town and it didn't make any difference to her whether we rented from them or not.  We canceled out the transaction - for which she flat out refused to give us any type of receipt - and then we started looking at the other companies.  We tried Dollar, but then found out it was also owned by Hertz (as is Thrifty), so the deal would be exactly the same.  Then we saw Advantage and decided to give it a try.  For about $100 less than what we would have paid at Thrifty or Dollar, we got a full-sized car which was automatically covered 100% by their Loss Damage Waiver.  Plus the agent at Advantage was so much more pleasant and friendly than that person at Thrifty.  For us, Advantage is the way to go from now on any time it is an option.I will be the first one to admit that I have a Starbucks addiction and go there each and every day. You may judge me based on the fact I do not support local coffee houses, and that is all fine and dandy. But what I want every morning to start my day is great customer service and a consistently great product. Is this too much to ask? I certainly think not.

Occasionally I visit this Starbucks on my lazier mornings because they have a drive thru. I must say, the level of service, plainly stated, sucks here. They make my drink wrong every time and usually argue with me about it. Last time I checked, if I order something daily I know what is should look/taste like. Please just make it right the first time, and if you messed it up.....just say sorry with a smile and re-do it. Enough said. I will never be back to this location again, even on my lazy days. Having the convenience of a drive thru is not worth dealing with the nasty employees and slow service.

Now if you want a great Starbucks experience I would highly recommend the location at Scottsdale Fashion Square. Every employee there has a great attitude and John the manager exemplifies consistently great service.NO is the simple word to this team of fools that do really shitty work. No No never again that simple. They totally screwed me. Good bye. Brakes are making soo many noises after a new brake job and they never fixed the AC either. Do NOT GO HERE!The actual experience of the CT was fine.  The techs were fine, etc.   BUT, the front desk staff is horrible.  It turned out that the test was going to cost @ $230 up front, which surprised me as I have never paid anything up front before besides a small co-pay.  Other imaging places always billed the insurance and then billed me for anything that remained.  Not this place.  She called me up, and abruptly (almost rudely) said, "How are you paying for the $230 copay?"  Those were literally her first words to me.  No explanation of what this cost was for.  No easing me into the fact that I needed to hand over hundreds of dollars 4 days before Christmas.  Basically no people skills at all.  I needed the test, so I paid the money.  Later, I went back up and asked what the charges were for and she basically blew me off and said to call my insurance company.  

The whole thing left a VERY bad taste in my mouth.  I wanted to leave, but they already had my money.  I've still not been able to figure out why I was charged that much, and up front.  I'm waiting on my insurance claim sheet to come back to me and hopefully that will explain it.  But, the reviewers on here that had issues with incorrect, almost fraudulent billing are making me even more nervous.  Even if it's billed correctly and I did owe that money, they made me feel like the money was all they cared about and that I should just 'pay up' and shut up.  I'll never go back to this place, even if the charges were correct.  It's not worth feeling like I'm getting screwed over and having the added stress of their bad attitude during an already stressful illness.  Someone needs to train those front desk workers -- they're an insult to the public.90 minutes for a scheduled oil change and counting.  The Fiat is a lot of fun but this place is just so poorly organized I would not do it again.DO NOT GET GLASS HERE! I called this company a week in advance hoping they could fix my window. The repair man came over and dropped my old broken window. He made an effort to clean it up but when he left my dog managed to cut his foot on the shards of glass that was left. Out carpet even has blood stains. Anyways the repair man dropped another window in his truck so he told me he couldn't install my new window today cuz that was the last one. I asked if he could just come back to fix it because i was waiting for 4 hours for him. He didn't want to make the "long drive."  I called the Glas Teks phone number hoping for some help or maybe a different repair man. The only thing they said was to wait till the next day. yeyy another night in the cold for me! I called a different local company and it was $20 cheaper. DONT GO THROUGH GLAS TEK!Waited 2 hours on a quoted 30 min wait and still wasn't taken back. Service was rude and I will never return or recommend to anyoneWent there today with my kids the manager was so rude and could careless what the food looks or tastes like. The teriyaki chicken is always burnt after they chop it up they leave the scraps on the counter.  I went to use the restroom only to discover that the toilet would not flush thank goodness I only had to pee! When I mentioned it to the manager she just shrugged it off. This place is an embarrassment to our neighborhood! !Screw this place.  I had a groupon for mani, pedi, and mini facial and I called to schedule it today (June 15) and she told me they are booked on weekends until August 6.  My groupon expires August 4 and she just said 'well, we're all booked, we can call if there's a cancellation."  The next weekday appointment they had wasn't until July 8.  Ridiculous!This place sucks! It looks like a family is running this store. My boyfriend and I went in and instead of having the normal shredded lettuce that they normally have, we had big, chunky, bitter romaine lettuce that they probably had just bought from a grocery store that morning because they ran out. 

Another time we had drove to the drive thru to order and no one came on. We had to call the store to let them know that we were outside waiting for about ten minutes. 

They also make the sandwiches very sloppy and lack on the toppings given. And the workers usually have an attitude. The manager/owner is the most greediest with the sandwiches and will not cut you the correct sized sandwich. Barely enough meat to even go across the bread. 

Overall, this place is trash. Don't go there. You'll be disappointed in your sandwiches.Ordered for delivery and never received my order. The person working at the time that I checked on it didn't know what happened. This was 2 hours after I ordered. The time that I tried their good for pick up it was overly greasy and soggy.I'm gonna change my previous review.

I wouldn't recommend anybody to do any business with this company.

I'm still trying to get my money back! I'm thinking about closing my credit card because they already charged me twice.

I call them and they just ignore me. I write them and they just ignore me.

It seems like this company is trying to make money charging their clients extra money and hoping that they'll just ignore it.

Have a look at Better Business Bureau:

You can also google something like "Fox Rent a car charged me again" or "Fox Rent a car did not return my security deposit" and you'll be surprised how many people had the same problem.I gave it one star because this is the shadiest company I have ever rented from. We waited over an hour on a Friday night. I understand being busy with the public but why would you have only 2 over worked employees checking in customers.
They were very polite and friendly.
When I got the car, they checked all over for damage which was good, but the marked the gas tank full and it was only 1/2 full. In the building they have signs all over that say 'don't fill the tank, no worries we will fill it for you and save you .20 a gallon.' THEY LIE They charged me 5.00 a gallon and they said they had to use 11 gallons. The car has a gas tank that full is 14.5 gallons. The tank was almost to half.
I will never rent from here again,  and neither will my family, as my Niece and her husband had the same problem the same day.Companies that expect hardworking Americans to take the day off from work to wait for them to fix our appliances and then not show up or phone are the type of companies that make Americans look bad.  We scheduled with Avalon because of an extended warranty purchased through Lowe's.  The first appointment was a 4 hour window in the morning.  15 minutes before the end of the window, they called to say they would not be able to make it and rescheduled.  The second appointment was a Saturday 3 hour window in the middle of the day.  They never showed up and didn't call.  How can a company from Las Vegas servicing what they claim to be 500 zip codes not get it right?My boyfriend took my car to get it washed and smog at this location since I have been here once before and they do an awesome job with detailing and cleaning the car. They were even able to vacuum up all the dog hair on my seats.

But after today, I'm having second thoughts about bringing my car back here since the guy driving from the end of the wash to the detailing section handled it like he was in some Ken Block Gymkhana video.

The employees should treat these cars with the same respect as they would expect if it was their car. What if he had hit someone or something? What if my boyfriend wasn't standing outside and didn't see him do this? How many other cars has he done this to? This behavior is completely unacceptable.

The employee got the tongue lashing he deserved but the dollar tip was way too much gratitude for his lack of service.Bad service and worse wings. The so called hot wings taste like nothing but vinegar, the mango habanero are a poor attempt to copy BWs, and the boneless are like a cheap frozen brand but not as good... Don't waste your time or money here.DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY!!  Rude and very unprofessional.  The accounting department is so unorganzed that they continue to mail you invoices, hopeing one will slip thru fpr a dup payment.  They do not show up for appointments and when they do they take about 10 days.  I strongly recommend not useing this horriable company.  This was a nice family owned company before new owners bought it, and completely trashed their name.  Also known as Seacoast Garage doors.Took a Nellis Cab from the Luxor to the airport. The driver was fairly curt. When we arrived he was annoyed we would need a receipt, and told us our 26% tip was cheap and refused to make change. He suddenly found himself with a 10% tip, at which point he called my husband a "fucking dick" and peeled out. Classy guy.Today we drove across town with our two kids and arrived during their posted hours of operation. We were turned away and asked to return twenty minutes later because there was a party in session. I understand that this type of place hosts parties, but I didn't appreciate being turned away. The parking lot was full of federal government vehicles (on a Sunday) which is an obnoxious waste of taxpayer dollars.DO NOT take your pet here. Worst place EVER to take your pet. Our dog recently got shaved there and we are now at the vet checking for burns or other infections, because his behavior has been completely different since his grooming. WORST PLACE EVER!!!!! If you want to have your dog be in pain then go here. If you don't want to feel bad for him or her the days after then go somewhere else!!!Terrible,  we called to make a reservation and were put on hold after waiting for 5 minutes we hung up and called back.  This time we went to the voicemail which directed us to leave our name and number for  a reservation,  which we did. We left name (spelled out and number) as well as the time we wanted. We never received a call back but shouted forThe reviews about wait time are all correct. Waiting an hour to be seen? Why did I bother showing up on time? I'm glad I'm moving.Ok, so my reference point is Little Tokyo in L.A.  

I ordered an ahi salad and a Soporo.  Trying to do the healthy thing.  The salad simply didn't have flavor and was over priced at $15 and my beer was $10!  But I can live with this..maybe it costs more to transport to the AZ.  Like whatever, im a grown up.

What killed me though was the service.  My salad was forgotten..but ok it happens....but it still arrived before my beer! Which I had to ask about.      So..the waitress finally checks on me then I ask her for the check...to get things going I just hand her my credit card.  And sigh, you can guess the rest.  After 15 min  i have to walk up to the register to settle. Rrrrrrrrrrrr

Positives is that this place is a magnet for cute girls, which at least can take your mind to a happy place while waiting in purgatory. Also the manager followed up quickly.

So next conference I will stick with the hotel restaurants which have been good thus far and fair prices.This NOT based off of the food... BECAUSE WE WEREN'T ABLE TO TASTE IT. 

So, I heard about the Slider Truck and I immediately looked up the reviews and checked the schedule, since they're only in certain location at certain times, and the next closest location was going to be behind the Yogurtland on Flamingo and 215 this past Saturday, but I totally forgot about it until we were driving by and saw him in front of Massage Nirvana on Fort Apache in between Trop & Peace Way. Yea... That's NOT the location that was listed, 1st WHOOPS. 

We turned into the parking lot because I really wanted to try the sliders, I mean, how many places have you seen that have 4 1/2 stars? So we park and as soon as we walk up to the line and a guy that was waiting for his food, said that the Slider Truck ran out of food. WTH?! WHOOPS NUMERO DEUCE. 

I was really disappointed because he's not really on this side of town very much, at least from the looks of his schedule, and the photos look so good and a lot of the reviews were raving about the sliders. AND the schedule isn't updated til last minute. I checked his schedule yesterday, for today and it wasn't posted when I checked at 8pm last night. 

I STILL WANT to try your sliders Mr. Slider Truck... But some consistency as to where you're going to be and enough food for your fellow Las Vegans would be awesome :)AZ Best On-Time Movers damaged and scratched several of our furnishings.  I am not unreasonable and understand that accidents happen;  However they would not return my calls or do anything to resolve the issues.  Truly horrible customer service.Went to see Robert Cray.  He didnt play very long.  I would never waste my money to see him again.  Husband is the fan and he agrees that it was a little disappointing.  People behind me were pure A Holes pissed off that we arrived and put an end to the little window they had.  The A Holes would not shut up about it.  I controlled myself and said nothing which is unusual.  When concert was over we went to casino and put $80 bucks into a machine that sucked it right up.  No wins just pure losses.  Went to the Blue Coyote Cafe.  Not impressed.  I had mac and cheese it was bland and tasteless.  Husband had spinach salad.  Said it was the worst spinach salad that he had ever had in his lifetime.  He literally took 2 bites and was done.  Waitress asked how it was and I said he didnt like his salad.  She just laughed at me.  I told her it was not funny and that he didnt eat it.  She laughed again and walked away and brought us the bill.  She didnt take the uneaten salad off.  Husband pays bill and I am beyond pissed so I ask for manager.  I wait.  and I wait.  Then I wait some more.  Finally I told the girls at front what happened.  They understood.  They tried to get manager so I waited and I waited til I said forget it I am out.  Huge waste of my time and money that night.Oh my...one word terrible. Went to Calico jacks on Mother's day. First, the service was horrible. It's like the waitress didn't want to work. No drink refills, no one even came to check on us. For all they know we could have left and they wouldn't haven't cared. Second, food was terrible, no flavor. Last the drinks, if I order a drink and you don't have the mixing ingredients, don't try to make something just come tell me. Drinks were horrible. Will not go back. If I was the owner I would fire everyone and start over.I bought a Groupon for this place for my sons car, WOW was I surprised on all the up charges they hit me with.   The 2000 VW Golf has two very small triangle windows in the back passenger doors, they wanted $35 to tint these two windows.  I only paid $70 for the Groupon in the first place.   There was old window tint on the windows and they told me it was $85 an hour to take the old tint off.  Who knows how long that would have taken. Then, when I asked how much the first tint up grade was, they quoted $125 plus the $70 for the Groupon!!!  He told me if I just drove in the fee to tint all 7 windows with the upgrade tint was $150 making the Groupon more costly then just driving in!!!  The guy "Clint" actually told me this!!!!  Stay away from this place, I would recommend Green Valley Tint just mile or so away!With about as much ethnic diversity in store as you'd find in the Nuremburg rallies, Jack Wills is the clothing you wear if you feel the need to proclaim to the world 'I am a complete, and utter, cock'.

Also it's expensive.This was one of the worst restaurants I have been at in a long time. The sangria tasted like dishwater, my lamb was overpriced and tasted like it was thrown up and my dates pork was overcooked. The only thing to possibly make this night any worse was the only time I saw my waiter was to bring my bill and apologize for "forgetting about you guys." 

DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. There are TOO MANY better restaurants in the area.

YUCK YUCK YUCK!!We ordered chicken cheese steak, philly cheese steak, chocolate milk shake and chicken tenders kids meal. Came to about $45. The cheese steaks were edible at best. Chocolate milk shake was too sweet and just not great, for $6.95 i could have made a better one at home. The kids chicken tenders were over fried and tough. Overall good place for tourists to waste money but for people who live in Vegas go elsewhere.  We should have gone to California Pizza Kitchen next door. Good eating!Food was slow & not very tasty. The peppermint shake advertised tasted nothing like peppermint & cost $7.95!! I expected a thick, creamy, heavily flavored peppermint shake. Nope. Thin, lumpy vanilla flavored. Not worth it at all! Plus it wasn't ready by the time our food was at the table but weren't told it was still coming.  We just assumed they forgot to make it & looked for the waitress to ask.  She hadn't brought my friend's ice tea either. When she finally came over she had forgotten the tea but the shake was still being made.  When my friend said at this point just cancel it she immediately brought the tea.  We had a $12 Groupon & they had to remove the nice military discount on order to use a groupon. Food too expensive for its lack of taste & quality.  My first & last time to Johnny Rockets.Very mixed feelings about this place.  One criticism about this place is to shape up security.  There was one crazy aggressive partygoer who assaulted my friend, not once but twice- also he grabbed me and ripped my dress.  I fell on the floor yelling for someone to call secuirty and nothing.   eventually i had to find someone.... after some searching we found him and security said they couldnt kick him out.  my friend should of filed a police report, she even had a bruise on her mouth the next day.  

surrender is like a smaller xs. its newer and flashier, literally with flashing lights lining the area around the pool.

 My friend got a cabana here so there was a very short wait, and plenty of drinks and it was very comfortable.  The Cabana is airconditioned and has its own private bathroom.

The venue is nice, however I don't feel safe at this club and if I did go again I would stay very close to my cabana/table and NOT venture to the dance floor.  There are alot of really bad people out there.  be carefulWe were a group of friends visiting Las Vegas and decided to celebrate our Christmas Eve night at the Surrender. 

While waiting in the line one of the girls in our group stepped out of the line momentarily and one of the guys followed her; the whole thing took two or three minutes but when they tried to come back to the line one of the staff (a very tall, white guy in suit) educated them that "people who just arrive need to go to the end of the line" I tried to explain they were already in the line and the staff told me to mind my business because he wasn't talking to me; a total stranger/bystander who might even been an employee tried to intervene but she was also hushed by the angry staff. These all wouldn't have felt as bad if the tall white guy  didn't have a horrible attitude and didn't come across so rude and judgmental. We called our friends who were heading there too and let them know what happened and we all headed to Haze Club instead. 

There were 15 of us total and just the cover charges  for the entrance would have totaled around a grand of revenue for the club.I would never, ever write a review about a place I have not been until now.  My parents went to The Groves today and were so upset about their experience (and they do not use yelp) that I had to share the lack of customer service and terrible experience they had.  

When my mother got her roast beef sandwich, it had a greenish tint to it.  After research the USDA website: http://www.fsis.usda.gov/factsheets/Color_of_Meat_&_Poultry/index.asp#10 

I found this can happen with that type of meat.  My mother was not aware of this but was completely disgusted. She told the server took her plate away. When she returned, she said the chef would not and had not touched it because she should be grateful that his knives are so clean and sharp that it actually oxidized the meat.  After reading the USDA website, this does not seem to be the case.  My mother was so grossed out she said she had lost her appetite.  The server did not even apologize and gave her some attitude.  When the bill came, they even charged them for it. My  parents did not raise a stink, they just left their money and will never be back. I worked in the industry for almost 4 years, anyone with half an ounce of customer service skills would have taken the food away, offered something different, and/or taken it off the bill or at least discounted the bill.  Instead of trying to do guest recovery they chose the "I know better than the customer" road and have a bad yelp review, two people  who influence a lot of diners in the area who will speak poorly about the place, and a frequent AZ visitor who will never go to this place.  All for what?  A few $$ and some swallowing of price. Oh well, plenty of other great places to eat in AZ.Passage to India is just another curry house serving up dishes with muddled flavors that won't excite you.  Paratha was a bit dense and came to the table when I was half way through my curry.The name just about says it. The place should be kept a secret to avoid a big mistake by going there and wasting your money.

A groupon came available and my wife and I jumped on it since we enjoy Mexican and we see this place every time we head to the store further down Chandler. 

Since we had a groupon, we had to make a reservation. We arrived and still had to wait about 10 minutes to get seat. Not a good start. We were greeted, informed the server we had the groupon and told we can't use the groupon for the taco special. We didn't plan on it since we rather have entrees, but noted.

We ordered the chips and guacamole and were pleased with the dish. Very good!

I ordered the combination plate, 2 enchiladas, rice beans and a taco.  My wife had the fish taco plate. When my food arrived, my enchiladas were dry, bland and the worst enchiladas I've had in my lifetime.They were awful and couldn't envision anybody liking them. Enchiladas should be flowing with sauce and meat and cheese. These enchiladas were anything buy. The beans tasted they came out of a can. Hard and not flavorful Rice was okay. The taco was the best thing on the plate and that was really average at best.  

I wasn't looking for much, just good mexican food! You won't find that here!

My wife's order came with just the tacos. No rice no beans. Took many minutes to correct the problem.  I was able to get a refill early, but my wife never got her water refilled. She was never asked checked after the food arrived. We tried to flag down our server with no luck. 

The check took a long time to get to us. Overall, the service was poor. The server may have been new, but even the basic servers tasks weren't done well.

A general observation was the owner/manager was going around and talking with others that he seemed to know. Take a second and stop by a new person/table and get real feedback. I would have had a few helpful suggestions.

With all the issues around this place, food and service, do yourself a favor and go somewhere else.  There are many places in the area that serve better food!Ok I come into this Einstein at least on e. Week and every time I come In here a gentlemen named Rubin is insanely rude!!! Weather it's to costumers or staff. He is a jerk.  Well today he snapped on me and It pissed me off. I asked a simple question about a promotion and he got all sorts of snappy with me so I walked to the other end and proceeded to pay for my food. Well I paid for my food and 5 minutes later after sitting there he goes oh heather I'm sorry we don't have turkey u can have ham or chicken. Wtf?!? What if I didn't want that? Which I didn't but at that point I was already running late to work so I said chicken. Well already annoyed. Well I went to get Lemon aid and of course the lemon aid came out foggy and with fizz LEMON AID DOESNT FIZZ!!! So I left and when I got to work I was even more pissed. First it was suppose to be on a everything bagel thin. Nope on a regular bagel and I asked for toasted...guess what...not toasted. The lettuce was all soggy and old and the sandwich was gross! 


I'm so sad because I love this place but I will be going into complain and talk to the manger.It tasted horrible. I would never eat there again. Their so called fried rice, wasn't really fried at all.I was really hoping for a nice little liquor and wine shop that would save me a trip to Total Wine on occasion. 

What I found was a small store that isn't as stocked as the local Smith's store. And the prices at Smith's are much better. 

What is interesting is this store has a website that shows rows of shelves stocked full of a variety of liquors and spirits. They must have used pictures from somewhere else because this place didn't have a fraction of the pictured bottles. And the bottles they did have were some of the most expensive retail prices I've seen in a long while. 

To be fair, I didn't try any of their deli sandwiches. But I was on the way home and keep telling myself I'd stop in one day. And when I finally do, I'm sorry I did. I'd even go to a Lee's before I'd go back here. And I've sworn off the crappy service and deceptive pricing practices of them for good. I definitely will not be stopping back here again.Latest joint on Brak's "AVOID" list.  I should have known - seeing the word "bland" about 3 times when skimming reviews should have been a huge red flag.  We had a fairly long wait on a Saturday evening before finally getting seated.  The service was slow and inattentive.  The food was overpriced.  I had fajitas, and it was WAY low on meat (chicken) compared to the other ingredients, despite the high price, and was bland as hell.  Your basic chain restaurant serves far better fajitas than this crud, for less.  Add in the wait time and glacial service, and this place was a huge disappointment.  You've been forewarned.Jack Wills but for richer kids and about twice the price.

Avoid, like the people that wear this stuff avoid the poor.If you go here, I recommend paying cash, but if you must use plastic, especially debit, watch the transaction closely and definitely get your receipts. Also, check your statements if you often patronize the place. If you are not careful this character will bill you double.Absolutely a terrible airline. My advice don't fly with them, choose a cargo plane before you pick them.
They make you pay for everything, icluding your carry on bag and 1 checked bag, their customer service reps are rude and unhelpful. 
Flying with this airline was u huge stress and waste of money.Stay as far away from this nightmare restaurant as possible!  We were excited by the prospect of a good Greek restaurant in Scottsdale but from the minute we walked in we knew this place would suck.  The decor makes you feel like you are at a really bad family event like a wedding or Bar-Mitzvah.  To say the place feels cheap is an understatement.  The white drapes look like something that was purchased at a second hand store and were probably made by a grandmother who passed away in the '80s.  Also, the strands of beads that are supposed to cover the waitress stand make you feel like there could be pot sales going on right back there. 

We asked for a table as far away from the terrible Sinatra impersonator as possible at which time the hostess commented that we might actually be able to have a conversation if we stayed far away but unfortunately you can't get far enough away from him unless you drive out of the parking lot.  Additionally, the synthesized keyboard and scratchy microphone even furthered the feeling of being at a bad family event.

We ordered cocktails quickly but it took about 30 minutes from them to arrive (extremely watered down) to the table.  I then ordered the Greek spaghetti which I think only a horse would like given it tasted like a huge salt stick.  My wife ordered the chicken pita with no onions - it took again about 30 minutes for the food to arrive and my wife was horrified to find raw chicken in a pita with just lettuce and the "side Greek" salad was lettuce drenched in dressing even though the menu said the Greek salad had the normal items such as tomatoes, feta and cucumbers.  We tried to send the sandwich back when it then took another 20 minutes to get a new sandwich which honestly looked like an entirely different menu item - chicken in a pita with raw tomatoes and onions with a Greek salad that actually had vegetables on it however it also had a TON of onions we decided we had enough and asked for the check and left.

With so many great restaurants in Scottsdale and Phoenix we are amazed that such a bad one would even try to open.  It felt like the owner of the restaurant was trying so hard to make it seem like the restaurant was "classy" but in the end it came across as extremely cheap and of course the raw chicken didn't really help.  We will not only never go back but we may not even be able to drive into the parking lot!The ladies that came were nice enough. I was very hopeful for this company, but sadly disappointed, 
The cleaning was ok. I could have done better. I swept up after them and still found lots of dirt. They sent a teenager to clean and she kept stopping to take phone calls. They forgot some of my blinds, and my floors was not too clean after vacuuming. 3 hours with 2 people cleaned 2 1/2 bath ,kitchen and blinds. It doesn't sound like a lot. Never using them again.I admit, I have a coffee addiction and I frequent Starbucks daily.  I recently started going to this store when my job moved to this side of town. I only went here for a week because I almost always received the most unfriendly service at this store. There are a couple baristas here that are amazing, but the attitude from others is enough for me to have started going to the Warm Springs and 215 store.Too loud
Over rated
Over priced
Food was bleh
Drink was weak

You wait 30-40 minutes for nothing!so is it me or does the place only attract the last rung of the food chain.......there is always like some reject that couldn't get into walmart there. or some other poor soul that most likely does not own a mirror cause they would not of left the house if they did looking that way. 
i only went there cause i was told by someone that the place had cheap clothes....well they failed to mention the socially inept cashiers, or the fact that the place looks like a tornado went thru it, or that the house wares looks like a garage sale..... the place is dirty, unorganized, and down right depressing to go into....if you like sorting thru a mass of crap. then go there.I love Ross but not this particular Ross. rude staff, will not be returning. be come here twice & get rude service. they try to kick you out of the stores as soon as it hits the 9:30 mark & they are obnoxious about it, laughing with other employees. I was already even in the checkout line & they were still going on about it! I got so mad i just left my full cart in the line & left, I will not put up with these childish people no longer. their racks are never full anyways & seems like they never organize anything. very sloppy. I will continue to go to the one in Arroyo Crossing.This place is AWFUL. They never get your order right and last time I was there they tried to tell me it was $27 for 12 rolled tacos. You've got to be kidding me. They charge extra for everything and their hot sauce bar is disgusting. Not even drunk food worthy.Jasmine is a horrible admissions rep also. Do not attend this facility. This admissions rep made an appointment with me, changed the time without nofitying me and then expected me to wait for 45 minutes for her to come out and talk to me. The receptionist called her to see if she could talk to me because I was leaving but Jasmne said she was with students and too busy to break away. So I called her back on the number she called me from...she answered the phone!! Too busy to talk to a prospective student...but she can answer her cell phone. Poor, poor, poor representation for an admissions counselor.What is the hype about this place?  Located in a strip mall with a lot of parking, this place has about 6 regular tables and 6 bar tables that use high chairs.  I was going to order the chicken fried steak, but the server said it's frozen and then fried.  I asked about the corned beef hash being made scratch, but it's out of a can.  I asked if they make their biscuits from scratch and the server said "I think so.".  I was alarmed.  I went with the Kaluha pork eggs benedict with the seasoned potatoes.  Very disappointing. The potatoes are just deep fried potato cubes.  No bellpepper and onions.  The pork was smokey and just okay.  My sister had the loco moco. The gravy was bland.  The hamburger patties had a good flavor.  We also had a short stack of buttermilk cakes.  They were okay.  Nothing I would write home about.  140+ Yelpers averagin 4.5 stars really had me puzzled.  The food isn't made from scratch.  Frozen and canned just don't get me in that 4.5 star mood.  Spam is the only canned item I would accept only because you know it's canned.  Corned Beef Hash doesn't mean it's canned unless they say Hormel Corned Beef Hash.Absolutely terrible! Takes forever just to get seated even when there are plenty of open tables. They have 1 moron waitress wearing dirty pajamas,no busser or hostess. Food is marginal at best. They mess up the order and don't even care. And theres also some huge fat slob (I think the owner) who just sits there an eats and doesn't help seat people or do anything about the fact that te place is totally understaffed. Looking at the owner alone is enough to make someone lose their appetite. I'll never go back to this place!I agree with the previous reviewer. It seems like a great concept but not executed well. It seemed barely surviving when I went in there with a few token scrawny pieces of organic produce, but the rest was pretty much stuff I could find at any grocery store. Cans of Coca Cola? Really?This location always has a ridiculously long line out the door.  You'd think they were going into a niteclub.  We had some comp dollars to burn and for some reason both Baja Miguel's and Primarily Prime Rib had 45 minute waits to be seated.  Hell, even the Coronado diner and their terrible buffet had a wait.  

SOOOOOOO..welcome to "plan E".  

We opted for the takeout line and to eat at one of the booths by the sportsbook.  Still had to wait about 20 minutes for our order.  The shakes the servers kept walking by us with looked freakin awesome but I didn't feel like drinking 800 calories and 70g of fat.  "Save it for the burger" I told myself. 

Finally sit down ready to eat and were pretty disappointed at what dinner looked like.  It didn't get any better after the first bite.  The patties were thin and dry and the fries had no seasoning on them.  What a total waste of calories and fat.  Whoppers taste a million times better than this.    

What the hell am I missing??  Why would anyone spend an hour in line for this crap let alone 20 minutes?  Where is the STEAK in Steak n' Shake?  I'd rather eat frozen chicken nuggets.The waiting time for Thanks Giving dinner was 3 hours. We were starving going in at 8:15pm but the foods were running low. They ran out of sushi and only had 4 types of rolls which had no flavor due to driness of each ingredients. Crab legs were only available with unopened portion of legs. Bone marrow wasn't even available until 9:30pm when I stuffed myself with mediocre flavor food. $50 sure was over priced for such service.Don't believe the hype! Way over crowded! Even during the week. Waaaaaaaay over priced! It's on the strip to be expected. Security puts the ass in asshole. Every time I've  been I've had a problem with security being twads. Who ever designed this place A:doesn't have a vagina, B: doesn't like any one with a vagina.! Putting 5flights of stairs in a super crowded club and then wanting scantily clad women in sexy shoes to come to said club is the STUPIDEST thing ever!  It's dark and confusing.Does a person have to be dead in order for justice to take place when a homophobic hate crime occurs?

Over President's Day weekend, I went to a nightclub in Las Vegas, Nevada with my cousins.  On the evening of February 17th I was brutally assaulted and threatened by the security guards of Marquee Nightclub & Dayclub in The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas.  This is my account of what happened in its entirety, the police are not helping me, and did not provide me with an official copy of a notarized police report.  I do not know what to do and hope that justice can be served through the local news stations to gain awareness.

On February 17th between the hours of 11:45 P.M. to 12:15 A.M., Mr. Nguyen was a visiting patron of Marquee nightclub of The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas, Nevada.  Mr. Nguyen was asked to leave when a Marquee security guard noticed a flask on him.  The guard was African American 5'6", with short curly black hair and a wide forehead.  Mr. Nguyen was compliant and attempted to leave Marquee with his cousins, however, the security guard did not allow Mr. Nguyen's cousins to leave with him.  The security guard called for "Elevator 4" to be ready, as well as "backup."  Mr. Nguyen was violently thrown into the elevator with four additional security guards - all were tall, Caucasian males, over 6-feet with shaved heads and beards.  As the elevator door closed, Mr. Nguyen yelled for his cousins to call for help and call 911.  When the elevator doors closed, Mr. Nguyen was choked and threatened by the security guards.  The security guards repeatedly said to Mr. Nguyen "You are a fag that likes to be choked," and "I am going to give it to you in the ass and that you are going to like it." They also said that Mr. Nguyen wouldn't remember anything after they were done with him.  The guards took turns beating Mr. Nguyen until he became light-headed and lost consciousness.  After some time, the same group of guards woke Mr. Nguyen.  Mr. Nguyen had been carried to the ground floor of the The Cosmopolitan and his face was covered in blood, Mr. Nguyen had a red ring around his throat from being choked and there was blood on the floor around him.  The guards wiped blood off of his face and asked Mr. Nguyen if he remembered anything.  The guards asked Mr. Nguyen why he was in the corner of the hotel and said that they would call their paramedics.  Mr. Nguyen was fearful of being beaten again, so he communicated that he did not recall anything.  The guards took Mr. Nguyen's identification card and spent approximately 15 minutes writing down all of his information including his current home address. Mr. Nguyen returned to meet his cousins and attempted to file a formal complaint and police report.  The Las Vegas PD replied that there was nothing they could do because there is no evidence, even though there were security cameras in the elevator and hotel.  The Las Vegas PD officer said that Mr. Nguyen could have been responsible for his own injuries.

Please help me by making this story known to the general public.  There cannot be injustice like this in the world and no consequences for such hateful acts of violence.Our first vist several months ago was grim. The lobster was chewy, the frozen fries are dreadful and the bisque was nothing like I have ever tasted. And I am from New England. But as we do, we always give restaurnts 2 trys to make sure that it wasn't an off service. We visited this weekend and it was worse that we expected. Lunch time and no one in the restaurant. The fried scallops were cold and fried in oil that needed filtering. The boiled shrimp were very small and fishy smelling. Both of these apps. were served on chopped pieces of wilted lettuce. But with a lovely novelity cut lemon wedge. They would be much better served spending time preparing good food and less time making carved lemon wedges. We had lobster salad rolls.Chewy pieces of lobster and an odd taste. We both got through about 1/2 a roll and could go no further. We got about 20 mins away from the restaurant  we both began to get ill. We both stayed ill for a day. It has been years since I have had food poisioning but once you have had it, you do not want it again I can assure you. We naturally will not be returning but we are so shocked by the positve reviews. Where did these people eat?This has to be the worst restaurant in Las Vegas! To start with, I think it's the only  italian restaurant I've ever been to  that charges you for mediocre bread. The portions are a joke and incredibly overpriced considering how small and uninteresting they are. I ordered the chicken which was the smallest chicken I've ever seen. It tasted average at best, and I was still hungry after dinner. The waiter was reluctant to give us breadsticks (made it sound like he did us a favor swiping them off the bar) and we paid $5 for "stromboli" bread which was average at best. 
Everyone who works there seems unhappy and look like they don't want to be there, and the overall experience was awful. If I could rate it a zero I would. The entire experience was unpleasant, food unsatisfying, terrible menu, broken pizza over and apathetic service. I would never return and suggest you don't go either.This place is nice and clean, but it is not as described. It is not a foot massage place!  I went here last night for an intense foot massage. I scheduled my visit ahead of time and indicated I wanted an hour long foot massage. Well I received a 10 minute foot massage that was not intense along with some weird back rub. The rub really did nothing for me. I was so disappointed that I didn't want to tip, but did so because I felt it was the right thing to do. Therefore, if you want a good foot massage go elsewhere. If you just want an Asian to touch you go here.the owners are rude and awful.  They think they own the shopping center and they do not, the send people away, which is good, who wants to shop there anyway.  Great people that I know will not ever go to this place.  They would rather go to TOYS R US OR BABIES R US, which are cheaper and management and these stores are nicer.First let me just start off by saying, I do not write yelp reviews unless Im extremely disappointed. I've been to Sugar Factory several of times, but this last visit will have been my last. It use to be my favorite restaurant, when I lived in Las Vegas and then also when I was just a visitor from out of town. We got a Groupon $25 for $50, which was a great offer because its very overpriced. We made a reservation for 8:30pm but went over about 8:00pm to see if they could get us in sooner. We went through the entrance from inside Paris and the young kid at the front desk was just so rude. He walked us through to the front host and I noticed there was a table open in the bar area (which is open seating) and he gave us a hard time for that. We stood and waited for 5 minutes for him to talk to the front hostess when anyone could have just walked in and grabbed the table. Once we were seated, it took about 10 minutes to even be approached. The server clearly couldn't handle her section which was not even terribly busy. About 30 minutes after being there we finally got our WATERS. We ordered all of our food at once to help the server out since she looked overwhelmed. We got the food and let me just say, that was the first time Ive ever had such horrible food there! Sugar Factory is constantly changing the menu and its starting to get annoying. I ordered the crispy buffalo which was horrible, i was hoping for the buffalo wings they use to have. I also ordered the bbq chicken pizza which was dry, i had to drench it in ranch. The server didnt come over one time to check on us while we were there, I had to constantly keep asking the busser for the extra things we needed. The server finally stopped at our table when I flagged her down, and even then it took 10 minutes to get our check. She didnt offer us ANYTHING until it was time to pay and give her the tip. Ha.Oh my goodness, I will never return here! I am really surprised at how many awesome reviews this place has. First off, the place is on Mill Ave, pretty nice location. The inside was pretty clean but we were unable to sit in the dining room because it was closed? So we had to sit at the bar.

We ordered the cheesy bread and a small cheese pizza. I was extremely excited for this because I love cheesy bread...and it looked so good when it arrived at our table...but ugh it was so average and unappetizing. The pizza arrived fairly quickly but that didn't benefit me at all because it was not good at all. The cheese was so thick that it could choke a horse. But anyways, I give this place 1 star because we had a nice server and they had good lemonade.Don't come here for Valentines X. They lie about the line wait. If it's an two hour wait, just say so. Don't say 15 to 20 mins. Especially not saying it twice when asked. Now add in the same 80's and early 90's songs, about 6 of them. Playing endlessly. How is that haunted? It over all is a waste of money. There is no scare factor or even fun factor here. DON'T GO. STAY FAR AWAY!!!Worst customer service ever we got
Into 25min argument over 3 dollars and they ended up not helping us outThere was no refill. Server was distant and innattentive. Food was burned and when we asked to address an issue we waited for 30 minutes before we left because no one came manager was too busy standing at the bar.Wait staff is completely lacking. Service is so sub par that the clientele is more likely to fall asleep then to be accommodated.I read a complimentary story about this place in AZ Rep so I figured I would  check it out for a refurb. laptop for my father (go local right?) So on a Monday and my day off from work I drove from central Phx to Mesa store only to find door locked at 2:15 pm. I checked the other door which was open and asked the man who was standing there if they were open. All he said was "ya". So I more or less asked if I could come in and he kind of shrugged - he really looked like he did not want me there. So I asked again "are you sure you are open, cause you don't look like it." He kind of sneered at me and said "look it's been a bad day" and he still did not invite me in. So I just said I would come back. He did not say anything and just walked away. Whoa! I get it that people have bad days - I have a few myself but really? I have worked in customer service my whole life, not as an owner but I am sure if I acted this way to my clients, I would be in some serious trouble or fired. Oh well, dad got a brand new laptop from Best Buy. I tried...Make sure you order the day before so get your food in time. If you come at night, expect to wait 30-45 minutes.Disappointed. I ordered the 18 oz. bone in filet as recommended by our waiter versus 8 oz., medium. When the filet arrived, I thought to myself "where is the beef?". Beef was on one side of the small bone. I expected an 18 oz. to have beef on both sides of the bone. I suspect the total weight was at most 10 oz. It arrived cooked rare vesus medium ordered. The lobster tail was luke warm with cold melted butter.

The tasteless bread basket tasted a bit stale, 1 day old with no taste!

Stay away from the sides. The tater tots that our waiter recommended were almost burned. The mac and cheese was worst that gthe box style you get in the store. noodles were well done.

I decided not to complain since we were being taken out by someone else.

We will not go back.This place is run by rude teenagers. The orders take FOREVER, the smoothies aren't very good and if they get your order wrong, they argue with you about what you ordered. Avoid this place!Went there for lunch and had the "Hambagu Steak". It was the worst Japanese Hamburger Steak I've had... absolutely no flavor! That's 1 dish the Japanese have perfected, but Cafe de Japon destroyed it. The Neapolitan Spaghetti was also blah...So as my girls and I were waiting 4 our table @ burGR, we decided to walk around and we were hungry and looking for a snack.  We came upon this place.
Lobster ice cream.  I'm a HUGE fan of lobster (thanks BOSTON!) 
So we ordered a lobster and chips. . . it was over battered and fries were over cooked.
The only good thing was the margaritas.  
Service sucked.  Young girls with attitudes, rolling their eyes @ us.

This will never be as good as the ones in Boston.A friend and I went on a groupon. We were excited to try the DIPPING bar. The tables that we were seated at were more like lounge seats. I didn't see where the dipping came into play because there wasn't any. The price was a little high and the buns on the burger fell apart fast. 

I wouldnt go back unless they brought in small snacks and DIP-ABLE food. I dont expect this place to last too long.On December 29, 2013, a Lucky Kitchen delivery driver nearly bit my head off over his tip. You see, I wanted to give him a $2 tip, but he apparently wanted $3. Here's how it went down: 

When my order arrived, I gave the driver exact change to cover my food. Then, I handed him a $5 bill and asked for three dollars back. Instead, the driver handed me $2, half-assed fumbled through his pockets, and said he didn't have another dollar on him. Calling his bluff, I gave the two dollars back to the driver and I took my five dollar bill back. 

The driver, who usually seems very friendly, became enraged and proceeded to yell, "So, you gonna leave me with nothing?! Over a dollar bill?! Really?!" I explained that his tip was $2 and that if he couldn't give me proper change, I wasn't giving him an extra dollar simply because he didn't have proper change. 

The driver stomped off yelling in his native tongue (probably calling me inappropriate names) and soon returned with enough money to give me the $3 I had requested. 

Once I calmed down, I called Lucky Star to complain about the driver's rude behaviour. The order-taker said the owner would be away for several months. However, the order-taker took my number and promised someone would call me back. I'm still waiting for that phone call. 

No wonder the driver felt so comfortable acting like a jackass... he knows he is not going to be held accountable for his actions. But that's okay, Lucky Kitchen will never get another dime from me.I am thoroughly pissed off with this place.

My boyfriend and I bought 4 tickets for the Halloween party.
Website said the party was till 1 am.
We arrived at 11:30, got our will call tickets, and was told the party was over, and that we needed VIP tickets to get in. 
The website said nothing about this, and we ended up leaving completely disappointed and ripped off. What a waste of time and money!Very disappointed with Enterprise in Gilbert AZ. (Motorplex)Advertised special is $9.99 per day for a weekend rental. I booked it online and received my confirmation number and amount due of $36 thru Monday. An hour later, I receive a call from "Jennifer" (I think that's what her name was) saying that she can't give me that rate because she only has a limited number of cars left and needs to rent them for a higher amount...it would cost me $70 a day instead!!! Seriously?! Isn't that called bait and switch? My company uses Enterprise in California all of the time and the San Diego Airport location gives us great service, I will be sure to tell everyone I know about this! Enterprise- this is unacceptable!!!! One star because I don't want anyone to think it was accidentally not marked.I was so, so excited to finally get to see Elton John, a legend.  Well, I wish I would have discussed the reviews prior to going.  He acted like he didn't want to be there.  He sat at the piano sang a few songs, got up walked to one side of stage, said a sentence, no clue what, walked back to piano sang a few songs, walked to other side of stage, said something again uninspiring, sang again and exited.  One of my biggest things I rate singers by is the way they thank the audience for "giving them their life" and I don't recall him saying thank you to fans, being honored or moved by the music, sharing any kind of intro or story about a song.  He was just very robotic and unenergized.  I have since heard people say he was much worse when they were there including throwing cursing tantrums onstage.  Probably one of my biggest disappointment.  Shania Twain was worse, but I didn't expect greatness from her.  What is it with Caesars and bad, bad entertainers.Went by at 6pm on a Saturday. Sign said their hours were until 9pm that day. Lights out. No one in sight. Whole shopping complex was a ghost town. Not sure if this place is closed for business or if they changed their hours and didn't make the change on their sign.Why would anyone give this place more than 1 star? How is this place even open still? SERIOUSLY?! Ew.

Ok, yes I understand it's Vegas and it's fun. I'll give it that. The gowns are fun to dress up in- they do very well with the theme. That is how they got one star from me.

However, they advertise "taste worth dying for".... WTF are they smoking? There is SO MUCH potential for this place if they had decent food. 

I've had my share of fatty foods. They usually taste better than skinny people food. If all fast food tasted like this, I think the obesity epidemic would be solved. No one would want to eat this crap. 

This place was an embarrassment to fatty foods everywhere. Other places'  fries that are fried in animal fat= amazing. Why? Because they are crispy and delicious. They are fried first in oil and then in duck fat. HAG misses the extra step and just fries their fries in lard in lard. Lard burns at too low of a temperature and cannot "FRY" fries.  HAG fries are limp, soggy, and burned ( AND luke warm). Gross.

The burger... 59 cent dry stale bun + overcooked basically unseasoned meat + bacon that was chewy and luke warm (somehow it was stale too) = disappointment. 

It's not even a tiny bit delicious. It is disgusting and they don't even try. The whole restaurant is constantly advertising how amazing the food is and how it's food worth dying for. No- it's definitely worth avoiding though.Do yourself a favor and DO NOT go there!

This place is a ripped off. Spent $800 on 4 brand new tires with warranty and blah blah blah. Come to find out 2 months later while I was driving out of the state one of my tire had a big bulge on it. Gave them a called since my tires are still under warranty they said they will order me a tire which will take about 2 days. 2 days turned into 6 months! After 20 calls they told me my tires were on back order. Of course you're tire store and you don't have them instock. Thankfully I did have a full size tire to drive on while I waited on my "back order tire" to come in.

At first this place sounds like a promising honest shop. They convinced me that my car need transmission flush, brake fluid flush and another flush which I don't remember what it was. If I do all three jobs I'll get $70 off. Sounds like a great deal so I had them done since it needed to be done anyway. My car hit 100,000 miles , I took my car in for a tune up at my friend's garage. He looked at what my car needed and told me the brake fluid is dirty. How could it possibly be when I just had it done at BIG O????

I work in a restaurant near by, one day I got a phone call from them saying that why do we have our to go menu there since they say no soliciting. I don't know why maybe a customer came in to eat and grab a to go menu then go get their car fix at Big O. The guy on the phone ask me if I can do something like give them a free meal for being "Soliciting" I was like are you kidding me? I'm so done with this place.Go to Manny's on Ind Sch & El Mirage! Soooo much better food & drinxFour of us went to The Fiddler's Arm on a Monday night for dinner. Despite the restaurant being slow, the services was awful! Our drinks took forever as the bartender forgot them. The first two meals came out, and one was slightly cold. Being polite, we said nothing. After those two meals we almost half eaten we were still waiting for the two remaining meals. We went to the bar to find out where the meals were, and were ignored while the daft hostess talked on the phone with her friend. When she got off the phone, she walked away from us, got the two meals and delivered to our table. She acted like the meals had just been cooked, but they were in fact room temperature. Our guess was that she brought out the first two meals, but forgot about the later two. We will never go back!Wow, that sucked.
In summary, don't come here if you plan to eat and drink during the movie.
However, I am really hoping this was an off, off, off night. We were the third and fourth people to sit down and order and over an hour and a half later we STILL had not received our food or drink. Hungry? You bet. Annoyed? Heck yeah. When we cancelled our order (the movie was nearly over) they charged us for all of it. A short discussion (with apologetic and polite staff) resolved that and they gave us free passes, but not sure if we'll use them... maybe I'll give them to someone I don't like.
Other points: Quick ticket purchase, but don't bother coming early, they just line you up in the lobby and make you stand there until a few minutes before the show. The lobby bar staff completely ignores you which just added to the fun of the night. (Vj D.'s review was completely correct.)
The picture and sound was fine. If it was a normal movie theater, we'd have been totally happy. But for what they're promoting and marketing, you might as well go to Harkins and sneak in a mini bottle and a snack.I was really excited for this place, but I ordered food to go and was disappointed with it. I tried calling ahead and placing an order, but the phone number said to try call again later. Called back and it rang, but no answer. Tried my whole way there (10 minutes) and got no answer! Finally got there and ordered and was told 15 minutes. 20 minutes later I was given my red velvet pancakes and was headed back to my grandmas. They didn't put any butter in the bag, only 2 containers of the "cream cheese frosting". The actual pancakes were good, but I had to eat them dry because the "frosting" tasted like melted whipped cream so it was very bland. 

Maybe other stuff is better? Next time I'll try somewhere else!We came with a party of approximately 30. The service was semi decent. They were slow. At my table two of us ordered pub steak medium rare and it came out well done like leather and super salty. The chicken on the Gorgonzola salad was dry. The salad had very little dressing and too much lettuce. Guac was ok and salmon was ok. Overall had to drink to wash down the over priced meal.horrible service. horrible smell., the bathroom had no air freshener. no refills on water?!!?!?!?!?! 

brought in coupon and they still made us pay full price.

no other customers there and the place looks like shit but they have $30,000 security system!?

i now know why everyone hates salvadoriansWas going to order online.. The entire process was such a hassle and in the end I was told I cannot order online.. I guess I can take my business and money elsewhere.. If there was a way to rate with negative stars, I certainly would!!Worst post office ever. Horrible service. One of their carriers "said" they made an attempt to dropoff a package and said we wernt home as I watched from my kitchen window their poor lazy non attempt at delivering our package and not wanting to push the code to get into the gate. So we went to the post office to collect this package and they lost it. No tacking number... No info on the package.. No size, no amount , zip zero nothing. Just said basically it disappeared and they don't have it in the back. Gave us a number to call to claim this package which couldn't even help us due to their being zero information to give them. Went back a second time and basically tried to place blame everywhere but themselves. Still haven't gotten our package and am very tired with dealing with such lazy, incompetent workers.Walmart of sushi! I found a hair in my rolls. If you don't know me, I'm bald. It wasn't mine!  They offered to remake my rolls. What? So I can have another serving of hair?! No thanks. Then when I asked for a refund they said they could give me a credit. What?! So I can return for a second helping of hair! No thanks! This place sucks! They call themselves the Subway of sushi. Does Subway know they're calling themselves that? The safest thing I would order from this place is a bottle of beer and I would make sure you open it yourself.Was told the wait would be 30 minutes. Almost 2 hours later had to leave and didn't even get the oil change that I had come for. Very disappointed In the service, would not recommend anyone to go there with out calling ahead and even then it's a bit shotty.I come to this location frequently before work and order frozen drinks from the machine. Today, I found mold in my cup. Sludgy mold. I think whomever is supposed to be cleaning the machine and/or it's components is NOT doing their job properly. Not to be a drama queen but I WAS sick for 3 days after this. The kids who work there are  super friendly but if you aren't cleaning properly, that's a reason not to hire highschoolers. :( I will not be ordering anything frozen again.MY FIRST and LAST VISIT HERE! Myself and 7 other people stayed at the elara this past weekend for my 21st bday. When we arrived to our 2bedroom suite we fell in love with the amenities and views that we had. My boyfriend and cousin had stayed in a similar suite when it was the PH towers. We also liked that it was so close to the planet hollywood casino and attached to the miracle mile shops. 



Where it all went wrong, our 2nd night at the hotel we were getting ready and had music on, apparently the music was to loud because we had security ( Anthony ) come up and give us our first strike in a rude manner. Seriously we are in vegas and we were using their stereo system maybe they should remove that or adjust to what volume we were able to use.( we didn't have it on max)


 3rd day we called the front desk that we could hear a smoke detecter going off in one of the rooms next to us, they said they would send someone up. We could still hear it a couple hours later. When we came back from our night out we noticed a horrible smell coming from the room next to us. It smelled like a dead animal very unusual and disturbing smell. Two of our guest went to the front desk to tell someone about it. While they went down we had 2 security guards (Samantha) knock on our door and say that there is loud music and we explained there's no music on, then she said loud voices that this was the second strike and all non registered guest will have to leave.  Both security came in the suite and told us who can stay and everyone else had 10mins to gather our stuff and leave. We tried to explain that we had someone down stairs complaining about the smell in the hall way and she just kept saying they were sending someone up for us to start gathering our stuff. At that point I had to wake up my boyfriend and we started getting our stuff together. The room was under my cousins name and while he was at the front desk he was even getting a later check out time, when he came back up and found out what was happening he couldn't believe that some of us had to leave. As we tried to explain stuff to security they would just be rude and tell us we all need to leave now!Luckily we came here on a groupon so we only paid half price. The burgers are nasty tasting! Even my husband, who is not as picky, thinks they were gross. Maybe I am used to chemical and hormone laden beef? Perhaps, but usually when I eat organic dairy and produce it taste better than their conventional counterparts. Not so with this beef.

The shakes were yummy and the fries so-so. Do yourself a favor and skip this place.Hit Genghis few days ago with gf, and three others.  We were planning a "wild and crazy" night of bingo at the Sunset Station since the cash ball bonus was calling my name.  We get to the restaurant at 5:30 - place is busy so we opt to eat in the bar area.  Bingo is at 7 so this gives us sufficient time to go a few rounds , at least that's what we thought.  Bartender was attentive with the drinks, we even got lucky since there was an NFL game on so Happy Hour prices on beer.

Sadly, we get up to the food line and its 10 deep since they only have 1  buffet  line open.  we're told the 2nd line will open soon for the "dinner rush" - we're standing in line at about 5:45 - when does the rush begin ?  6?  7 ? Since the place is packed at 5:30 here's a crazy idea - open the 2nd line !!!

So we get through round one - only complaint on food - they were low on a few items and my usual complaint about the place - small bowls.  When we gave the bowl to the cook he asked if we wanted the food to go - we told him no.

So time for second round - it's 6:15 - we figure we have a 1/2 hour to get our food, eat then hit bingo.  This time, the line is about 15 deep - still only one line of food available - WTF !!!  I ask the guy re-filling to ingredients  who's the manager of the place, and he points to a guy manning the grill  - i'll share my concerns with him later.  In the meantime the line is moving at a snails pace.  And of course, i'm mid way filling my bowl when they OPEN THE SECOND LINE - thanks, thanks a lot !! 

Given time constraints, when they ask if we want it to go, we say yes.  By the time we get our food, we have 15 minute to pay and leave and get to bingo.  While getting our stuff together, i ask the bartender for our bill - put the $$ with 20% tip in the bill folder even though not pleased about the time issue and the BS of only one line.

The manager comes over to ask how everything went - i expressed my disappointment about the one food line - she advises they open the 2nd line when the place gets busy - THE PLACE WAS BUSY WHEN WE WALKED INTO THE RESTAURANT ... nice try ! She then informs us we cannot take the food to go since we got the bottomless bowl. She had to make the smart remark, It's posted in the restaurant - it might be - i didn't see it nor was i looking - THEN WHY HAVE THE COOK ASK IF WE WANT IT TO GO ?  THEY SHOULD ASK IF WE HAVE THE BOTTOMLESS OPTION, THEN ASK ABOUT TO-GO.

If we can't take it to go then bill us for the one bowl option !  Thankfully she agreed, otherwise, i was really going to lose it .  I get the bill folder and pull out the tip.

F U GENGHIS GRILL - YOU'VE LOST MY BUSINESSWhile driving south on the 17, my wife and I saw the Anthem Outlet billboard saying, "Avacado chicken salad $5.00 at Frescas". Wifey says, "hey, that sounds good. Let's stop!"
Big mistake. She orders the salad, I order 2 fish tacos. What could be easier? We order. We wait, and wait, and wait. 1 cook. 1 order taker. 1 manager, standing there in his old faded Levi's, doing nothing...
When our order finally is up, there is only one taco. Order taker says, "I thought you only ordered one". Hmm, I don't think so. When I pull out my receipt, she's right. But I realize I was charged $7.00 instead of $5.00 for the salad. Order taker says, "I'll order you another taco. It will only take 5 minutes." I say sure. After eating my 1 taco I'm thinking this is the worst fish taco I have EVER had. Do I really want another one? I reluctantly wait outside for taco #2 for 15 minutes and then approach the order taker and ask how much longer? They say "Oh he hasn't started it yet. After you walked outside, a bunch of other people came and ordered stuff so he made their food instead of yours. Alrighty then. I guess I'll be on my way. Life's too short. Don't settle for bad food or bad service.
PS. Wifey hated her salad. We continued home and had some nachos and a beer.Yea. This place is a place I wish I had never tried. Tried this when they first opened with a friend of mine from out of town. 


Meat quality was subpar esp for the price of the place. 
I cannot see how this place has as many stars as it does. My guess is that they have not been to a quality shabu spot. I bet I can go to a better place and pay about the same amount with meat that is way better than here. 

I've been around a lot of butchered meat and the meat here is not good. I wouldn't even try their pork or chicken here by looking at their quality of beef.Absolutely the worst service ever!!!  I waited 18 minutes at the drive thru on sunday afternoon/evening.  I was looking around for the camera because I thought someone was playing a joke.   I took a photo of the receipt as well.  Just a happy meal for my son and after the ridicules wait they tried to give me a dr pepper instead of chocolate milk...  wish I could give 0 stars.Just left this place and the steak sandwich was horrible ! The only way your going to be able the eat this is if your hungover! I will not be visiting the place again! YuckThey're super nice until you return something.

I've bought a bunch of lush products, and for the first time, I had a return. I had my receipts and original packaging, but the lady who took my return made it as difficult as possible. She was making statements like, "You used these and now you're returning them?" and "It's so weird that you just bought these and you used so much of it." (The bottle was over half full.) It wasn't what she was saying that bothered me, it was how she was saying it and how loud she was saying it. She was implying that I was a dishonest customer using products and returning them, and she made sure everyone in the store knew it as well. I was appalled. This was my FIRST return.

I called customer service to file a complaint, and they apologized on behalf of the store. They said they would contact the store and that the store manager would reach out to me. 

I never got a phone call back from the store, so five business days after the incident, I thought I'd give them a ring and speak with the manager. The manager hemmed and hawed throughout the conversation and said customer service never informed her of what happened and this was the first time she'd ever even heard of the situation. 

So I described the incident to her, and the manager never even asked who helped me or what the person looked like. Long story short, it was the manager that had taken my return in the first place. Geez, not only was she incredibly rude when I returned something, but now she's lying on the phone saying she had no idea who I was or how I was treated? 

I wouldn't shop here ever again, and I wouldn't recommend it to anybody either.Food was poor for the price.  Service was slow.  Our waiter, Edward, was rude to us and acted as though everything we asked for was an imposition to him.  Will not return.Horrible. Gross food. Worse service. Disgusting drinks. This was my second time here. The first time we came, we got dinner. It was awful. This time, I got sucked in by a buy one get one coupon. How bad could just drinks possibly be, I thought? This was by far the worst margarita I have ever had. And I'm Mexican. The bartender acted like he was doing me a favor, dispensing the putrid concoction from the decrepit Taylor machine... Never again.We were wanting Mexican food and this place was located in the hotel where we were staying....ideal we thought.  It was absolutely terrible!!!  Service was bad and food and drinks totally over-priced.  I got a chicken chimi and the chicken was spoiled.  I took one bite and literally gagged.  My husband is a chef and smelled it and immediately knew it was rotten.  I lost my appetite so did not re-order.  Husbands tacos were tasteless. They did not charge us for my meal but our bill still totaled $50.  A total disaster!!Plastic coffee stir? Really? How about bamboo for a greener alternative.  Shame on you. I will give you your 5 star back next time I m here & find greener utensils.For my negative experience and review I was harassed on Yelp by Duy V. who is obviously associated with B&T Nails in some way as this person recently uploaded photos for the business. That is sad and this person needs to get a life and find something more productive to do other than send me insulting comments that are not true.Service is good. Food is gross, no wonder why its hidden...We recently debated if you'd come back to a place for good food but bad service or bad food and great service. Answer found here - service doesn't win out over bad food. Too salty. Ckn tacos were limp greasy tortillas filled with mashed bland chicken - looked like baby food. Rice dreadful. Chimichanga the size of a small enchilada. Do people really wait in line in so phx for this?  Too many good alternatives to come here twice.  And we're usually pretty forgiving...I had to update this review.  We went last night for our third visit - the first two were great!

The food this time around was disappointing to say the least.  Some of it was bland...and the stuff that wasn't, tasted like something it shouldn't, i.e. - the rice that came on the side with the fajitas tasted like FISH.  WHAT the hell is that about?  The guac tasted like it could have come from a box, it had no flavor at all and was thin except for the chunks of onion and tomato, and the chips just tasted weird.  Our daughter kept commenting on it as well.  If I kid doesn't like something as simple as corn chips, there's something wrong.  Everything was just bland.  The drink was decent...but it stopped there.

Total bummer.  We won't be back.I was in Vegas celebrating my birthday early with my family, my mother really wanted to try the new $17 million dollar Caesars Buffet. We go for lunch and the line was worse than Space Mountain at Disney. We see a sign for a $15 line pass. This by the way is the only dollar amount being marketed in the buffet area. This entire area is a giant fail by the marketing department. There are no prices listed for the buffet. There are no prices listed for the special 24 hour buffet pass. People are getting to the cashier, which at 1pm on a Saturday, there is only one cashier, one cashier - and they are walking away at the ridiculous prices! Caesars, put up marketing materials, tell us how much the buffet costs. I was at wicked spoon and they tell you everything before you stand in line. Tell us the $15 line pass is per person. Tell us that if you come back the next morning, you'll have to pay another $15 to not wait in the line after you've already spent $65 a person plus tax and tip. Well after complaining to the manager, we finally sat down for the buffet. I liked the buffet, the food was tasty. I didn't overeat or go overboard because I was saving my appetite for my birthday dinner. Well, a few hours later, I'm gambling at the Wynn and it hit me. I got really sick to my stomach. I did make it to my bday dinner before I had to leave and spend the rest of my trip and a few min before my flight out in the bathroom. Thanks Caesars Buffet!***This place doesn't deserve ANY star, but I'll put one on in order to complete the review***

This place is effen bullshit!!! They would schedule a reservation one minute before they close. We arrive there on time and they announce they cannot serve us. Their excuse is that it's a computer glitch and they are sorry they can't serve us. Since when do computer glitches make it the customers' fault? NOT OUR PROBLEM!!  Us customers schedule our time before and around the reservation. What is sad is that they can only comp for the next day.  How's about giving us a comp for 20 mins or our next Vegas visit?  Also adding insult to injury, we came at 9:59pm and Yelp says they close at 11:00pm!! WTF is that???

The food is maybe "labeled" the best buffet in Vegas but definitely the WORST customer service!!  All they can say is SORRY SORRY SORRY.  Call me a WAAAH-MBULANCE!  Sorry is never the customers fault!

What a way to ruin the tail end of a Vegas vacation.SUPER SLOW! Never been to such a slow Cafe Rio. There was no one in line, but it too 10-15 minutes to get food. Poorly organized staff.The Grind on Hayden is a disappointing facsimile of the Grind in Arcadia. In Arcadia, my experiences with the Sweet and Spicy burger, peppercorn burger, and mesquite wings were extraordinary. In the Hayden Grind this afternoon, mediocrity reigned as the barbeque burger lacked any essence of barbeque sauce, which was overwhelmed by the bland mozzarella cheese. The mesquite wings which Arcadia served plain were cooked less skillfully @ Hayden and covered with some superfluous orange-colored sauce. The onion rings were pretty good. The beer selection in both places is very good. I thought I had scored big when I purchased a groupon for the grind. Apparently, not so much. I'll drive to camelback next time.I'm not really happy with the results lately. My last visit was absolutely the worst. I washed 3 different loads this time. I noticed for the second time that the machines are not extracting the water from my clothes as well as it could. Most of my things I hang to dry. With that said I dry my towels, linens etc. I usually separate them between 2 or 3 dryers depending the load sizes. This time (my last visit) I spent approximately $4 and my clothes were wet...Not just a little wet, but wet. I told the attendant on duty (female), who was playing on her phone... I told her how much I had put in the dryer and that my clothes were still wet. I also asked if the temperature on the dryers has been altered or need to be altered and she said "no" they were all the same. That did not really answer my question. I've dried quilts and pillows before and they dried just fine, and it didn't cost me $4 to do so. 

So needless to say I will be looking for another laundry. Just so you know this wasn't a spontaneous decision. I drive 5-6 miles to get to this location for the past 10 months for the very reason that I washed and dried my clothes each time to my satisfaction. 

Well, I'm on the hunt for a new place to wash, (clothes that is). If anyone has any suggestions I would be grateful. 

Laundry Lounge, you have lost a once satisfied customer.Didn't even get an adjustment and I'm still disappointed! 

I can't move on a Sunday and them being "open" on Sundays was ZERO help at all. I called to find out if they take insurance or how the process works (I've never been to or needed a chiropractor in my life) and the woman told me if I could be there in 4 minutes then they could see me, since they REQUIRE you to be there 1 hour prior on your first visit. Clearly that isn't gonna happen so I guess they're never getting my business. Help a pregnant girl out, jeez!My one star is not on the food per se. Its on the location.
I don't know who's bright idea it was to come here, and im sure the food might be amazing. We didn't get far enough to try. First off it is very confusing when trying to locate this because its inside the bar. We saw a plack on the wall with the name and decided to go inside and ask someone.

We walk inside and were greeted by 25 black people awkwardly staring at us. I think they were having a party in there because there was loud music and catering. Now I have no problem with that, what I do have a problem with is how everyone kept gawking at us and giving us dirty looks. 

We asked the bartender where the restaurant was and he told us we were standing in it. Ok thats cool, we would have stayed and gave it a shot. But there was no where to sit. So we said F' it and left.

I love hole in the wall places. This comes too close to an actual hole in the wall.This place was awful!  My husband ordered the crab cakes - they were fishy and tasted like they were from a can,  I had the fried catfish.  It was fair - coating was just cornmeal.  Very dry and tasteless.  The sides were also bland - coleslaw was the best although very sweet.  Cornbread was good.  Woman behind counter was extremely unfriendly.  When she brought our meals, served in to-go boxes, she just threw then on the table.   Meals are pricey.   We had a deal chicken and will never return.We had an order delivered by Straight to your door.  The delivery guy called us to tell us he was waiting there and the restaurant was running late.  The food was definitely luke-warm when it got here (I realize this may not be their fault but the delivery guy was doing his best).  And once we got it, it was really terrible!  We had an appetizer of corn sticks (I forget what they were called) and they were way too salty and dry, and then we had Mofongo, which turned out to be a pile of dry stuff - I guess that was the plantains - and next to it a pile of tough nuggets of pork.  Just really disappointing.  Especially because both of us really love plantains and were looking forward to this new (to us) way of preparing them.Youfit is practically impossible to cancel the membership, they will continue to bill you for months and even charge a late fee and have an attorney contact you.  I have been trying to cancel my membership for almost a year but they would not accept my cancellation, they said they needed a longer notice and there was a 25 dollar cancellation fee. Finally I changed my debit card number to keep them from taking funds.  They randomly charge fees whenever they feel like it.  DO NOT SIGN UP UNLESS YOU WANT THE MEMBERSHIP TO CONTINUE FOREVER!  YOUFIT IS A NIGHTMARE!Do not do business with this place. Many current and active complaints with different RE departments due to their lack of ethics and financial/escrow issues. They have our funds but refuse to refund. You will never get your email or calls returned and their invoices are so unclear with no explanation of charges. They will cheat you and nickel and dime you to death. Conduct your own due diligence and you'll see I am not exaggerating! Find a more reliable with better reputation Property Management company. There are still few left!Do not ever use this team of misguided misfits for property management.  They are senile incompetent and incapable.  They managed my property and would never have anything repaired at my request, or my tenets request.  They failed to service my air conditioner after several requests to service it.  This cost me 4000.00 to replace the unit due to lack of service. Nola the owner is a big double talker sales woman who never listens to any thing but rather talks loudly over you to avoid any form of accountability.  She does not document anything. The only thing they do a good job at is billing me and deducting the management  fee from my rent.  I had to fly 2000 miles to go to my condo, coordinate contractors to fix all the repairs and set up a service plans myself.  The story goes on believe me never buy a house from them or use them for property management they are the worst I've ever been associated with.  To date I can not get my tenants down payment returned to her. They are very dishonest.I had a groupon for the express manicure with a vitamin hand massage.  Thank goodness it was only $10 because they normally charge $20 and it's not worth it.  She took off my nail polish, shaped with a nail file (barely) and repainted it which has bubbles in it but at that point I just wanted to get out.  I can get a normal manicure at my nail salon for $12 and they clean, cut cuticles, and a much faster dry time.  I will never go back.DO NOT GO IF YOU HAVE EXTENSIONS!  This girl tossed my hair so much while shampooing it got so tangled and matted. Then even after I mentioned "why don't you just use a detangler" she ripped through my hair with a brush pulling and tugging! She even pulled out like 4 of my extensions! I have the plastic tube extensions (shrinkies) too so they're very easy to wash and style.The only reason they get 1 star is because the wings. This is the most nasty, disgusting and rude place you can sit down n eat. The ppl who horse bet has no respect for other customers. The Russian waitress is a true b****. She rubs me as a racist. The old bar tender finger nails are filthy.  He rubs me as a meth head. The old white lady is for sure a meth addict. PPL SAY NO TO DRUGS N PURPLE TURTLESo after eating here for a going away lunch for a fellow colleague 3people (including myself) have not felt so hot since. Our P.I. In the office did some research and found that this restaurant recently had an surprise inspection from Maricopa county, you should take a moment to read that before you decide to eat here...Wow! I have to say I was horribly disappointed in this place. We went in at 11am on a Friday. They said there was 5 people in front of us. I went in because of a pretty decent car accident and wanted to make sure that there weren't any underlying problems. When we walked in the receptionist was very rude and stated that because I was in a car accident they couldn't do any x-rays. Funny, when my partner went in after a car accident in October they took x-rays. So we waited, and waited, and 7 people went in before us! Then the receptionist calls me up saying she doesn't know where to send the billing. So I make the phone call (isn't this supposed to be her job) get the info walk back up. Nope it's the wrong info! So I call back (again her job) and get the physical mailing address because a fax wasn't good enough along with the name OR  the claim number. But whatever. FINALLY we get called back after another 3 people go in front of us. We go back. The nurse is just this side of rude, not to mention made some inappropriate comments. The dr, nurse prac whom ever she was basically looked me up and down said it sounds like it's all muscle and went to get me pain meds. I'm sorry WHAT??? No checking my eyes, reflexes, NOTHING!!! I was made to feel like I had walked in there simply to get meds. I didn't even bother to fill either scripts. You guys were totally worthless and I will NEVER waste my time there again!! You have no idea how much it took me to get to the drs and to be made to feel like complete shit was NOT what I needed.Dane Brooks 
Is a Con Man and Extremely Dishonest!!!,  BEWARE  I Had A HORRIBLE experience with him.This Man Has NO Business Being In The Business . Very Very SHADY Character.If you're looking for dirt cheap, you found it. With extra dirt, noise, ghetto crowds, and totally uncaring 1-star staff.  We had FREE ROOMS here and we still left! This place (in its current state) is not even worth free! 

We thought a brand new hotel would have brand new rooms, but the rooms are just the former Imperial Palace rooms which are still untouched, and still disgusting.  Even the signs on the doors are disgusting! As if the rooms weren't bad enough, the entire place is under construction, and its a nightmare getting in and out. They should just close while remodeling and then show everyone what a nice place it is in a year. 

Oh, and the "Luv Tub" rooms are super gross. We thought it would be a jacuzzi suite, but its not a jacuzzi or jetted tub, just a GIANT BATHTUB that literally can seat about 8 people. It also has a very stained and dirty mirror right over the bed. Maybe this would be a good place for a porn shoot or dirty orgy, but not somewhere you want to actually sleep or touch any surfaces of!

I absolutely would not set foot inside until after the entire remodel is finished. I am however, excited to see what it turns out to be in a year or so. The new complex they are building looks really cool.

I just wish they would do the public a favor and close completely during the remodel. But hey its Vegas, and they want to make their money. You've been warned. Spend $5 more and stay somewhere else. Totally not worth it even for free!Nooo. Was so excited to recieve our order and it was well below average.  The pizza has no flavor to it and the sandwiches are ok but ehh still. Lastly the beer battered combination was what I was looking forward to and yeah again no flavor and the batter came off very easily. Disappointed..Just a terrible experience. $15 for a single fries and a drink. The wait is too long because the employee has to serve at the adjoining pizza place. When I got my burger the meat was raw. Shame on Johny rickets for overpriced under cooked food!I would prefer to give this dump 0 stars. Bad food, horrible service, and on top of that they tried to rip us off. Paid $175 for seats to watch superbowl with open bar service. The waitress was non-existant and we had to wait 30 mins/pitcher of beer at the bar. When we got our bill at the end of the game it included a built in 20% gratuity....$150! Took another hour to find a manager to argue with to get it removed. I wouldn't recommend this place to my worst enemy.By far the worst food I have ever had!!!!The service was okay, but this place was a total rip-off, even with the Yelp "deal" we purchased.  Meals were greatly overpriced and you are required to buy two plates of meat to use the BBQ (despite the fact that we ordered additional items).  The quality of the meat was lacking, and the garnishes that I tried were far from delicious.  The "fried" tofu was soggy and tasteless.  I was excited for my first venture into Korean BBQ - but my search will have to continue.  This meal - and hit to my wallet - was one I'll be trying to forget.I saw Mumford and Sons here and it was the worst concert I've ever been to. They made you take off the caps of any water bottles you were taking in making it extremely inconvenient to stay hydrated on a hot summer night. You could not hear ANYTHING on the lawn. The faint sound of the band was either muffled by chants of "Turn it up!" or hushes from the crowd in attempt to get people quite enough to make out what song the band was singer. According to their facebook page people who attended different concerts experienced the same issues. Save yourself some money and buy a live album.So yeah this place opened up close by to me recently so I thought I'd hit it up and see what it was like since on the outside it seemed like a cool place to drink a beer and watch the dbacks and be left alone. Before doing so I skimmed the reviews and saw one that said "Now I know why it's called twin peaks" I knew what they meant by that, but took it with a grain of salt not expecting it to be the full blown love child of basically Cabella's, Hooter's and maybe a strip club and I found the place to be creepy and uncomfortable the whole time. Didn't really care much for how the waitresses would be constantly trying all these different angles to butter me up and play me to part with my hard earned cash like some insecure geek "aw shucks" loser/sucker. I think this place is mostly for the white collar type to safely experience a trailer trash fantasy they have. It totally gave the vibe and feel of a strip club when I used to go. No thanks.There is a reason this venue has only 3 stars.  The door guy, Brad Stiles, made it apparent to my girlfriend in table reservations that he was going to ignore her.  We had a reservation under his name from another host that is very prominent in Las Vegas.  He left us out for 2 hrs, then said sorry to my friend and said he will give us free drink tickets... Uh no thank you. You have away our table!!! We don't want free drinks I want my $1500 table!! He was a D*ck.Came here for Cinco de Mayo. Margaritas were delicious. However the service was not  great. We went in around 5pm. The lights were so dim, we couldn't see the menu (which WE had to ask the server for) I asked 3 times for the lights to be turned up. They did and ten minutes after someone else started messing with the lights. It was pretty annoying. The server took longer than expect to take our order.  Once she did, she didn't write it down. (This always makes me nervousness because I feel they're going to forget something ) of course it happened. My order came out. But we were still waiting on my moms food. I asked the server about the food and she forgot to put the order in. She did apologize and I understand things happen. By the time my mom's food came , my fajitas were cold. I didn't say anything. By this time I just wanted to eat and leave. The server asked us from behind the bar if we were doing ok. To me that wasn't personable at all. Once we were done eating, I went to the ladies room and it was disgusting. Seems that nobody checked the bathroom for a while. It was very messy. My experience was not great and we won't be coming back to Hacienda.Um.....
Ended up here on a Saturday night.
The club was super dead... yet they had a line out the door.
So, there I was, standing in the middle of the place... and the only other people who passed the door test were 50+ and NOT attractive.  
WTF?!!?
Stayed for a $15 drink and then bolted.

I can understand line building to a certain extent, but this was off the charts oldpeopleville.

Won't be back.There are a lot of extra fees for everything, show tickets had extra fees, spirit airlines was over the top. Carry on baggage fees. Thy did disclose the daily hotel tax.  Las Vegas is fun place to go, but it's time to check out alternatives.Went to this place after our normal sushi place had a really long wait (naka sushi just down the street). We should have just waited there. This place is horrible. The sushi menu is small compared to other sushi places. No idea where people are getting extensive menu from. Ordered the orange tiger roll and nearly three up in my mouth. The service is terrible. I had to ask multiple times for a side of eel sauce. Waiter brought us someone else's food and we tried declining it but he said that we did order it and have to eat it if we ordered it. WTF? Nigiri tastes awful here and the fish does not seem very fresh. Stay the hell away from this place.This has to be the absolute worst Greek / Mediterranean food in all of Las Vegas. I was so excited to try it and find a new place close to my house and boy, was I wrong. I got the chicken salad... the chicken was slimey and repulsive. The salad was generic iceberg lettuce and was not a Greek salad in any shape or form. My boyfriend had the kafta... another dish we couldnt eat. There was chunks of fat hanging from the meat. Never again.We came for happy hour and stayed for the fruit flies...
Monday night is a good deal half off drinks and appetizers. We were sat and the waited for 15 min before anyone came to take our DRINK order. So once our waitress came by our table to get us drinks it took another 15 min before a Magner's and a 7 & 7 made their way back to our table. The 7&7 had a hitchhiker floating around in the glass. So we got that drink replaced one we saw the waitress again. The replacement drink came back pretty quick. So we ordered Chicken Nachos and the Quesadilla. The Nachos are HUGE. and that might not be a good thing. The chicken that was just on the top layer was ICE cold. I mean barely above freezing. Service just went down from there. The Waitress must have known a group sitting at another table because she screamed ran over there and spent the next 10 minutes doing shots and drinking with them. Needless to say. Service was horrible. Absolutely abysmal. There is no way to sugar coat that. In an "Irish" pub you should never be thirsty.Will not eat at this overrated place. Even the manager has no good customer service. Yes the place was busy but that doesn't excuse that other tables that sat after us got their food first and on top of that they were missing two of our entrees. The waiter didn't even look like he was checking up on our order it was the other waiter who was trying to help.
As for the food it's just a plain fried chicken anybody can cook it. The sisig was a pile of greasy pork pieces. It's so bad that I rather eat at jollibees.Day and time of incident: Sunday, April 6, 2014 - 10:40am.

I'll make it brief.. ordered food, 20 minutes later, still no food. Hungry, want to get on the road asap. Decided instead of arguing for food to get refund and head across the street to In N Out. (Should of been first choice, shot my own foot!) *sigh*

Not exactly sure who is at fault here, whether management or employee.

  Apparently this female employee did not have the competence to add up my order and refund my money.. maybe if she was a teenager, that would of been excusable.
  As she was pushing buttons on the monitor and looking back and forth at my receipt, she started twitching and looked liked the monitor was a ticking time bomb from how fast she was going trying to disable it from blowing her into smithereens. After a few unfortunate attempts and still unable to add up the order to the equivalent price for refund, she jumped, panicked, starting speaking gibberish and then turned around and left to the back of the kitchen.

Extremely disrespectful leaving us there and would say unprofessional of her but then again, not sure if her (just assuming) G.E.D or high school diploma even covered that term. Which then points to management and the kind of training they provide to their employees.
Poor lady, sure do feel sorry for her. Supervisor gave me my refund, ate a delicious burger from In N Out, drove back to California.

Customer Service = ZERO stars.

Words of Wisdom:Stay In School Kids and Get Good Grades.If I could give a negative star I would but I figure 1 is more if an insult how, if the meat is warm? Can you serve a cold burrito I have given this place 2 chances and I advise everyone please please don't stop at the 16 at location keep going to 7 st or 7 ave locations so very disappointed ted I. This location give the name a bad reputation!Came on a Thursday night and it's not open when Yelp said it was.  Probably no longer in business....  It is now 10:12 pm.I feel like this place just raped my day. The waitress obviously doesn't know how to do her job due to the lack of customer service and understanding that she actually have to check up on the tables she is serving. When we asked to speak to the manger she seemed more perplex by the English language than comprehending our compliant. Food was crappy and falling apart. The only good thing about this restaurant is the UofA flag hanging outside, do not come here.Stay away!!!!!!!!!!!!! The owner is the worst and the customer service is awful!!!! I had a confirmed delivery package sent to this store, my customer never received her package. When I called he said "if there is no signature it is not my problem,  you should have a signature for packages that have high value" crazy thing is I never told him what the package was or the value so how does he know?? Not only that he said since I don't pay him he doesn't need to provide service to me and hung up in my face! The rudest place ever! It's weird how usps has proof the package was sent now he is acting as if he never received it!! I can't believe it. He is all about money!!!!!!!!!!!!! Stay away!!!!Absolute con artists. My mother took her car here for their "oil change special" and wouldn't you know, they were able to find $1500 worth of auto work that needed to be done. My mom, not being very savvy with cars agreed to have partial work done since she didn't have $1500 lying around. These scumbags charged my mom for brake pads and new rotars and didn't even perform the work. When I inspected her car, they still had the original pads/rotars. When I called the manager, I got nothing but denial and excuses. 

Please....Please......Please DO NOT take your car here for anything!!!!   These guys are complete shysters. You're better off going to Tire Pros on Power Rd or a dealership.I had to remove my other review because first impressions can be wrong.

AWEFUL!! Went with my parents and the rude young girl taking the order messed every burger up! Went up to complain and nobody would listen they kept their heads down and never made eye contact with me.
So I came home and wrote a letter. I gave them a week to get back to me and still no reply. Don't go if you want your order screwed up and you actually want to enjoy your dinner....
We won't be going back to the Habit, ever again.I ordered delivery because of the good reviews. I ordered garlic knots and a hawaiian pizza. When the food arrived, the garlic knots were stale and crunchy. I could not eat them. The pizza wasn't much better. The cheese was already rubberized andbthe grease soaked through to the bottom leaving a floppy, soggy crust. I wouldn't recommend eating this to anyone. It was one of those times that trying something new over the usual was a disaster.When you arrive this spa LOOKS beautiful and I was excited to have my Pedi and gel manicure. I was assigned to Jenny and had the worst pedicure ever!!!! When I questioned her on why she BARELY scrubbed the bottom on my feet  ( literally one swipe across on each foot) she said my feet were fine. She did an ok job on my gel manicue. Jenny was rude and when we were done never said thank you  or waited for me to thank her, just went to her next client.
I am used to any spa offering you something to drink like water but no offer of anything. I would never go back and will be looking tomorrow for another spa to redo my pedicure.Don't go to this restaurant especially if you are a local. They overcharged us once and put it on our credit card. And then when we pointed out the mistake they charge us the correct amount,but did not take the incorrect charge off the card. I'm now working with my credit card company to take the incorrect charge off.Beware of Tapas at Pita Jungle:   While I like Pita Jungle's food, beware everyone of what Pita Jungle labels and markets as "Tapas".  While Tapas means small plates in Spain and the world over (and I have experienced it in Spain, London, LA and many other cities), Pita Jungle seems to be using the label Tapas to ripoff customers with "teaspoon servings".  I got 2 meager shrimp for $1.50 each and two paltry mussels for the same amount.  They must be laughing all the way to the bank, while I went home hungry.  What's more, when I earnestly brought this up to the manager, he patronized me asking me if I knew what Tapas was.  Clearly it is he, who does not know what Tapas means, or he wouldn't take that attitude with customers.  If you are going to market your company on serving Mediterranean  food like Pita Jungle does, at least do your research and market, serve & employ staff who know what it really means and serve small plates...not teaspoon servings.  It's just more honest.It was a late night and we decided to get one more beer and a bit of food. I asked for a recommendation of the best burger, like I do at a lot of places. I was told "it's really good". I said, I asked for a recommendation and Greg said the same thing. The bartender clarified that the name of the burger was called, it's really good. It was like who's on first bit so I played along. Greg then said "maybe the 5th time is the charm". I could tell you about the unwillingness to offer up alcohol info, making fun of another 2 guys who were at the bar, the asking us if we want pepper when we were done already, or the sheer overall uncaring shown to the 6 people to our left and right - but it's late and I need sleep. We got a comment card at the end and I wanted to fill it out, but we weren't given an ink pen - I said, do you want my birthday so I can join your rewards? I was told it's a comment card and they have no idea what the birthday is used for. We then offered up feedback to Greg and the bartender personally. The bartender seemed to care, and he did a pretty decent job. Greg knew we were upset with him and the girls next to us were to. He sat and took it but never apologized or wanted to make it right. We left paying the full bill. This placed opened in December and both of them have been there since the beginning. This place was horrible - I will never come back. And I hope nobody else goes unless something changes in a HUGE way. The names attached to this place made me want to go - food was so average and beer prices were marked up 900% on bottles. Avoid at all costs.Truly one of the worst buffets I have ever eaten at. Went in with an open mind and I have no problem giving 4 or 5 stars when it is warranted, even for a buffet, but this place barely qualifies for 1 pitiful star. I would give it ZERO stars if it was an option. As someone who loves asian food, this buffet made me feel so sad for the total lack of flavor and passion by those who prepared the food at this sorry excuse for a chinese buffet. Case in point, raw jalapeno pepper in a sushi roll and breaded chicken that was so black it looked like a piece of coal. WTF? Would not be suprised when Lin Buffet is on Dirty Dining. Do not go here! AWFUL AWFUL!!This place is horrible. My group was on a time crunch so we scheduled appointments where we could all get manis and pedis at the same time.  They told us this was possible on the phone but when we got there they had taken two girls before us and there was only two techs. After 15 minutes they started having us soak while they continued working on the other girls. The two of us set to soak in the pedi seats looked down and saw dead skin in the tub. We quickly left and went down the street to Biagio. So much better!Won't be coming back.  Sat at a table for 30 minutes with a group and was never asked for my order to be taken.  Then walked up to a waiter where he enters orders and asked if I could order before happy hour ended. He said it was too late.  I told him I had been waiting for a long time and he didn't care.  I went back to my table and my cell phone said 6:59 so there was still 1 minute left.  Someone else at my table ordered onion rings 40 minutes prior and never got them.  A customer at the bar was saying how she ordered pizza on a previous day and it came without sauce.  Not sure why she came back.  We left without ordering and won't be back.  They're setting themselves up for an episode of Bar Rescue but at 3 weeks into the business I doubt Jon Taffer would even touch this place.I understand that with a first year event there are always kinks to work out.  I certainly don't expect everything to run smoothly.  But REALLY!?!?!  This event was a disaster from start to finish.  

The parking was ridiculous.  Attendees were directed to a dirt lot but if you were approaching from the west (as we were), getting into the lot was via green yield.  Which meant that things backed up.  At some point, we turned around and approached from the other direction which was slightly better.  While waiting in the hellish line, one person went on ahead (on foot) to grab the will-call tickets.  

Eventually, we gave up and parked on 1st street.  Wish we'd done this from the beginning as there was tons of space and it was just a short walk.  

In general, I avoid will-call because it's just one more line to stand in.  But, this event gave us no other option.  The will call lines were crazy long and I was thankful that we had the foresight to send someone ahead.  

Upon getting our bracelets, we learned that there is a limit on alcohol samples - we had eight tickets with our bracelets.  This was never disclosed pre-event.  Unlimited should mean unlimited.  

The lines for samples were ridiculously long.  To add insult to injury, some of the samples were just downright sad.  And waiting in a very long line for two swallows of wine is just not my idea of a good time.  

We happened to note that one restaurant (I forget which one) literally brought a small Weber grill.  Did the organizers not give the restaurants a heads-up on expected attendance or were these guys strangely optimistic? We'll never know.  

When all was said and done, the part that bothered us most of all was that we really didn't feel like we got the value out of our tickets.  If we'd each gone to a restaurant and spent $60, we would have had a really nice meal, a cocktail or two and not been cooking for two hours in the Arizona sun.

The event itself was only three hours long and if you "wasted" any event time on signing up for one of many giveaways, watching the band or the cooking demonstrations, or going to the bathroom, that's time you're not standing in line for the next morsel of food.  

The Taste in Tempe is literally just that...  a taste.Waiting,  waiting,  waiting. Don't they have staff.
Staff standing around doing nothing. This sux.Service is pretty horrendous if I might say so myself.  The only thing giving this a 1 star is the decor and the manager that I will talk about later in my review.


Definitely Not a fan of the girl working on 5/24 at 11 being a bit to touchy feely with my boyfriend sitting next to me and calling him baby and sweetheart all night(in which he knew and plenty of other people I told about her actions knew why I would be livid). That is the reason for the 1 star mostly along with the burnt slider she probably told the chefs to burn on purpose. The fact I have to get up and help myself to my own water since she failed to ask me at one point after I finished my first glass of water if I needed anything else or different. The manager (I think) helped me more than she did and directed me to where I needed to go; since she is obviously a horrid customer service employee not noticing that if I empty out of glass and not ask if I needed anything further is a tad annoying. Asking once if I need anything isn't enough if you are a server/waiter/bartender.  But apparently in her eyes it's okay to just care about the a girls boyfriend and pissing off girlfriends at this bar.

The sliders were not really pleasant  and i had been drinking too so you think they would be more than tolerable but good god they were so charred. Nothing I would reorder unless they didn't burn the burger so much. The bacon made the whole sliders were the only thing keeping me from not touching it completely.

Will I be back? Maybe if they got rid of the bartender touchy feely lady that got me all riled up.  If she is there next time i can promise you that management will be notified at that point if she starts being her inappropriate self. I'm severely tempted to write a letter of complaint to the company if they don't read these since I have never felt so disgusted in my whole entire life going to a restaurant/bar.  Being Disrespected in the slightest is what i have no tolerance for what so ever and she crossed every possible line and worse by not even asking me at one point if  I would like one thing after I finished my first glass of water.  

When i was going to pay for our tab and my boyfriend hurried so he could sneak in her undeserved tip and our balance she had no idea that we were even on the same tab since I apparently wasn't allowed to order anything for myself.

I literally felt like this was some kind of joke like I should have been on one of those shows like Restaurant stakeout.

*threatened by kindness and spunk to my boyfriend alone. Not to me. When you come to a restaurant you would hope for consistent service not once at the beginning. That's like getting seated at a restaurant and not getting any service afterwards. I love how people want to say that I am wrong and not making a factual speculation. Good god people.Not good at all!! The meat was flavorless and the salsa was water down.  I didn't care for my meal and it upset my stomach. I will not go back to this place. Poor quality in food!Don't waste your time going to see this show. Boring production. I went to see this show after hearing a dear friend of mine had NEVER been paid for his time performing in this 'snooze fest'...Danny Z of Danny Z Productions nothing less than a double-talking con man, and most likely couldn't produce a turd, let alone a show-unless you care to consider this show HIS turd...save your money, don't waste your time...
