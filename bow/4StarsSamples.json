Gr8 place! Service decent. Food portions are plentiful! My daughter had a couple of pancakes that  were the size of a hubcap!
She said they were very tasty!  I had the country scramble. Loved it. Prices were good. Nice local joint. Recommend!!I went on a tour of several breweries last summer and Capital Brewery was one of my favorites. The tour guide was EXTREMELY annoying (very, very peppy) but the tour was still pretty interesting. The best part was the end. The brewery makes several excellent beers (they were rated as the #1 brewery in the US by someone, sometime). I had never been there before but we stuck around after the tasting and ended up right in the middle of an enormous party! Apparently all of Middleton comes out on Friday night after work to relax and have a good time. They don't serve food but several people brought in picnic baskets and I saw a few grills around. Fun place to hang out with friends, I'll be back sometime.I prefer when I can to shop from a local business.  I have not had luck with their Oregon location but when I am near I do shop this location.  Normally I look for Scott and he hooks me up with what I need.Ok so lets be honest. The hotel is not fancy. It's a pretty normal building. I didn't find it dirty or ran down. Which is great. We only needed a one room stay for me and my husband to attend a wedding. We got a king size on the 6th floor. Room was clean, bathroom was clean, lobby was clean. And everything worked, AC, toilet, shower, sink, so I have nothing to complain about. If you are looking for someone quick and not a honeymoon stay lol this is it! Prices are very reasonable too. $80 compared to $125 for Marriott. no thanks! I'd rather buy shoes with the $50 extra dollars and they have a light free breakfast, is not fancy but you can catch a bagel and orange juice so u Dont leave with an empty stomach!I have lunch here all the time. The veggie wrap, Greek breakfast burrito and the caprese sandwich are terrific. They serve great local coffee and desserts too. The meeting room in the back can be reserved for small groups (say 10-15). Friendly staff and locally owned.Amazing is all I can say. They have absolutely everything. No, it's not organic but it's super homemade and killer. I get something different every time I am there and have yet to be disappointed. All the brats, beef, chicken, BACON are all wonderful. Support local butchers or they will disappear! Perfect example, I went in and asked for a pound of italian sausage (kale/cauliflower/sausage pot pie, yum!) and they were out but they offered to make me some on the spot. Really amazing service and great product quality. Make the trip to Jim'sNote - grounds only, didn't get to the conservatory.

Of the various Civic Tourism opportunities around Madison, Olbrich takes the prize for best in show. Fantastic assortment of native flora, meticulously planned to keep something interesting to see year-round (except during the Wisconsin winter, I guess).  Beautiful arrangements, with adjoining themed areas: roses, herbs, even poisons! It also features, perhaps oddly,  the only Thai Sala in the continental US -- I think I first saw one in Hawaii -- and its fragile gold leaf has survived multiple midwestern winters surprisingly well. 

It's all free, and while you can self-guide I cannot recommend the tours highly enough.  We chanced to arrive just before the last of the day, and our guide, Paul, was everything you want in a volunteer guide: highly knowledgeable and enthusiastic about all aspects of the garden and its history, our tour was ninety minutes that felt like twenty.Mmmmmmmmmm.  The buffet is awesome.  Delicious food and enough variety.  You must visit this lunchtime buffet.  Not much of a location, but cannot go wrong with the food.  Awesome value.Huh, so we're reviewing libraries now? OK, I'm game.

First, this is the Pinney branch - it doesn't say that in the header.

What can I say? Public libraries are awesome and this one is no exception. There are thousands of books, plus magazines, video, audio and even tools (did you know you can check out tools?) all for free. There are plenty of places to sit, tables if you're trying to get work done, and computers for public use. There's also a big meeting room where they hold a nice variety of interesting events. There are several themed book displays around the library, which is nice when I wander in just looking for something, anything, to read. I think my favorite feature, though, is the hold service: you can request any item from any library in roughly half of the state, and it will be delivered to this library in short order. I know, it's a common library service these days, but have you ever stopped to think about how amazingly helpful it really is? And for free!

My only disappointment is that the circulation desk staff are pretty consistently unfriendly. Rarely rude, never incompetent, just very few smiles and no unnecessary words. I hope they like their jobs more than they seem to!

Things I have seen at this library:
- Art work from my kid's school and several other area schools
- Kids knitting
- Bats & snakes
- Kids reading to dogsReally great chips and salsa!!! Also, one of the best Margaritas in town! The food is good, patio has a great atmosphere. reasonable prices for what it is.Yay for small theaters!!!! Seriously. All you people that love those huge grandiose things need to experience the intimacy and power that comes with a small theater, and a nice one on top of that. 

The Herberger is in a great location and is a great venue to see a show. The staff is always really friendly and the space is always clean. It has class without being too stale and old. Like downtown hipster class. It's nice. Soothing. Fun. Good for all ages. 

The bar inside also has a window for the outside patio which is great for nice evenings and intermissions :) Also, if you're lucky you will see some musical troubadours outside as well.

One awesome thing is that you can get parking validated for the Arizona Center for $3. You park there, take your ticket, then go to the Herberger box office and get a validation ticket. When you exit the Arizona Center, enter the ticket you got when you parked and then the validation one.

So now you have no more excuses not to go (if the light rail didn't help already).

See you there!!We visited Majerle's to kill some traffic time leaving downtown. I came with no expectations and only wanted a drink and some downtime to cap off the evening. Well, this was accomplished! And well might I add. 

We sat at the bar, were greeted prompty and served politely. Both bartenders were personable and efficient. The crowd around seemed upbeat, business casual and relaxed. Decent, though not overly crowded scene for a Saturday night. 

The menu looked diverse and varied drinks available. Decor was clean, modern, and comforting. Prices were on par for the area and venue. 

Really not a ton I can comment on as it was one drink (It really was, too!). No, not "two", TOO! 

Seems like a nice place to relax when downtown. Would I drive here just for Majerle's? Nope. Would I pop in if downtown wanting a drink or some food? For sure.authentic mexican sit down food..10x better than a garcias or a macayos. be carefull of going on a sat or sunday morning...20 to 30 minute wait for sure.This place offers pretty good food at really low prices. i think it's a mother daughter team that own it and they are the sweetest ladies ever. It's probably not a good idea to order a hot yakisoba bowl  on a hot day and eat it on the patio. I try to always eat with chopsticks and i just kept getting hot  sauce on my face.  Oh only complaint is their tofu. It's just diced and sauteed. i would like it if maybe they marinated, baked and then sauteed. Panko fish is delicious!Everything I've ever had here is excellent (I've probably eaten here about 10 times).  The "Gr√ºben" is my favorite (grilled turkey, swiss, slaw, spicy mustard, rye bread), but chicken roll-ups are a close second.  They offer a great selection of sides, and the fruit is always fresh. The limeade is so worth it in my opinion, though I don't think you get refills on that.  (Note if you buy a big cup you can bring it back for a deal on the limeade.)  Also note that if you check in on your Yelp phone app, Zoe's gives 10% off; every 3 check-ins gets you a free piece of chocolate cake. I'm a fan of the cake as are many others, though my wife didn't care for it.  Oh, and the parking: very tough to get right now with the construction next door. If you wait a few minutes you should get a space in the lot and won't have to park around the corner. (I haven't tried parking in the costume store lot.)Well... today we showed up to meet some people for a yelp thing. It was supposed to be a wine tasting at 4:30. I made reservations for today at 4:30 and was not corrected either time I called, but then maybe they were busy and figured I knew the right time.
I showed up with the Hubster and Weinski for some vino-education, only to find out that the wine tasting actually began at 3:30, not 4:30. Well, the manager, Dave, sat us at the bar and told Jeff, the bar man, to take care of us. He let us sample some wines before choosing our glasses, and they also were kind enough to throw in the cheese plate that the wine tasters were enjoying. Unfortunately they had run out of the fontina during the official tasting, so we ended up with a more expensive and very tasty cheese.
I enjoyed the Titus Zinfandel, Hubster ordered a dessert white, and Weinski got a Chardonnay before sampling the 3 Olives well vodka. He might have a headache later on.
The ambiance was nice. A simple place in a great location, Cheuvront serves up a nice vino. We enjoyed our seats at the bar, the decor, and good conversation with Dave and Jeff. I caught a glimpse of the dessert tray. While one too many episodes of Ramsey's Kitchen Nightmares left me disappointed in pumpkin bread pudding that had been baked two days or so ago, it all looked delicious. I'll be back on an empty stomach to try the pear and candied walnut salad, chicken or veggie lasagna, and the dessert of the day.
I'll also do my best to try something other than my new favorite, the Titus Zin. Full bodies red with hints of raspberries and blackberries. Light on the tannins, just like I like.
If I frequent this place, I might get even better at pretending to be a wine snob! I might even actually learn something!I love this arena...maybe I am biased since I am a diehard Suns fan and a downtown resident, but it really is a nice facility.  The Suns games are always well put together...great announcer, great dancers, great entertainment, and great concessions.

I attended the last game of the season in a suite Wednesday night and was impressed with the space and the food...actually quite good!useful tip...buy the cheapest ticket for a game and then come here for $35 and eat until you are satisfied...well worth it...and to think i was paying $30 for the All You Can Eat section with only Hot dogs, Chips, Peanuts, Popcorn, Soda & Water....i will be back to the ABC next season for sureCool place, great for a weekday lunch (as long as you don't mind smelling like Mexican food for the rest of the day).

The taco is the best I've had in Arizona, and the super-nachos are so big, it's kind of embarrassing to walk through the restaurant with them.

Also - the bakery is excellent! You can visit twice a week for a year and try something new each time. The stuffed churros are particularly delicious.Art Gallery house in a space that is, well, a house. There is a huge backyard that is excellent for art openings because they can set up a stage for entertainment, a small bar area, a small appetizer area (veggies with dip and some desserts), and still have room for chairs and tables, seating around a fire pit, and there is a koi pond as well. 
I have found that the art varies, even by artist. I've now come to two different exhibits and I enjoyed both very much. There is a good turnout at events and exhibits will run for several weeks following an opening. 
The vibe is friendly, eccentric, and casual. Street parking in the neighborhood.Thank you yet again Yelp, for hooking me up with this excellent restaurant. Coronado Cafe is absolutely the definition of quaint. Built inside a humble, antiquated house, and populated with both an excellent selection of wine and beers, Coronado Cafe makes for a great spot for a surprise weekend date. 

Making it there just 30 minutes before close, I was a bit worried we'd miss out on the freshest food, or the best recommendations. I was wrong on both accounts. When our very friendly waiter came around, he offered the crusted rock fish as a special. Although many other items looked tantalizing on the menu, both the lady and I jumped on the opportunity. 

The fish came out perfect, with just the right amount of crunch, and being cooked well enough to have no questions it was done without drying it out. The rice and mashed potatoes served with it complimented it perfectly. 

All in all it was a wonderful experience. I am glad that Yelp has made this place accessible to people who don't live in the area!Lots of superior flavors in all of the dishes that I have had. Doesnt matter if you order a pork dish, tacos, soup, whatever, it is all fun to eat. Just a delight.Great sandwiches and a real soda fountain.  Try a cherry lime phosphate.  Trust me.Their sandwiches are excellent! I like to get the slider trio with bbq chicken, brisket, and pulled pork. Their potato salad is pretty decent but not as good as grandma's ;). Also, their coleslaw is quite nice but just a touch of too much mayo. Now comes the bad part: the ribs. I absolutely love bbq ribs and unfortunately their's were dry with very little meat on the bone. I would not recommend the ribs here to anyone. Stick with the sammy's and you'll be all good.Back for Football season due to person I was meeting lived near here. They had large pitchers of Bud Light for $6.25 and some other specials, but no food deals. Did enjoy the cheese crisp with fresh roasted green chili's for $5 and after many pitchers had a burger there. Fresh Ground beef, cooked well done (my order was the only one going) with cheese and bacon to soak up the booze. Very friendly staff throughout the PM and night games. Might not be great for watching every game, but times when there are only one or two games, it is a perfect alternative to bigger, flashier bars.Last night I made a totally bad ass salad here at the salad bar. It had great things in it like chick peas and hot peppers and nuts. It totally rocked and made my night.

Other good things about AJ's:

The beer case. I'm a beer drinking chick and I always find something new and interesting to try.

The cheese case. Despite my lactose intolerance I LURVE cheeses of all kinds. AJ's does not disappoint.

If you need to pick up flowers it is very easy and convenient to create your own arrangement here. This is good to know for special occasions, parties...etc. (HINT HINT: Buy me flowers!!!) I also like to buy a fresh single stem or two and whip up a simple yet funky piece for the nightstand or dinner table. It just looks so fresh and chic and smells nice.I now know where the hipsters are in Phoenix. 
An easy ordering menu like In-N-Out, but with fresh rustic sandwiches.  
Only four different sandwiches, four different salads, and a small variety of sodas in a bottle makes life easy to decide.    
I liked the quick service, the banter between the staff and regulars, and bench seating.  
I don't like that it's only open for lunch on the weekdays.
Whatever they are doing though, they are doing it right, because I think about eating there a lot and their other restaurant Pizzeria Bianco.Yes, it's a really nice cozy bar to hang out and have drinks and even enjoy the entertainment. But this is also a good place to come for a delicious light lunch or brunch at friendly prices.  The good food and drinks, the very casual vibe and friendly staff makes every visit here a pleasure.Pizza Heaven is the perfect lunch spot. It is such a good deal and very tasty pizza. For around $5 you get a slice of pizza, salad, and drink - and for a small up charge you can get any toppings you want on your single slice. Most places in the area charge way more for pizza of this quality and you can't order just a single slice the way you like it. I'm a fan!Cheap good haircuts who could complain!We got take out from here during a spring break trip. Noodles, sushi, edamame, popcorn shrimp. All delicious. I ate the leftover noodles, cold, for breakfast, the next morning.Definitely my go to nail place when I am in Phoenix.  Lee is excellent with my nails - fast, friendly and efficient and the pedicures are great too!Best Happy Hour in Town. Sunday, Monday, Tuesday half price bottles of wine, drink specials and from 3PM to 6PM, $5 menu items.

The Rokerij is one of my favorite little spots. Great, cozy downstairs bar with fireplace, good music and great staff. It can get a little crowded but worth it.  Great spot for a date!

The small plates are my favorite.  The bacon wrapped scallops, brie toast and chile relleno.  The plates are very rich, however.

I think they have an amazing wine list and I've never had a dissapointing wine.  They spend time on their wine and having wine sales experience, their buyer knows their wines.

It can get busy for happy hour, but well worth the wait my friends.The smoothie could have been mixed a little bit better, unless you like sucking banana pieces up your straw. 

Teenage girls behind the counter were perky. Although I was the only patron in the store at the time, they asked my name when I placed my order. Odd, I thought, but cool. 

Very clean place with limited seating. Music was loud, though. Guess the teens were jammin' with Jamba.I am embarrassed to admit that tonight was my first time here, even though I've lived within walking distance for 5 years, because I assumed it would not be good. WRONG. Why is this place not more of a yelp gem?

(Actually, one reason I've never pursued it is because I think at one point the reviews were mixed up between this place the the place on McDowell. This review is for the restaurant on the NW corner of 24th St and Indian School.)

It was totally empty at 6pm on Saturday when I stopped in to get takeout. The woman helping me was very polite and helped me pick out a few things from the Chinese menu. 

The Singapore noodles were scrumptious and I ate the whole order by myself. 
The green beans with XO sauce were also tasty, although plan to use those more as a side than an entree (and as a heads up, I do not think they are vegetarian, though one might assume them to be; I think there is some diced dried fish in the sauce making it YUMMY but not veggie).

The soup of the day was described as "rehydrated bok Choi soup". I'm not sure what that means, exactly, since when is bok choi DEhydrated anyway? I don't think she thought I'd like it because it was more of a traditional Chinese soup, but I loved it. It was very brothy with ultra-boiled greens, some unfamiliar mushroom or possibly dried plum thing, and (I think) boiled peanuts. The broth had a slightly sweet quality to it, similar to Pho broth. I'm not making the soup sound that good, but it was. Just try it. 

I had heard that the winter melon soup is great, but the woman told me that while occasionally they have it as a daily soup, usually you have to call a couple of days in advance to order it so they can prepare.

I'm so glad I finally found a good neighborhood Chinese restaurant.You can't go wrong with Embassy Suites. Even in Arizona, I found the same comfort as I did at other Embassy Suites in the Bay Area. Living area, bar area, dining area. Comfortable beds and fluffy pillows. They do a good job making people feel at home.

But I must rave about their complimentary breakfast. As an early riser, I was able to take full advantage of their breakfast stations. I don't usually eat breakfast, but I couldn't say no to made-to-order omelets, hashbrowns, bacon and french toast. =DI finally visited Postino's after being in AZ for a year...and I'm glad I finally did!  Great drinks and great food!  The bruschettas are to die for...but stay alive so you can come here again and again!

Staff is friendly and vibe is really chill...you can come after work with a few friends or bring a larger group to celebrate. 

The ambiance is superb...the indoor/outdoor seating gives great options depending on the heat!  :-)

Run, don't walk to Postinos (depending on how hot it is!)We are new to the area and a lot of people kept telling us to check out Postino.  We finally were able to on a Thursday around 7:30.  The place was cool, I liked the vibe, BUT do not go here if loud music bothers you because they are definitely cranking it.  The fig/prosciutto bruschetta and the tomato jam with sheeps cheese were our favorite!"Its like im on vacation! "said Nathan as we were waiting to get our food. "It is... I could use the sounds of the ocean though" then Nathan replies with, "im just replacing the traffic sounds with ocean sounds" Good stuff man! 

Nice outdoor seating and lighting, also the heatlamp was effing awesome! it really does have the remote feel, I felt like I was far far away... instead I was only a block from my place. 

The food... holy good god... this shit is awesome. I got some chicken dish with a great orangish, spicy-ish sauce which was unreal. I cant wait to try a few other items on the menu. 

The service was nothing to write home about, but who gives a shit with this type of food and atmosphere.I love this place. They have the cheapest and best breakfast food I've ever had. They make the best bacon in all the land!!The pizza is really good. Just make sure you're on your A game - like other people have said, there are so. many. rules. I've never caught attitude from an employee, but they've got me terrified.Lately I find my tastes changing. These changes ambush me without warning: not long ago I stopped putting Splenda in my tea - cold turkey. I started liking pastrami instead of corned beef. I stopped watching the news on TV. Is this a function of aging? I don't know.

One of the more dramatic changes has been my growing appreciation of the overall "character" of a restaurant. I find myself much more willing to overlook small gaffes in the food preparation if the staff is friendly and knowledgeable, or if the ambience is cheerful and interesting in some way. It doesn't have to be fancy - but it can't be gloomy and boring.

This was brought home to me today at lunch. Our friend Sue picked a place I had never been to - Spinato's Pizza. It's a family owned and run local chain with four locations. We went to the one at Bell and 16th Street. Sue brought along her friend/employer Lee. It happens that Lee's grandson works in Spinato's kitchen. He always makes it a point to arrive 35 minutes before his shift begins so he can take advantage of employee dinner and he appreciates being treated like family. The place is cute - decorated in red, green and white. There are striped awnings above the booths, and trellises with vines. The chairs are white with green (or red) seats, and the table tops are white with the Spinato logo in the corners. The patio has tables with red-checked cloths. We were warmly greeted , and our server arrived promptly to offer drinks.

Ken and I ordered a large Spicy Italian pie ($19.50) with added ricotta. We also got a salad ($3.99). Lee requested garlic bread ($3.99, $4.79 with cheese), and a small spinach calzone, one of the house specialties ($9). Sue got spinach too, but in the form of a "lil" (smaller than small) pizza ($7.50). The salads arrived first, notable mostly for their large size. While the ingredients were fresh, there was nothing exciting there. The olive oil and balsamic vinegar served with them were of good quality. The garlic bread, eight pieces in the order, was outstanding - lots and lots of fresh garlic and a generous amount of butter. You have to make sure that everyone you'll be talking to in the next few hours has eaten some too. The staff checked in frequently to ask if we were happy. The pizzas were served on a wire rack, a great idea since the thin crust remains nice and crisp. Instead of slices, our pie was cut into many small squares. I found that for some reason this caused me to eat less. The pizza wasn't loaded down with sauce, and it had plenty of toppings. I tasted Sue's spinach pie and it was really good. The spinach is marinated before being put on the pizza, and there's tons of fresh garlic. Lee's calzone was quite large - he took half of it home.

The menu isn't extensive. Besides the pizzas (10 varieties, plus design your own)  and calzone (there's a spaghetti and meatball one) there are two pastas and five sandwiches. We didn't inquire about dessert. The story behind Spinato's is told on the back of the menu. The family was worried that when they left Chicago for Phoenix, back in the "70's, they wouldn't be able to find good pizza. What choice did they have but to open their own pizza parlor?! As the family grew so did the number of parlors. While the prices aren't low, you can go to lunchclub.com and get a 25% off the entire bill coupon. Aren't coupons great!!

I have to say that if I was doing a blind taste-test between Stumpy's pizza (see the archives) and Spinato's, I'd probably give the nod to Stumpy's. But if you add in those other factors which have become important to me, as a dining destination Spinato's wins. It's also won awards from Phoenix New Times, the Scottsdale Culinary Festival and City Search.Been going there for 15 years.  Great pizza!!  Real NY style pizza at a fair price.Nice, cozy Italian restaurant with a Chicago-style Jazz band. We have been here before and remember food was good. The truth is, the appetizers are the best, especially the mussels! I never had better marinara sauce with succulent mussels. I was not too crazy about my order of mahi-mahi but the cream br√ªl√©e was excellent. I love the music, ambiance and wine. I will go back.This restaurant was highly recommended to us - so much so that if we did not like our meal he would reimburse us.  No need to...  We had a large pizza - pretty good toppings - I don't think the mushrooms were fresh though and the sauce was a little too sweet for my taste.  The service was very friendly and we also had a dessert - Apple Spendata (sp) very good.

We definitely go back and try something different.  We visited for lunch on 12/31/11 - not too busy  - yet.......My son and I had the chicken fried rice and it was excellent. Very good flavor and lots of chicken. Also ordered the crab puffs which weren't bad, but I wasn't as impressed with them. (Am I the only one who remembers when crab puffs actually had crab in them?) We ate in and had the place to ourselves on a Friday night. Clean inside, tables looked brand new or like they are hardly used. Food arrived to our table hot, and plates and utensils were spotless. Service was ok, not rude but not very friendly either. I'm thinking this is a nice place to go to when you want a more quiet setting than the usual Friday night crowded restaurant. Several people picked up orders while we were there and I heard then taking a few delivery orders, so it appears, as others have mentioned, this it more of a takeout place. Nevertheless I was pleasantly surprised with the neat appearance inside. The location sits between a laundromat and a smoke shop, but don't let the whole-in-the-wall exterior shy you away. It's a decent place with good food.What a fun and interesting place! Feels like a little visit to Russia!  They have a great deli and a wide variety of wonderful and unusual bakery items, including some fine Belgian chocolate.Great pizza and wings!  Fast service with reasonable prices.I've been coming here for almost 20 years. I stopped after the first visit, as the place was so smokey. It took me another 5 years before I revisited, and luckily they had become nonsmoking by then. 

Good decent food. Great Philly steak sandwiches. The Stromboli is also very nice. Sometimes a wait, maybe 10 minutes at worst. 

Always cute women servers, but service sometimes spotty. I hate that I ask for a minute or two to look at the menu, and then have to wait 10 minutes to order. I wouldn't care if they got rid of female only servers, as long as they were attentive. 

They usually have a good weekly special for $8 or so, with drink. Lots of sports on, if that's your thing.whenever I go to Wal-mart this is usually my first choice although it is 4 miles from my house, however that could soon change considering they are converting this store into a super-center. the service is alright here, never had any problems.
I have been coming to this location with my family for many years, I was also in a fox special report they did here in 1999 (youtube it!) its great their is also a built-in Subway even though I still go to the one at the end of the lot by Dunkin' Donuts. since they have started remodeling it has been confusing to locate specific items in the store but I'm sure they will get it sorted out once they finish. other than that, no major complaints like some of the other stereotypical Wal-marts in Phx.First off, like what Daren below me wrote, there are 2 Casey Jones's. One offers up free UFC, and this one offers up an incredible local beer selection , and some decent food to go along with it. 

It's a sports bar, and it does it well. And they carry everything, including stuffed pizza sticks, nachos, and my personal favorite, fried cheese curds.

Yes, fried cheese curds. Balls of wonder. 

Go for the beer, the tv's, and trivia on Thursdays. 

Parking is horrific.PV Pain specialists (Dr. Wang) rule!I will agree with everything Calamari F. has to say and also throw in the fact that OMG the kids on LAGUNA BEACH eat at Pasta Pomodoro!!  ;)

But to reiterate, its safe, its predictable, its not that expensive and if you are near PV mall and can't venture too far it is pretty good considering the other choices within the area.  

They get another star from me because the service was excellent  when I have gone there and that makes a big difference to me.  Calamari F. did point out that service has been hit or miss, but they were great the few time I have been there.  I wish I could give 3.5 stars.Delicious Cerviche! I've lived down the road from this place almost 5 months and finally stopped tonight. I did take out just for me. I'm originally from New England and seafood is my favorite and obviously pretty sparse here in Arizona. I saw "fresh seafood" out front and hoped for some cerviche. It was indeed fresh! I got the shrimp and octopus mix. Also got an order of guacamole which was very good too! I will be returning.Have not made it to Shogun in a really long time. This time Monday right after the lunch rush and before they closed before dinner I was really surprised! The chef behind the counter Sergio totally recognized us right away it was comforting to know after going somewhere for 10 yrs falling on tough times and not being able to afford it for 2 yrs that you are still remembered. My tip is to sit at the sushi bar and no where else of course that's if there's an empty seat and you can. Each chef makes the rolls different I suggest you go with the OG chefs that know how to get it done.Consistently good sushi, and great happy hour specials.My children LOVED this place, and so did I.  The waiters/waitresses were so much fun, and the food was great.  This is being written in past tense because we no longer live in AZ, but it was always one of our favorite dinner-time haunts.  Their shakes were FABULOUS, and their burgers were equally as good.  I wish we had a place like that out here.I've been there a few times, and it's good enough to keep coming back. The BBQ lamb is fairly unique, and has a very nice taste to it. The sandwiches come on a bakery-style bun, as opposed to the super cheap hamburger buns you see at most fast-food BBQ places. Not gourmet, but noticeably better.

The garlic mashed potatoes were surprisingly good. Again, not gourmet, but for just over a buck, a nice addition to the sandwich.

There are still quite a few things on the menu I need to try, and I'm looking forward to going back.Sky Harbor has always been an easy airport to get in and out of. It's pretty much a giant loop. And since the renovations and whatnot, it looks awesome. They've even changed up the signage, making signs bigger and brighter. The layout of the airport is people friendly; one can navigate their way fairly easily through it. The people are friendly, and they have a decent selection for food, probably more so when some of the local restaurants are going to open in the airport.Bright, airy and friendly, Phoenix Sky Harbor succeeds at making lots of planes take off and land every day. This was the first time I flew through there. I didn't have to go through security, but the people I overheard chatting commented that security lines always seem shorter there.If you want to look for Paradise Bakery, they moved to a smaller location in Concourse C. The good thing is that they have three registers to try and move customers in and out quickly. 
I just got coffee, water and a zucchini nut muffin. 
Not as good as going to their restaurants, but their food is still on the mark.The view from the top is quite amazing! I took my fiancee up here for a sunrise as part of her proposal, and she loved it!! You really can see the whole valley. As you're driving around Phoenix and have an unobstructed view to the south, you should be able to see all of the radio antennas at the top. You'd be surprised how high you are when you finally up get there. The rangers up there are friendly too. Just as some of the other reviews state though, do WATCH OUT for random bike riders, runners, and various pedestrians on your way up and in. The roads are a little narrow and there is not much room for error.Pretty sure this is not closed, since I go here all the time. I am a big fan of the Pharmacy and the Pharmacist (Brian) is a very cool guy, knows his stuff, and gets things done! Overall I would give the Pharmacy 2 Thumbs Up!When I am hungry for Chinese take-out, I go to Abacus Inn. Located just west of I-10 on Elliot in the Safeway/Walgreens shopping center, Abacus Inn is convenient to most Ahwatukee residents. I've enjoyed the beef with broccoli, sizzling rice soup, however my favorite is the moo shu pork with plum sauce.  Service is super quick. They are always polite. I often have a half-off coupon for second entree since those coupons are in the mail frequently. Its economical even without.Looking for a good gyro joint nearby I was eager to try out niro's gyros, its been there for a while but I had just never gotten around to checking it out.  Well I guess I have only myself to blame for not checking it out earlier.  The gyros are quite good, and contain plenty of meat.  The gyros also pass the required 2-hour post consumption test (they don't wipe you out for the rest of the day :)).  Not the greatest gyro I've had, but a very tasty gyro, and eager to have again.

Niro also serves other chicago style fare (italian beef, hot dogs, etc.) and its good to see the owners behind the counter; quality restaurant.  Catering is also offered.6/15/10
Friend and I ordered take-out: an Arugula salmon couscous salad and a small Four cheese (mozz, romano, fontinella, and feta).  I believe I also requested ricotta on it.  The salad was excellent, although I wished all of the ingredients used were listed on the menu- I had to fish out a couple of troublesome items.  The pizza was fantastic!  And this was after we let it sit for awhile.  (I love my thin-crust pizzas hot, very crispy and fresh-- not cold nor stale, and if it's the least bit soggy, I am heartbroken.)  But Nello's was definitely a hit tonight!  I kicked myself for waiting all this time to go back for another taste.  I'll be returning VERY soon!

Music accompaniment: Dionne Warwick: The Definitive Collection.One of my favorite happy hour spots.  The happy hour food menu is strong and there are drink options for everyone.  The best deal would be the $7 Sake and large Kirin. 

The sushi itself, while definitely not the best in town, is decent.  I've never had anything bad or regretful here.  The atmosphere is always enjoyable and if the weather permits the patio is a great group spot (or just for general people watching).  

You have a lot of choices in this area so I wouldn't go here every week but I definitely would keep it in my rotation.A teacher's Paradise and a place parents should love too.   This is a very neat and well organized store with school supplies.  Lots and lost of school supplies.  From very early development through at least middles school.  I don't understand the method behind the way that it is organized.  But I know that the staff was able to help me find things I was looking for and I had no idea of the name of some of the items.  "Uhm, I'm looking for this card that teachers put stickers on for little kids.  They collect stickers on them as rewards..."   That my dear Yelper is called, "an Incentive Card".  But my point is that  I was looking for several things to donate to a school, but not being a teacher, I had no idea what those items were called.  The staff in that store was amazing.   

They have a rewards buying program, so be sure to ask for the card.  I'll bet anything the sales person won't forget to suggest it.  I have heard some people complain that hte prices are too high.  I comparison shop just about everything on Amazon.com and I found the prices for the items I went in there to buy were comparable.  (If someone knows of an online site that offers cheaper than here, PM me.)The food & wine are good & happy hour is great, but, as nice as our waitress was, she brought our wine & appetizer, but our pizza never materialized.Marshall's is one of those places that appeal to the great bargain hunter in me. If you have the time....because this is not the place to rush in and rush out of. But if you have some time to rummage through racks of bargains...you will certainly find one here!
They have great bargains on kitchen items, cookware, high thread count sheets, towels, housewares and if you are really patient...clothing.
I spend a lot of time on kitchenware so this is heaven for a bargain price- you will sometimes find those same items from Sur La Table or Williams Sonoma here at less than half the price. And if for example 500-600 thread count sheets sets for $29.99 is up your alley....then I will be seeing you there sometime! =0)
Happy Shopping!I'm here a few times a week for small stuff,  but I never do any major grocery shopping because the prices,  like all Safeway stores,  tend to be on the high side.   I've never had any issues with customer service,  and the staff is helpful and nice.   This is kind of a small Safeway so there isn't as big of a selection as some of the newer ones.   Very clean and organized,  and it's had a few renovations over the years to make it a little more modern.We have been using Alma Animal for 10 years. We have always been able to get same day appointments. They have a large English Bulldog clientele, and they are very knowledgable on this breed. Dr. Junger, Vet techs, and front desk staff are all wonderful!I too bought a Groupon and had Chelsea as a stylist. She wasn't to talkative at first but she just went to work on my hair. Super fast foiling! I love it! Had two partials before elsewhere and got a full highlight and love it! 
They did offer me a soda, which is nice! 
I would love to go back but they are a little expensive. My groupon was $55 for full highlights/deep conditioner/hair cut (which I only got a trim) and since my hair was "long" it was an extra $15 (after she started) on top of the $15 tip (since we are suppose to tip on the regular amount )
I would go back if i have cash burning a hole in my pocket :pI recently went came here for a group outing and it was my first time playing laser tag. The staff was fun and energetic which really made the experience great. Since it was my first time doing laser tag I don't have many standards to go off of but we all had a great time and it was very organized. Will definitely be coming back here for future events.I had just been to the Chandler Deseret location and didn't realize the there was a second store nearby.  This too is wonderful bookstore (though smaller then Chandler) where you can purchase both Christian and LDS items.

The only drawback to this location is there is no Lion House Pantry.

Being a non-Mormon, I've found the staff both friendly and helpful and have never been proselytized.  

Since I do have several Mormon friends,  I've found the Deseret Bookstore a good place to go to purchase hard to find Holiday gifts.

Enjoy!This is a great little place.  The atmosphere is authentic enough to feel like it's good mexican, but not fancy enough to feel all conceited about it.  They have some good (unlimited) chips with salsa or bean dip to eat before your meal, and they've got a solid menu full of very reasonably priced stuff.  On some of it you can tell they are cutting corners to save money, but I don't mind because they're passing the savings on to you by not charging too much.  For example, their Chili Relleno is wrapped in a scrambled egg instead of being batter-fried.  Or their fried ice-cream that's just covered in corn flakes instead of a true sweet-crumb batter.  But they still taste great and, like I said, it's cheap.  I ate there last night with my wife and it was $25 for the both of us.  Maybe $30 with the fried ice cream.

Also, they take reservations for large groups.  Sometimes I'll go there after a business meeting so I'll call ahead and get a large table for 12 in the back.  They're cool with that and the service is always great.The menu doesn't tell you what's on their dog so we got our with everything.  From what I can tell it was bean, cheese and perhaps saut√©ed onions. The bun was soft and delicious.  Great dogs.I'll be the first to admit that I am a little bit of a control freak when it comes to my pizza. I like what I like, and I want it how I want it. I'm not particularly daring, and I'm not looking to try some culinary wizardry on a pizza pie.  What I want when I order a pizza is a thin-crusted, doughy, cheesy grease fest.

Streets of New York exceeds my expectations in spades each and every time I order.  Whether my boss decides to call in a couple of pies for an office lunch, or I have a couple delivered to my door because I got way too wild the night before, Streets will leave this un-adventurous pizza consumer fully satiated and feeling more than a little guilty.  

I prefer ordering in to dining in - the service wasn't all that spectacular, though it wasn't a bad restaurant atmosphere.  Be forewarned - it typically takes a while to get a pizza delivered.  I only had one experience where the wrong order was delivered, but Streets was extremely apologetic, let me keep the wrong order, and brought me the correct order very quickly AND gave me a credit for a future order.  Great way to ensure repeat business after an error was made!I was really impressed with this Walgreens!  I went out of my way to go there because it is the closest location to me with a take care clinic inside.  The entire store is newly remodeled. The shelves are all back lit.  The pharmacy and the clinic have monitors to show you queue of people waiting for service.  This way you know if they are working on your script or it will show you when it is done and ready to be picked up.  The monitor for the clinic shows the estimated wait time.  There is also a section with deli foods and snacks that looked fresh and healthy.  The only problem is that the wait between being seen at the clinic an getting the script filled was VERY long.  I've also been to a CVS minute clinic and they put the scripts from the clinic ahead of everyone else as a courtesy.  I wish Walgreens would learn to adopt this policy.Saigon Pho has great and amazingly cheap Vietnemese food.
My favorites are the shrimp rolls (number 2), The Pho Tai soup
(number 12), and the Charbroiled Beef and Egg Roll over noodle (number 25).

It's incredible how many Vietnemese restaurants there are in this desert suburb named Chandler...They have my kind of casual service.  Never overly happy- in your face- bombarding service.  Your waiter asks if you're doing OK a couple of times and if you need anything after that, you just tell them. It's a small place, so they will always be near by.
I always enjoy this honest to goodness Italian food.  I've had the eggplant, the fettuccine Alfredo, calzone and the Sicilian cookie dessert . . .all amazing!I like going to LEE LEE's, They got lots of stuff from home. I'm from Hawaii, so I get to go there and get the Taro leaf,taro,sweet potato and stuff, plus theyget aloha shoyu and New Zealand corn beef  and lots of other international foods.  They got a small bakery in there too that has some pretty good taro bread. I gave them 4 stars cause they're expensive.I used to visit AJ's only for the sweets (Joseph Schmidt's truffles, gourmet chocolates, cheesecakes/bombes, Napoleons, cannolis, gourmet cookies) and the cheese department.  Noticed Philippines' San Miguel beers available here, too (at least they were last year).  Laloo's goatmilk ice cream used to be sold here, but today's visit yielded none in the aisles.  I've always wanted to try their hot foods, but it was only tonight's dinner that appealed to me- salmon with stuffed crab w/ a white cheese cream sauce.  Sides were an awesome scalloped potatoes w/ bacon and cream sauce and very dry-looking "honey- glazed" carrots.  Thinking I'd have dinner elsewhere, I asked only to sample the potatoes, and they were so delicious!  Next time, plans be da*ned, if AJ's serving anything crab-stuffed and those scalloped potatoes, I'm definitely going to dine there!

Other than for the specialty-food counters, you won't catch me shopping here... too expensive!  Better to shop at Whole Foods... Products are less-expensive, many are organic, and you won't find anything with trans-fats!I've had great service every time I was here.  Must have a great customer service program... Same experience at sister company Grand Lux Cafe.

Great honey wheat bread.  Love the happy hour menu (calamari, Thai lettuce wraps, salad).  Try the Lemoncello cake w/ extra sliced fresh strawberries- squisito!!

One of the few chain restaurants I'm not ashamed to admit liking!Had a business dinner here last night, The Sweet Chili Salmon Salad is to die for!!! Nice atmoshpere. It's located at the mall in Chandler, AZ. I would only come back to have the Sweet Chili Salmon Salad only because I would be afraid to try anything else. When you are seated, they give you their standard menu, if you want sushi, you have to request for another menu. Their sushi was so-so. If I came back, I'd opt out of the sushi and dive in for the Sweet Chili Salmon Salad. If you are not into a lot of dressing, I'd suggest to request it on the side. It seemed like they put a little too much. Knocked a star because I wasn't too please with their Sushi selection.Another restaurant Kevin and I frequent when we are out and about in Chandler. Good prices, and the food is consistently good. I love the vegetarian pizza. In fact, their pizzas are all pretty good. Kevin got the nachos last time, which he enjoyed. I am no beer critic, since I pretty much hate it, but since it is a brewery, I can only assume the beer is up to par. The service is also good, and I love how lively it always is, even at ten on a Monday night. I always walk away satisfied and with the confidence that I have not just wasted my money on mediocre food and drinks. Thanks for being a friend, BJ's!Teakwoods is part of our regular rotation. Sometimes, you just want some bar food, and few places I've been to serve it up as well as they do here.

Whether it's wings, a burger or my wife's favorite buffalo chicken sandwich, we've been consistently able to count on a quality meal from this place.

Even though we generally get our orders to go, we have made the time on occasion to dine in and have always been happy with the atmosphere and service. 

This is your neighborhood bar, not some place that the socialites frequent as part of their weekend bar hopping routine and that is just fine with me. There are plenty of other places to go if you're more interested in the crowd than the bar. 

Teakwoods is the place to go when you want something cold on tap, peanuts on the floor, some good wings and an hour or two just hanging out with good friends.I'm a wing addict and have particular tastes in what I like in a wing.  These are now officially my favorite wings in Phoenix (there are some better in NY, but alas I live here now and have to work with what I've got).  I ordered 1 dozen of the hot.  First off, glad to see blue cheese as an option, always a good sign.  Celery and carrots, check.  Good assortment of wings to drums, awesome.  The wings were also a good size with a nice amount of meat on 'em, but not too big.  Best part, the heat was perfect.  Stuck with me for sure, but a good bit of heat while still having great peppery flavor.  Very traditional flavor.  They were nice and crispy, but not overly fried so as to loose some juiciness.  Finally, there was a good bit of sauce on them.  I hate it when there's practically no sauce and I have to ask for an extra side of sauce.  These were coated and just the right amount of sloppy.  Pair that with a good $2 beer and I was a happy girl.I came here for the NHRA Finals on Sunday 10/16/11 and I had a great time. The last time I was out here was about 10 years ago for some Top Fuel Hydro races and honestly, not a lot has changed (except for pricing lol). 
Also I think every ticket is eligible for pit area access now. Years ago you had to purchase a pit pass if you wanted to check that section out. If you do decide to visit the pit area be sure to stand behind a Dragster or Funny Car when they start it up. Its one of the coolest things you'll ever experience although its not recommended for the faint of heart. Once that NitroMethane fills the air around you your eyes, nose and throat immediately start to burn. It wears off pretty fast but its funny to see everyone running towards fresh air while coughing ( I won't lie, I was one of them).
 My overall experience was amazing although its probably better to go during the February races, due to the fact that its still pretty hot out there in October. 
Be sure to bring enough cash because everything is pretty pricey but thats to be expected. I think a large beer was about $9.50. GEEZUS!!! Oh and also plan on spending a good half hour trying to get out of there after the races. If you're not in a hurry to leave try to stick around because traffic is a nightmare right after the final race. You can waste some time by going down on the track, which, by the way is really, really sticky (one of my shoes almost fused to the track :D). Or you can buy some discounted food and drink but its definitely not a good idea to leave right away.First time I ate here, it was 5 stars.  Second time it was 3 stars since the carne asade in my tacos was overcooked .  So I am giving it 4 stars overall.  The rice and beans are excellent and for the money, this place is tough to beat for some quick tacos in a sit in setting.I live right around the corner from LU LU's and it is fantastic. It is a little hole in the wall with a mish mash of restaurant tables and booths. It is not the most aesthetically pleasing place but that's not what gets me to come back to a place. 

Salsa bar is good. Three kinds, very fresh, carrots and jalapenos are all free. Yes chips cost money. The food is fantastic. They serve authentic Guadalajara style street tacos. Yup they are small and like a buck fifty each. They are wonderful. Very very tasty. The chicken, carnitas, and machaca are all fantastic. They have delicious burritos in delectable tortillas. The chicken, machaca, carne asada are all wonderful. The lengua is the BEST! Tacos and burritos! 

If you are looking for a delicious place to eat good Mexican food on a day where you wandered out in shorts and flip flops.......go here. It is definitely worth a try.Me likey. Call me cheap (hey, we are on a budget)(isn't everyone?). But I like the walk-up counter (ala Pei Wei) that has good food and a good environment. This has all of those. Creativity and quality oozes from all of Joe's spots. The menu is constantly changing. The environment is relaxing. And the coffee is taken very seriously. :) Check out each of the different themed bathrooms. 

My wife and I usually split a salad and either a pizza or even a sloppy joe. Then coffee and dessert. If you like bbq, that's right across the street at Joe's BBQ. This is one of our fav date spots.Great atmosphere, good food, and convenient downtown Gilbert location - Joe Johnson doesn't make many mistakes with his concepts, and once again, he has tapped into the right mix of flavor & style.The service at Flancers is great! I put in an order to go and they were very friendly and prompt. I had the prickly pair chicken in a whole wheat wrap. It was very tasty! I did feel the prices were a bit steep,  but their food was good.Great place for sushi and fast, friendly service.

Sushi was fresh and delicious, only downside was that some of the tuna was a bit tough!Even on holiday break with all the Moms and Dads there with their little ones, there was plenty of parking, short lines for the concession and carousel, and room to play on the equipment.  Lines for the train were VERY long, so we were unable to partake that day.Came here for AZ Restaurant Week. This place was completely packed on a Tuesday night, but we'd made reservations ahead of time so we were immediately seated. This place is dimly lit, but not to the extreme where you cannot read the menu without your server pulling out a pen light. That's annoying so things were already off to a great start. 

Everything was delicious. I loved the sun-dried tomato butter that came with the bread. We had very generous servings of the french onion soup. It's the best I've had. It was very flavorful. We ordered the lamb and the fillet Mignon. Both were pretty good. I'm not sure what to think of the mint sauce that came with the lamb. I didn't love it, but I didn't hate it either. We ended off the night stuffing ourselves with a creme brulee and chocolate mousse. We find it hard to say no to dessert. 

The service was great. Our glasses of water and wine were never empty and our courses were fairly well timed. 

I hear they have a great happy hour and I liked the bar area so we will certainty be back for drinks.Wonderful in-room massage by Gina and great service during a corporate meeting. However, the coup de grace was an employee bringing a tray, gratis, of yucca rolls (which are incredible and happen to be GLUTEN-FREE) to our meeting room, after a fellow Celiac Disease sufferer and colleague had raved about them at dinner in DESEO the evening before. I mean, WHO DOES THAT?!?!?
Highly recommend this hotel for corporate meetings and my sister and her family enjoyed a stay here in December one year. Scottsdale is fantastic!Great place to watch football! Staff is on the ball at this place. The food is good and they have drink specials night of the week. I think I found my new place to watch Monday Night Football!I absolutely love this Morton's. Yes a chain, but as a guy, and a steaklover, this is a top notch steakhouse. I was a little biased because I used to live right across the street from it, but that didnt change the fact that its a good steakhouse. A total dark (or dim lit) mood steakhouse with prime cuts of steak. Well aged. Great drinks. Excellent service. One of the better Morton's that Ive been to around the country.Decided to try this venue rather than driving down to their other restaurant on Camelback. We figured we'd have a better chance of being seated here because the other venue is quite small. There is also ample parking. At around 7PM the place started filling up.
We were pleasantly surprised at the amount of space this restaurant had. It was decorated as if we were in Cuba. The server was polite but hardly made conversation, just asked us how the food was and was there anything that she could get us.
We started with Sangria and the Testones, which is grounded green plantains which I thought was a bit dry even with the garlic sauce. We didn't know that it could either be served with a Black Bean dip. As for the Sangria, for me it was potent. Just remember that instead of it mixed with red and white wine you can substitute the white wine with champagne. We weren't even told about those options.
I tried the Sailor's Paella and it had all sorts of seafood: crab, mussels, clams, fish, calamari, scallops, white asparagus and rice. It was served in the pot that it was cooked in, so be careful 'cause you can't dig into until the temperature lowers. The meal wasn't overly salty and was very tasty. If you order this item, don't eat lunch before you come.
My wife ordered the Chicken Chicarrones which was good but a little dry. She took half of them home and had them for lunch.
To top off the meal, I ordered the Flan which was excellent except for the cinnamon cookie on top of the flan. It was different and I left the restaurant satisfied.I came here for AZ restaurant week with a few friends.  If you want an interactive experience, Melting Pot makes you feel like you are cooking without much of the hard work of prep and cleaning.  You need to have a timing system for all the veggies and meats.

The service can be a little slow, but I think its done intentionally to enjoy the moment and the experience.

This would be a great date spot.Best Fry's in Arizona! I love shopping here. Everything is nice and clean and the prices are great especially if you have their V.I.P. card. Their staff is friendly without being fake and I love the layout of the store. After recently moving, I go out of my way to shop here.I stayed here for a business conference this week and was impressed with this hotel.  

The staff here is incredible. Everyone was very friendly, on point, and went out of their way to be helpful and to make us feel comfortable. It's also pet friendly 

The rooms are newer, large, tastefully appointed, and full of amenities. Wifi is fairly quick, and it is included in the nightly rate... (Also, no hidden resort fees here!) My complaints about the room are few... They have HD TV's in the rooms, but the signal is analog, and the mattress was starting to show some age (with wallows, or ruts, in other words). 

My main issue is that this hotel is one that still offers "smoking" rooms. We could smell the smoke from these rooms in the halls and it even found it's way into our room through the cracks in the door. Non-smokers will NOT be happy if you're room ends up next to a smoker.

The public facilities are numerous and great, with the standout being a nice lobby bar stocked with some better names in wine and liquor, especially tequila, and big new HD TV's for watching a game. We ate at the onsite SWB restaurant and tried their "Wine me Dine me" dinner, which was fantastic and a real treat (see separate review for more). The meeting facilities are top notch, and the grounds are very nice.

The pool area is currently being renovated, with only the former "adults pool" now open, and I'm hoping it's going to be renovated as well, since the stone flooring under the lounge chairs is filthy, looking dated and in serious need of a deep cleaning. The pool bar is also woefully lacking in premium beverage choices. Our server was happy to go get what we wanted from the lobby bar, but I didn't ask her to go to that trouble

Overall, the Hyatt RSRS @ GR is a great place to have a conference or to just relax and unwind. It's not perfect, but it's a solid pickMimi's Cafe takes a bit here and there from Puccini's La Boheme, at least thematically. In the opera, everyone is starving until Mimi and her rich, older boyfriend show up and pay the bill at a restaurant. 

That theme goes a long way here because while Mimi's offers good food, it's not cheap and there is some trickery involved. However, Mimi does not die of tuberculosis in the end. Yeah, sometimes they should see the whole opera before pegging a restaurant to the theme. 

When I walked in, I smelled a non-descript, yummy aroma of generic food that had a bit of baked bread, roasted apples, etc. I looked around this modern, air-conditioned building and saw that we were far from the kitchen. Then I looked up. I saw a small aroma atomizer near the ceiling running at full tilt. These devices emit chemical odorants and can be used to make a hotel lobby smell less like a locker room or in this case, to make people feel hungrier as soon as they hit the door. Really? You need to reach that low? At least it was out in the open and not hidden in the ductwork. 

That disappointment out of the way, I have to say the food is good and it's creative. You can have a meal for very little or a lot if you use some self control. The aroma box is designed to skew one away from the simple and cheap toward the heartier fare. But again, the menu is extensive, the food is fresh and it is creative. For a chain restaurant it is different and dishes offer extra touches one just would not expect at an IHOP or similar place. Breakfasts are way more than eggs and gristle tubes (sausages) others serve. The breakfast menu is really good. Lunch is equally creative and very good. 

So apart from the gimmickry of the theme and the aroma box at the door, this is a solid place to eat, converse, relax and get predictably good food at fair prices. I like it. It's not Paris on Anystreet, USA but it's a refreshing theme which works. They don't hit the customer over the head with the theme in decor or on the menu but it's a pleasant change and I will certainly be back.Los Olivos is a good, traditional, Mexican restaurant.  Good food (GREAT Salsa!) in a casual environment - an excellent option for a relaxed meal with good food at a reasonable cost.  Service is always good.  Atmosphere at the North location is more open than their old town Scottsdale location which has more rooms - but food is similar.For some reason I only come here when I'm angry at the world.
And by world I mean my wife. And by angry, I mean eye daggers, not Ak-47's..

Yes, whenever I find myself in that weird place, too tired for a lingering sit-down dining experience, yet not hungry enough for a double Whopper with cheese, I come here.
But not before a series of long and drawn-out interrogatories from my wife.

Her:  "What are you in the mood for?"

Me: "Nothing, I want to go home, have a drink and crash."

Her: "How's Mexican sound?"

Me: "Not as good as a Crown and soda."

Her: "Italian?"

Me: [tightening up like a little kid, facial muscles now squinched] "I want to go home."

Her: "What about, I know, Thai...you love Thai."

Me: [with all the aplomb I can muster] "Can we please just go home?" 

Her: [not talking now, whipping her car into the Chipotle parking lot]

Me: [to cashier] Uh, yeah, give me three Dos Equis Ambers, a bag of chips and some guac."

Her: "Seriously?"

As I said, I only come here when I'm angry. 
Three Dos Equis Amber, guac, chips, and three tacos...twenty three bucks.
The look on her face throughout 'dinner'....not so priceless.Being an avid carb lover, it's safe to say that if it has "bread" in the name, chances are I LOVE it!

Their tomato bread salad should win an award.  Granted, I had never heard of such a thing before, so I have nothing to compare it to, but damn!   It is AMAZING!I joined my husband mid-week while he attended a conference and was not disappointed.  Had never experienced the Four Seasons and would definitely go back.  Yes, it's a hike from parking to your room, especially in cute new sandals, but you can cop out and ask for the golf cart shuttle or suck it up and burn some calories and enjoy their nicely desert-y landscaping.  

Had a great, private room with large TV, separate bathroom area, fireplace and great saguaro populated view.  The internet was awful and the concierge claimed it was because of the conference that was visiting.  Yeah, well, it's $12 a day for bad, slow internet.  That's my only complaint. 

The quiet pool was tremendous with several cabanas available and almost too solicitious service when we were chilling out.  Loved the free strawberry lemon frozen shot and a little fruit tidbit they brought by.  Both meals I had were good - in the smaller cafe for lunch and room service breakfast.  

Other the internet problema, this was a wonderful week and place to spend it in.I have eaten here a few times.  At 5:00 pm the prices change from lunch to dinner.  

You create your own size in a bowl so you can determine your portion.  They do offer menu items, and then have a bar of veggies and meats and sauces at the end.  They have instructions on how you can create certain sauces.

It is too far away from where I live or I would frequent it more often.Usually a bit higher priced than other brands, but generally worth it.Perfect for your wing fix. Sports, Wings, GOOD!After attending a meeting tonight nine of us went to the Golden Dragon for dinner. They serve  "American Chinese food". Everyone got something different and everyone agreed the food here was outstanding. 

Here is my take on this place....I always start my meal with the soup. If the soup is  is good usually the food is good as well. Tonight was no exception. The Wor Wonton soup was excellent!   In addition to my soup I got a vegetable dish. The sauce on it was superb. 

Everyone commented how their entr√©e had good flavors, was served hot and the ingredients used seemed fresh. No one was disappointed with what they got.     prepared perfectly. The food here is great and while it isn't 100% authentic it's very filling, not expensive, had large portions, was served fast and every dish was delicious. I can't emphasize enough how inexpensive it is! 


************************* What does my OVERALL rating mean?*************************

5 stars -Highly recommended.  I would be willing to drive out of my way to this business. It is that good. This place represents their industry or cuisine very well! 
4 stars - Highly Recommended. I would frequent this business. 
3 stars - Not that good but not that bad. Just average. I wouldn't mind going again if a friend or family member wanted to go. 
2 stars - I would not recommend this establishment to friends or family. 
1 stars - DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND DO NOT patronize this business. I would RUN AWAY from this place and you should too! DON'T WAST YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY AT THIS ESTABLISHMENT!This place is Ah-So good and tons of fun. I think it's a little more expensive than it should be but I still go every few months or so. Great sushi and good food.It has been quite a few years since I visited Picture People for portraits and in the past (pre-Yelp), my experiences were mediocre at best. Today we had a great experience and I'm pretty jazzed about how cool my 2 year old's pictures turned out. 

What went well:
**Online appointment process was EASY and problem-free
**Started our session right on time
**Only had to wait 30 minutes for prints to be ready
**Got some very nice shots despite lack of connection with photographer
**Great location--NOT in the mall anymore so a lot less distracting!
**Decent pricing for packages
**Prints were very clear and excellent quality

What I wish would be better when I have a portrait session is that the photographers be less stiff with kids. For a studio that specializes in child photography, my photographer and the other that was working while I was there were both just very stiff when working with kids. Kids won't warm up and genuinely smile if they don't connect with you. But then, most adults won't smile genuinely either if there's no connection. I had to work REALLY hard to get my boy to smile. 

If you have a kid who doesn't smile on command or has a hard time warming up to strangers who are stiff around kids, keep this in mind when working with Picture People. Our portraits did come out beautifully, but not without a great deal of effort on my part.  I will definitely go back because of all the reasons I mentioned above though. The end certainly justified the means. :)Traditional department store set up (Macy's like). Great for shoes! I had never been here before but stopped by when I saw they have Merril brand barefoot running shoes. I had already picked up a pair on sale at Dick's sporting goods ($95) which I thought was pretty good. I was happy to find out Dillard's was much better! ($60). They even had an additional color (which for unknown reasons cost $40 more). The staff was helpful. Enjoyed the time there.Dumplings, Chicken fried steak with gravy. What more could you ask for. Staff was friendly and fast.My family has taken our dogs here for years, but with my recent addition to my family I have finally gotten first hand experience. The staff and groomers here are great! They are always friendly and so caring toward my dog. You can really tell that they care. Further, my dog left looking shiny and new. Not to mention that is shedding less after her brushing. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a dog groomer.Fast food joint....Great at fast food Chinese. Nuff said?  Consistently good fast food is what Panda Express is all about.  If you have a Chinese craving and need to fill that void fast this is the place to do it.  
I like chow mein, fried rice, and orange chicken: the main staples of fast food Chinese. 
Glad to have one in Surprise as a selection for a quick lunch or dinner spot.I usually wait until Wednesday or Thursday to book a tee time, and like to use GolfHub to find good deals. I saw that GolfHub had posted about a $27 tee time that included a hot dog and a drink. I went to the website, and saw that they had $12 tee times after 1 PM. I have no issues playing in the afternoon, so I grabbed a cheaper tee time. I also had a $10 voucher from GolfHub, so my tee time was practically free.

The golf course is not easy to find. Once I found it, I realized they had a pretty weak practice facility. The range is small, and they use distance control golf balls. Their putting green is nice, but I felt the greens on the course were a bit slower than what I was practicing on. Speaking of the golf course, it wasn't in very good shape. Granted, it's summer... but still. There were fairways that I couldn't even hit out of they were so burned up. I also had some flyer lies in the rough... which was sometimes shorter than the fairway. There are also some unfair holes, especially on the back. Regardless, the course makes you think and you have to hit decent golf shots to score here.

The staff was incredible. I was VERY pleased with the way I was treated. I showed up early, and was allowed to tee off before my tee time. The course wasn't busy, and I managed to get around in just over 2 hours. Granted, I played by myself and used a cart. But that is still a fast round. I passed one group all day, and they let me play through. Oh, and the GPS in the cart is nice. They also provided two bottles of water in the golf cart.

For $12 ($2 for me, really) I couldn't pass it up. I am sure the course is in better shape in the winter. It was a long drive for me, too... but I am driving all over the Valley to play. I love it here, and no drive is too far for some quality golf. I would play here again, but I would like to see some better playing conditions. Can't beat the rate, though.Another four star!  We had the 10" gyros at $5.99 each.  Not the best I've had, but very good.  They could have had a bit more lamb and a little less beef to make them super.  But a very good bite.  Everybody's plate looked good - and yes, the place was packed and stayed that way.  We must have been lucky - very good service, very attentive young people at the cash register.  In fact, one made a trail around the dining room asking how poeple liked their food
And clean!  Even the bathroom was clean!If you're looking for Authentic Mexican, this is not your place. But if you're looking for great Mexican-inspired food, this is you're place. Although, a chain, I would consider Abuelos one step up from On The Border, Chevy's, Macayo's or any other Tex Mex chain. The atmosphere and interior alone are more sophisicated. The salsa chips are very addicting. The salsa has a smooth smoky flavor. Also, the enchaladas and steak combo makes a great meal. I always ask for no seasoning or light seasoning on the steak because it's a little spicy. The enchaladas are flawless. And you must try the Papas con Chile! These are mash potatoes kicked up with cheese and peppers.This place is literally in walking distance from my apt. Although i try not to eat here often not because i do not enjoy it but if i did I'd be the "typical obese American" if i did. Its THAT good. But on occasion when i feel like, what the hey, then i spring and splurge on this place. 

The pizza is AMAZING. The wings aren't the greatest if they were this place would of got that fifth star from me. 

Oh and beer might be nice. But then again i know how expensive liquor liscenses are. It's amazing. Anyway, i suggest everyone try this place. BEST pizza in the west valley.I like Baja Fresh!  I can't really attest to what others have said about other locations being better... I have only eaten at this one.  But I've been there about 10 times now and have had no real complaints.  I like the mango salsa.  Yum.This is a great deli. I have been here lots of times and every time it is great food.This time I ordered the soup and sandwich combo.My honey had the pastrami on rye. The matzo ball soup is huge a cup is the size of a bowl! comes with bagel chips. And then i had the half  chicken salad sandwich on halah bread so good.The wait staff is a little lazy and unobservant, the hostess texting when she should be seating people.Food is 5 stars. for the two of us it cost 28$.I was very pleased overall with my first Village Pub experience.  

In waiting for a movie to start, we hit up the pub for a drink and a light meal.  The staff was incredibly accommodating.  We asked about having a snakebite, and while they weren't familiar with the drink (and also not having any cider), they gave us a small beer sampler to try so that we could find a nice substitute.  Seriously, who does that?  Service was just all around very nice and helpful.

In ordering food, I got the chicken wings.  Service was prompt, and they were really good, no, actually great chicken wings.  Probably some of the better ones that I've had in a good while.  They also have a lot of specials, which I would like to try sometime in the future.

Prices were reasonable, for a smoking bar, the effect was pretty unobtrusive, and the decor was very British with its paintings and wood paneling.  The bar just had a good vibe overall, which was complimented by the tasty food and friendly service.

When hitting up the movie theater in the area again, I will definitely stop in for a before or after movie cocktail after this first impression.  I like nice people, good food and beer, and reasonable prices.  Check, check, and check.

Worth a visit.03.23.2013: I used to live in Vegas and this was always my place where I would go. So fast forward about 4 years and guess what? They did not disappoint. This was my wedding day and time had slipped away from me so I called and they told me to come in. I was so happy that this was still "my place." One person remembered me from years back and there seemed to be some of the same people which I didn't expect. The person who did my nails did my nails and did it perfectly. The gentleman who did my feet was great and 1 1/2 weeks later, my french mani is still holding strong.

The price for regular mani pedi is only $35 and with french mani/pedi $45. Not a bad price at all.

BTW, they have the cool chairs that massage your back and on this day, I needed it! Goodness, wedding day and stress, this helped.

I will definitely continue using them when I am in town.Great place for doggie vaccines and a little expensive on medicines. but it balances out. quick and easy.Yes, I am actually reviewing a diner inside and attached to a car dealer (
Ford Country, to be exact)!  I was at the Mazda dealer next door and waiting for my car to be finished and inquired where I could get a bite to eat - who knew?

The reason I felt so compelled to "yelp" about Mustang Sally's is because I'm still having thoughts about my visit - and they are good lingering thoughts!  (If only I could have a date these days that left me with the same impression....)  I had the "Monster Burrito" which was $8.95.  When I asked the server if it was good she recommended and said she'd get the red enchilada sauce put on the side, since my leftovers would then warm up better.  Oh, was she correct - I had leftovers!

I crave mexican food since I've moved to LV from Chicago, where a "burrito as big as your head" is a very common and good late night food!   Well, this burrito was HUGE and unbelievably good.  Rice, beans, lettuce, tomato, cheese, ground beef and sour cream inside with a bit of melted cheese of top - small side of chips & salsa.   I brought the other half home and almost couldn't wait to have the leftover!!  The folks who work at Mustang Sally's were very pleasant as well and kept refilling my water and iced tea.  As I sat at the counter, I watched the food that was being served and I must say it all looked pretty good and pretty large portions as well.

Was this the best burrito I've ever had?  Not THE best - but the best so far in Vegas on my continuous search for burritos and mexican food in general.  (I have a few more reviews to write on the others I've tried.)  But I will say that I need to go back to the dealer before month end and Mustang Sally's will be a DEFINITE part of the agenda for that day!!!This is a good place to eat Thai.  The staff is great and the food is pretty good.  I love their sticky rice.  Be careful the cook makes everything pretty hot, even if you ask them to make it mild (that why only 4 stars) other wise everything we have tried is great.This is one of the two capriotti's I've been too. Which is a bit more convenient for me, since its just down the street from where I live. The second one, is at Aliante Station. 

Focusing on this Sandwich Shop, I have to say that this is unique in it's own sense. There are some things I do like about it, and other things that I don't like. But the most important thing is, their sandwiches are great. I'm not sure about other Capriotti's, but I know that Aliante doesn't have it, but this Capriotti's has their 20 inch sandwich. That's why I like this place I love their LARGE sandwiches. I do like their staff, which is nice and friendly. Despite the fact of them being busy, they still tend to be upbeat. 

On the other hand, even though their location is convenient. Mainly off Craig and MLK next to Pet Smart and Home Depot. It is a small sandwich shop. When it gets busy, its kind of uncomfortable standing around for a sandwich. They only have 3 small tables, and a few worn out chairs. The floor itself, seen better days. 

Overall, I would suggest this place for their sandwiches, but not so much on dining in. They do have a few tables outside, but I would just go their for pick up. Their sandwiches are great, their staff is great. That's all I need to go to Capriotti's for.I have never been here when it hasn't been busy.

They have A LOT of fresh fish options, which my man really likes,
while I like the cream cheesy kind of things....

THEY HAVE BOTH!

The seating isn't really that thought out, and can get crowded, uncomfortable and loud.... that's really the only bummer.Starting to wonder if there's anything this place cant do. 

My cousin told me about a crayfish place next to kim long he wanted to try out. Once we parked the car and looked at the sign we realized that it wasnt next to kim long...it's is kim long.

we both split 3 pounds of crayfish, they came out in two bowls so i'm guessing pound and a half each. Nicely spiced but HEAVY on the garlic which is a good thing i guess. Some of the seasonings were a bit on the heavy side but a swig from a corona fixes that real nice. 

Only down side is when we were served the bowls weren't steaming hot they were just warm, but that could be considered a plus cause we didn't burn ourselves. 

Just a personal thing but i'd like more sausage and potato chunks to bite into every once in a while and there's not enough in one bowl to make me happy.Pho Kim long is great! most places that try to do Vieatnamese AND Chinese food do 1 or the other good, but this place can do BOTH. I love the mayonaise shrimp, and the spring rolls. The crispy chicken has some kind of garlic crust on it that we just love. Try it the next time you are there. Oh yeah, the service is also super fast."Pho Kim Long" You've got to love the name!! I went there about 3:30am. The place was packed. We all had Pho [fur]. The service, price, food, atmosphere were all good!!! Taxi's available.  Would i go back? Yes I have been back enough times they recognize our group.This is one of the places many people go after partying,Great food - a little price,  But portion made up for it. would definitely go back!Last night I had the pleasure of holding an small event at Landry's Seafood House. The event went off without a hitch thanks to Tony Ramieh who was my main contact for the restaurant. He made sure that the drinks and food were all brought out in a timely matter and that dishes were prepared property.

We ordered many delicious menu items off the Happy Hour menu and I will be sure to come back and take part in there affordable Happy Hour.

The staff and atmosphere were delightful as well as the location was easy for our members to get to from all sides of town.If you're expecting great service.. then this is not the place for you. BUT if you are there for delicious tofu soup or all you can eat korean bbq then this is your place. 

All of the tofu soup don't exceed 10 dollars.

You do get all the little korean side dishes if you just order tofu soup and or all you can eat korean bbq.

I think the all you can eat korean bbq is cheaper than most places in Vegas. If i remember correctly dinner time for all you can eat is 18 bucks or so.How I wish there was one in NY! Damn their food is good =) has a warm home feeling, adobo omelet is the business while my girl friend will tell you to get the pulled pork! You can't lose!!! =)Cute little cafe across the street from palace station . We were originally looking for just a coffee place but the neighboring coffee , tea , or me ? place happened to be closed and came across this on yelp. 

When you walk in its more like a diner rather than a coffee shop that I had expected . They have a nice area on the patio to eat as well as two rooms inside filled with old pictures , reminiscent of it's past. You can pick your own seats as well. My seat seemed as if it was going to break which was a little uncomfortable so I switched seats with a table near by . I found that the interior part of the restaurant was uncomfortable so we opted for the patio. The patio area is a nice shaded area. 

I got the frozen white chocolate mocha frappe and the salmon lox. Delicious ! They were both very good and the waitress even gave me a few more capers cause I'm a caper freak. Anywho , service was awesome and you can tell that everyone that works there cares about their customers. A few regulars came in and they greeted them welcomingly asking them how they've been etc . Was nice to see this and they even treated me like I've been going there along time . 

It's cute if you want a nice low key breakfast dinner not so good as a coffee place , but I know now ! I'll be back , maybe I'll be a regular too .When you're in Vegas and you've gotten your share of endless buffets, this would be THE place to hit up for that izakaya you're craving for. It's crowded and their line is long, so make sure you call in advance to reserve your table first! Love the fact this place is like those hole-in-the-wall joints you'd find in Japan with Japanese writings and menu items plastered all over their walls. 

Had lots of good dishes here: Miso Butterfish, Beef Tataki, Tofu Salad with Tuna Sashima, Yellowtail Tartar, Honey Toast.. Highly recommend their tapas. I'd probably skip the beef bowl and shrimp fried rice, those can be too filling and taste was pretty generic. Can't wait to go back and try more tapas and yakitori! This place reminds me of Honda-Ya or Shinsengumi, for those that are also from LA. :)Two words: honey toast. *o*

It was almost closing time around 1am when I came with friends to get some honey toast. When the toast arrived at the table, I was shocked at how ginormous it was!

I figured the honey toast would be the size of the brick toast at Guppy, but it's way better! The ice cream on top just wowed me.

I split this with three other people and my portion was more than enough. I savored every single bite. I evened out the ice cream and honey throughout the toast and every single bite was heaven.

The toast came out to me around $8, a little pricey in my opinion, but definitely good. I  didn't get a chance to order food here so I'm not sure what everything else tastes like.

The service was definitely good. They were patient and friendly even around closing time.Ichiza, hope its just not me but everything I've heard about Ichiza I just can't agree with. You either absolutely love it or you just hate it. I wouldn't say I hated this place more on the side of I expected more from a place so hyped. Obviously this place is over hyped. 

Japanese Dishes: 3/5 I ordered a Gyu don (beef bowl $5.50) I love Japanese beef bowls with a side of Mapo Tofu (spicy tofu $4.15). I wasn't too impressed by their recipe. Most mapo Tofu's I've tried are spicy and the sauce is a bit thick but at ichiza I felt it was really bland and soupy. The Gyu don tasted like a beef bowl, not a Japanese beef bowl it didn't taste authentic, I also felt like something was missing. The portions were also pretty small. 

Sushi: 4/5 After reading a few reviews I thought I'd try the deep fried California roll. I'm not much of a roll person or a deep fried person and California rolls aren't even sushi. BUT it was actually pretty good, I also ordered the Dragon roll which was OVER SAUCED. Its suppose to be eel,cucumbers, and avocado drizzled with eel sauce for a bit of color and flavor, but I think they went sauce happy on my roll. 

Alcohol: 5/5 The famous sake bombs at Ichiza, I suggest don't come here if its a date or a small group. Ichiza is known for big groups of drunks at their low tables slamming on the table doing sake bombs all night long!

Seating: 4/5 I like Ichiza's Japanese style ambiance. You can get seated around the bar (which doesn't give you much elbow room next to the person beside you) or at their tables. I love their low Japanese tables its something you have to try at least once. 

Wait: 3/5 The wait here can be pretty long up to 45 min depending on the time and day you you. On the weekends I know this place gets pretty busy and it's small so seating is limited. Expect a wait.So weird that this place gets such bad reviews. My coworkers and I always come here when we are in town for CES. We have always had good food and good service. I am from LA and we eat at korean bbq joints all the time. And this one is just as good as the ones we go to in LA. I've never done the all you can eat. I've always just gone there for dinner. As long as we are forced to go to CES every year, we will always go to this place for korean bbq.Small, medium, and large are definitely American-sized portions (9", 12", and 20", respectively). I had a small over the course of two meals. The large looked intimidating as the guys behind the counter were wrapping one up for a delivery order.

We visited Capriotti's twice during our four-day stint in Vegas and tried the grilled Italian, Philly cheese steak, and the Bobbie. I'm a big fan of both hot sandwiches and melted cheese, so the Philly cheese steak was my favorite out of the three. It's also one of the better Philly cheese steaks I've had.

Each sandwich was between $6-8 (small and medium sizes). This was a welcome respite from shelling out two to three times more per person for a meal in this town. And the sandwiches were delicious and satisfying! Even the Bobbie, a cold sub, was a delight to munch on since it's basically a lot of Thanksgiving crammed between two halves of a baguette.

The verdict: If you want to give your wallet a break, but your taste buds crave more, head over to the closest Capriotti's and pig out for under $10.By far the friendliest and most enthusiastic greeting I have ever received. Is this how the islands treat everyone because I can get used to this type of hospitality. The day was cold, dreary, and rainy. The service definitely brightened up my party's day. 

I am always craving Korean food and was looking for something on this side of town to meet Katrina M. for her lunch break. My sister and I got there early, so I took the liberty of ordering for everyone. Our very enthusiastic server, and most likely owner, came over to point out some suggestions. Combo plate ($9.90) comes with rice, mac salad,  kalbi, meat jun, and BBQ chicken. Sold, you had me at kalbi. Everything else was an added bonus. Chicken is one of those meats that can be dry, boring, and rarely the highlight of a meal. At Island, it definitely is a contender. Juicy and flavorful. The meat jun was intriguing. A thin slice of beef that has been thrown in an egg batter and browned. It is the first time I have ever had this and it was my sister's favorite off the plate. Brown rice is an option on their menu. We got it subbed instead of regular white and there was no charge. Bonus points! We had also got the bibimnaengmyeon ($9.90). A cold buckwheat noodle tossed in a spicy sweet sauce with radish, cucumber, half a hard boiled egg, and beef slices. I am glad they keep this even in winter. I am usually all for seasonal specialties, but forget that when it comes to this dish. In Korea, this item usually disappears once summer is over. Luckily, not here in Vegas. We had also got the seafood soondubu ($8 something). Bubbling hot, large chunks of tofu, plenty of seafood, and a raw egg dropped in. All good signs... but no kick. I love it best when it possesses a spiciness that can only be remedied with a spoonful of rice. All the dishes come with beansprouts, radish, and cabbage kimchi. The last two items had the same issue, but they were fresh. 

Everyone vowed to come back and try some of the other dishes on the large menu. Even after lunch, I was eyeing the loco moco for next time. 

Hot tea is also complimentary. That is worthy of a mention as well.Good tea. Fair price. Quick service. Just what I needed while in a rush on a hot day.I have had several watch batteries installed here and I've had some jewelry repairs, the reason for today's visit.  My bracelet needed to be soldered where the ring wants to keep slipping off the lobster claw.  A short wait, a reasonable fee, and I was on my way.

I really do like the place and the people.  My only complaint is getting in and out.  It's along the strip side of Chinatown along Spring Mountain Road between Valley View and Wynn Road.  It can be a bit of pain, but I think it's worth it!

They'll get my return business!Great food w/o waiting to long. Can improve on the service. Overall I will come back to this place.Love the soup, the atmosphere, and the Thai tea.Chili's is always good and the prices are all reasonable. I don't frequent chain restaurants very often but when I do find myself here, I always get great food and great service. I can't remember a time when that wasn't the case.

I was just there recently after a long day at work for HH.  Since the last time I was there, it looks like they offered a few new drinks and apps unless I just never noticed them before. I had the mango margarita for the first time and that was so good. It was one of the most perfect margaritas I've ever had! Perfect blend of tequila/sweet/tart ratio. It comes out in a frosty beer mug so I thought that was cool and different. Half of one gave me a good buzz and it was only $5!

The appetizers are always great, you can't go wrong with any of them. The prices ranged from $3-$5. Their nachos aren't your traditional piled on ingredients on a plate, they are individual chips topped with everything you should have with every bite of nacho. I thought this was genius, all the work is already done for you!I am a longterm customer of this Wendy's location. The employees are friendly and the food is fairly constant. They take care of their regulars.

For the most part the dining room is clean. Occasionally, when they are busy, the dining room gets a little messy, but not bad.

Overall, this is a nice Wendy's to visit.No frills, good prices. Located nearby the strip (take Hacienda). I absolutely loved the tediousness that was taken to perfect my pedicure. 

I will be back!It was always good when I came here to eat in the years earlier, but when I came here with my husband, he just thought it was ok. The atmosphere is really nice- don't let the strip mall locale or the funny name fool you. There is a To-Go entrance and a regular dine-in entrance. There is bar seating, tables, and booths. The service was really good. It was a busy restaurant with quite a few patrons every time I came here.

I always got the carne asada plate- it was deliciously seasoned and pretty big- never disappointed me, ever. I should add that I am not a meat & potatoes person, so for me to order, red meat, is saying something. I did take home leftovers (no complaints here). I should also mention that this place was introduced to me by my then BF, who was Mexican. 

Since it was just ok for my husband, I don't believe that I will be coming here anytime soon unless I meet one of my girlfriends here for dinner. Where my girls at?I love this place. I've been looking for a good place to have some food and wine while I write, and this is it. The staff is the perfect amount of helpful and let-me-do-my-thing. I love the tapas plate and a glass of chenin blanc.This hospital is now run by another group and has been called Complex Care Center since last August. My husband was there for 25 days in January and February. By and large, the care was decent. The room was cleaned regularly, the staff was friendly, the food was acceptable. They do rehab about an hour a day if the patient is up to it. The rehab staff was very good and accommodated each patients capabilities.  I found the case worker to be very good about following up. Patients families can eat for a reasonable amount everyday except weekends.  There was a small problem and the hospital followed up and corrected the situation. I found that they were anxious to provide good service and listened to complaints. I would recommend Complex Care if you have a complex medical situation and need extended care. I especially liked Dr Pernell who runs the rehab department. I was also happy that I was allowed to bring our dog to visit.  It was a good boost for my husband's mood.I'm amending my review and giving this place an extra star. This is going to be my regular nail place :)Marche Bacchus 

Non-Descriptly tucked away in a Desert Shores Shopping Center, this place is another great hangout that provides an upscale dining experience in a locals backyard. They only have a wine license so don't expect a Goose and Tonic with your excellent pasta, luckily they have a fully selections of wines nearby for you to enjoy.  The service is excellent, the food is VERY GOOD, and its always  been a positive experience. I have been here 3 times. It's a little expensive but not nearly as bad as you would experience on the strip for the same food. I would recommend to a friend.The food was delicious and the atmosphere was somehow relaxing and romantic all at once.  My husband and I met a small group here on a Saturday night.  Our table was right next to the water on a cold and blustery night.  They had clear plastic tarp-type curtains around the patio and heat lamps.  It was warm and cozy even though we were technically outside.

I would have given this five stars except the portion sizes were rather small for the price.  Otherwise, I will definitely take friends here when they visit from out of town.  I also read that they have a great lunch special during the week.  I will definitely be back to check it out.Ok, so it may not have the posh as some of the restaurants on the strip may have, but Bob Taylors ranch house does offer a great steak meal with a budget in mind.  I was just there a couple of days ago, and I must say the "Diamond Jim Brady" strip was excellent!  Now I won't go as far to say that Bob Taylor's has the best steak, in my opinion you have to go to Chicago for that, but I will say say this place has very good food while keeping the pocket book in mind.  By they way, the appitizer chicken livers are exceptional.  Anyway, the service is very good and the food is excellent when considering the price.  I must say to all new Vegas residents, that Bob Taylor's is a must visit!If you want a good thick piece of steak this is the place to go. The whole family got a different steak and all of them were so good and tasty. You didn't need any sauce to go with them because of the seasoning and juiciness of the steak was enough and perfect! I'm a steak type of gal and even though the place is a bit pricy it's worth every cent. We also got some seafood with our meals and the lobster is pretty big no little baby lobster tail it was a good amount for our entree. Oh and the twice baked potato is to die for!! I usually get fries with everything but here you have to try the twice baked potatoes. The only reason I didn't give them five stars is because the serves sucks! They are all friendly and when they do come around they do help you but they just take forever to come around. But overall great place that's hidden in the middle of nowhere.Yay! I'm a fan of Big Dog's...only if I'm in the area.

At Big Dog's, the portions are just that, pretty big.  Service is always quick to be seated, order to be taken, and food to arrive. Can't give them 5 stars for service because at Big Dog's, they are not the most attentive group.  Once you get your meal, there are times you don't see or hear from a server until your check is given to you.  My suggestion is to do what I always do, order your drink refill early. 

As for the food, it's not bad and the portions are good.

-Sliders: This was recommended on my very first visit about two years ago.  Priced about average (less than $10)' It's still delicious and taste about the same as other pub and grill joints.

-Fish and Chips:  Deep fried and greasy.  Poke a couple of holes in the breaded fish and drain the greasy out first.  Now you're takin'.  Now it's at least edible.  I think the batter is a little too thick and takes away from the taste of the fish.

-Steak:  Not a bad option, but it's a little dry.  However, it's cheap and you get what you pay for.

-Pizza:  Has to be over 2 years since my last pizza here, but it's cheap and one of their better prepared items here.  For less than $10, a personal pizza here is tasty and not too greasy.

-Burgers:  2nd favorite to their pizza.  Their burgers are stacked, juicy, and affordable. 

I never expect much at Big Dog's because the prices are cheap and it's basically pub food.  Portions are big and there's still enough on the menu for everybody.This is the first place in Vegas that let me book my shows. They started it all for me. I like this place but never work things out with them where it profits us to play here. the bands love this place and beg to play here. They get some huge acts sporadically coming through here also. The drinks are affordable and the sound is excellent for a medium sized club. I will always like this place and support them, long live The Cheyenne Saloon!!! "PAN"Kerr'y is an excellent place to go for lunch.  The menu has a good selection, and the prices seem to be on par with every other place.  From the flyers they have posted on and around the door, it looks like Karaoke on the weekends gets pretty crazy.  The staff has been friendly every time I have been there, and the service is excellent.Had dinner there last night while waiting for my car's oil change at the dealership next door. It's a tiny restaurant but the food is excellent. Love the little touches with the carved veggies. I had the Mara Nee Krob (hope I got that right). Crispy pork bites with broccoli rabe and an order of pork fried rice. Great portions and even better flavor. I will be back.Talk about throwing it back old school for me. I still remember oh about twenty years ago first moved too Vegas would frequent Shark Pool Hall with roommate go shot pool and drink after work. Times have changed with lot more pool halls across the valley. It was my first time coming too Cue-D. I really had no expectations expect keep my early yakudoshi party going night. It located in the perfect spot comes too finding some great asian food off the strip. After great night at Wendy decided too keep the party going across the street. The only downfall feel for all the shops in this little strip mall is parking suxs! It can fill up supa fast but if all else fails can park across the road then walk over. 

Pool Hall its not Huge Huge but just overall nice size. Think something like over 15 tables in all. Not the full size regulation tables. Who need regulation really going there too drink and play pool with friends? Lol! Drinking about steal of deal. I believe from 7-10 running special two dollar beers. The catch was fact not your typical cheap flavorless ones they had few nice craft beers. Me and roommate went for the Shock Top. Really for $2 that is SHOCK of price no pun intended. The bar area itself is nothing too brag about just your basic hole in the wall feel for bar. The service is awesome. The moment walk in ask if playing pool, games or hour, many tables, and really on it. The tables for really looks like hole in wall place are really nice. The felt are nice all around or could tell on all the tables (no rips, clean, and tables are all leveled right). The house sticks most part straight not warped or abuse much being house  sticks. Each table nice table area you can place your drinks and whatever else bring, The jukebox something that cool surprise! You can play whatever music in the mood or rocking pool game on. I like the fact that the tables have nice amount of space between tables or feels like more then normal?

The only thing need too be prepared for is NO CASH. They do have ATM right next too the bar, We had too use because first timers had no clue. 

Definitely fan of Cue-D. If ever have urge too go shot pool really this place rocks for bargain and love hole in the wall places in Vegas.If you are uptight and bitchy, don't come here! Go to a place that charges a cover and $12 for a well drink.  If you can relax and enjoy yourself without worrying if someone's LOOKING at you, this is a fun place to go to. Wed nights are biker nights. If you have a bike, then you know what to expect. I go on Tues nights, which is Hot Rod Tues brought to you by one of the main Mutts at Mutt & Jeff's Classics. The parking lot gets packed with classics, rat rods, and even some bikes. So what if the chick behind the bar wears her underwear to work??? What ever makes her the extra cash. And it's not like she's a beast! She's very nice. And don't complain about the owner being a skirt chaser. Take it as a compliment! You can say 'no thank you' and he'll be fine, and so will you, geez! Like I said, if  it's easy for you to get your panties in a bunch, don't go. Simple. Their food is delicious and on Tuesday nights, it's the best $1 tacos short of making your own at home, and even then I think you've got some competition!!! Full bar, sports on the flat screens, rockin juke box. Hey, ever since The Cooler Lounge closed, this is pretty darn close to the good times we had there!!! Everyone is super nice.Got their chicken and pesto pizza. Very good and filling. Not busy in there at all.OK, I have been a fan of Pizza Pit since one of my first trips to Madison soon after getting my driver's license. Back then Pizza Pit was a mini-chain around Madison. Most are now owned by individuals. Oregon's Pizza Pit is one of those individually owned and luckily use the Pizza Pit formula. I just like their crust and sauce. The crust is thin, but not too thin and the sauce has that rich taste that I like for Pizza. A good mix of ingredients on the pizza. Their service is good.I was quite overwhelmed with the amount of soap in this store. I'd hate to see the bubbly mess if the store was flooded. Whatever it is you are searching for it has to be in this store. It has many of your natural brands that can be hard to find in certain towns.While perusing the bombers of beer, the clerk behind the desk told me to get a certain beer brewed with spruce, because "it is like getting hit in the face with a forest."  Being a sadist, I try to smash my face into a pine tree at least once a year, and I thought adding an oral element to it might up the arousal effect.  The beer was pretty good, but unfortunately, it did not hurt.

They don't have any alcopops (like Mike's), which means that to get both I'd have to go to 2 stores.Amazing soups! Wonton and noodle is my favorite combo, and their hot and sour soup is also delicious.

Besides New Seoul, they have the best kimchee I have found in Madison.

BBQ Pork Buns and Pot Stickers are also very tasty.

I went in for lunch today with a cold and left a cured woman! The server was friendly and didn't rush me at all. Lovely.Bandung's food exceeds expectations.  Although it was slow for the waitress (who turned out to be the helpful and cheery manager) to get to us at the start, everything else came in a timely fashion.  The spring rolls are amazing, we had to order seconds which swiftly came out.  The chicken pad thai claims "best in town" and I couldn't agree more.  Definitely check this place out!Whether you are a Madison local or stopping by from Chicago or parts unknown for a weekend visit, you must make Tornado Club one of your stops.  It is a supper club frozen in time; upon entry in the bar you would not be surprised to see Don and Betty Draper, Don swigging an old fashioned, oblivious to Betty's obliviousness.  You'll be tempted to have an old fashioned or three yourself, and dive into their world of oblivion, but not before getting yourself some serious meat.

First, the decor.  As I alluded to above, the bar is straight out of the forties, with gorgeous curves, and, as a I recall, a smooth marble top.  The bar "stools" are not stools at all but gorgeously upholstered captain's chairs.  We arrived just in time for our table, but were sure to spend a couple hours after dinner at the bar.  The bartenders are very friendly, and well versed in, dare I say it?, mixology, creating some old school aperitifs after the desire for Manhattans wears thin.

The various dining rooms - of which there are, I believe, three - have a similar vintage vibe, one with wood paneling on the walls and another, the one we dined in, with an arched, plaster coated ceiling, old time wall sconces, and a fireplace.  For my money, THIS is the room to dine in.  It feels like you are in a country lodge eating freshly killed cuts of meat.

And those cuts of meat here are great - I had the venison tenderloin, seared in a red wine sauce.  It had the smoky, gamy notes you expect from a quality cut of venison, and the red wine sauce gives it a hit of primal bloody flavor that knocks the dish out of the park.  It was so rich it was a struggle to finish but I barreled through.  Kelly had one of the steaks, and it was prepared a gorgeous medium rare, slightly crispy on the outside and oh-so-juicy on the inside.

After dinner, I sampled the extensive bourbon and rye selection at the bar, and capped off the night with a well-crafted Italian digestif.  If I lived in Madison, I'd be here a couple of nights a month, if not more, without a doubt.  This is a dining establishment to be proud of!

PS - As a fun aside, check out the Tornado Club website some time when you can have your speakers on - www.tornadosteakhouse.com - it has an awesome loop of space age bachelor pad music.  Makes me want to fix myself a cocktail right now - gotta go!The main reason I go to Tornado is for their frog legs. Incredible. The entrees and the rest is fine, I'm sure, but I really have trouble seeing beyond the perfection of those magic frog legs.I love going to Delmonico's whether it's for cocktails or dinner.  I don't get to go often but when I do I love it.  The atmosphere is wonderful and the service is great.  I love their steaks but never hesitate to go for the scallops either.  I always start with the shrimp and it's always good.  We generally end with the chocolates and are never disappointed.Mmmmm breakfast. Sourdough has great bread and breakfast options. It also appeared to be pretty pet friendly, with too small pooches hanging around their owners (one of which was in a stroller...but that's en entirely different story). 

Anyway, I had the granola that was incredibly flavorful and paired with a nice creamy yogurt. Boyfriend had 2 thick slabs of brioche french toast with berries. It was all very good with speedy service and easy table finding on a Saturday morning.Ok - I'm going to go with four stars because this is one of the very few places  that I've found you can go for a late night dessert and coffee. The coffee doesn't stand out but the desserts yum! The best part is they don't make it feel odd just coming for the sweets.My boyfriend used to work here and feels weird about coming back. So unfortunately I don't get here as often as I like. Which is a very unfortunate thing. I love their food. It's just so amazingly good. I wish it were cheaper. I ALWAYS make sure to stop by their booth at Taste of Madison to get my chocolate chip cookie dough egg roll fix. Way back in the day my boyfriend's family got the cookbook and I got a copy of the Tomato Chicken Tarragon soup. I make it all the time. Maybe some day in the future I'll be able to convince my boyfriend to come here more often.

Oh, and I love all the stories I've heard about the owner. He sounds like a great guy!It seems like most other folks who stayed here, I got my room on priceline (for $50). I was also rather annoyed that priceline considers this hotel to be downtown Madison -- but that was my fault for not looking closer at the map, not the hotel's fault.

This is a great hotel though. The rooms are big and comfortable. Parking and wifi are free (as are cribs). Service as friendly and quick (almost over the top). They have a nice pool and a free shuttle service (that I did not use).

I also like that if you forgo maid service you get a $5 voucher that you can use at the restaurant or starbucks.Hotel was ok.  Clean and nice staff.  Breakfast was good.    Waffles, cereal, fruit, hard boiled eggs.  

Pool looked ok... With hot tub.   

Wish the bathroom was a little bigger and they need some sheer curtains.I really enjoyed my stay here. The room was really clean and the staff was super friendly and helpful.

Parking was also a breeze and free.

I love the breakfast. I love anywhere that serves a free breakfast but I really liked that the Clarion had such great options.

If I was ever in the area again, I would definitely stay here.I don't think I can emphasize enough how much easier (and just overall less stressful) of a time it is to come here on a mid-week weekday.   Service is better, food is better, drinks are quicker.Rocky's has great Pizza. This location has a movie theatre and an arcade--great for kids.Food was good and hot, waitstaff nice. Will be back!The Hyatt is a really nice hotel.  It's conveniently located close to the convention center and right across the street from the symphony hall.  

There is a business center, gym, several ball rooms, as well as meetings rooms within the hotel.  There's also a cafe and bar/restuarant to feed and nourish your hungry and thirsty souls.

The elevators are extremely fast almost too fast to stomach.  The view was really beautiful in my room on the 18th floor.

What I didn't enjoy the whole weekend was the fact that the main light in my room was out the entire weekend.  I mentioned it the first night and they never came to change it out.I came across this place when another local restaurant refused my coupon. I was glad I did.

The Good:
Really tasty burger, nice and bacony with fresh toppings. Lots of fries to the order. Fast service; what, were they expecting me? They were very friendly, too. The place was clean, which is always a plus.

The Bad:
Only 4 packets of catsup, not nearly enough for all those thick fries. The '50s music, not a fan, got it to go.


The Ugly:
Not very green; they provided in my to go bag a cutlery wrap with a twist tie. Nice touch, but I don't need a fork and knife for a burger and fries and the twist tie just seems wasteful. Also, their hours; It's rare that I'm in town this time of day, normally I get in late and leave early, so I can see that many times I won't be able to eat there because they're open 0730-1430. 

Their menu seems to have something for everyone. The Greek food (being consumed by the girl by the door) looked really good and she was eating it as if it were. Six different dogs to choose from, 7 burgers  and 9 salads on the menu. They do breakfast as well.

They say they've been serving since 1939 and I'm sure they'll be around for a long time, 'cause this is good food, people.What a sandwich! Not a lot of frills, and the sides are underwhelming, but if you just want a really good toasted sandwich for lunch...Sticklers will hit the spot. 

And it's downright cheap!

The only reason this place doesn't get 5 stars, is because the service was a little course, and the place was REALLY busy without a lot of seating space. Plus, it's only open 'till 4 PM! And not at all on weekends! DOWNTOWN RESTARANTS THAT ARE ONLY OPEN FOR LUNCH ON WEEKDAYS DRIVE ME CRAZY!!!!!!!!

Come to think of it, the fact that I was willing to give it 4 stars despite all that is a testament to how awesome their sandwiches are., because there aren't many other good things to say about it.Friendly and helpful staff and TONS of costumes to choose from!Cash only! Good food. Prices are up. Been going there for more than 10 years always good food. Red chile is my fav and you can put it on anything. New manager has made some good visual changes and menu changes too! 

Loyal customer.Very good food!!!!!I purchased a chaise lounge last week, and finally had it delivered the day before yesterday.  I worked with Ingrid, through their online chat.  She was very helpful!  I love my chaise, the delivery guys were nice too.  My only small complaint - which is the ONLY reason why I gave them 4 stars - is because I can't just purchase things from their website directly.  I enjoy the whole concept of clicking and receiving, so this is just a personal thing for me.So happy to find this little gem in our neck of the woods -- but also well worth the trip from anywhere in the Valley. 

For those interested in supporting local establishments put this one on your list. It's family owned for over 30 years and the owners live in Laveen. It's easy to get to but a bit tricky to find only because it's located in an industrial area and you think you may have made a wrong turn. The inside is remodeled - clean, friendly, and homey. 

Ross and I tried the chorizo and cheese omelet (served with tortillas) because of the Yelp reviews below and we were not disappointed. YUMMY. We also tried a Texas-sized pancake...HUGE....seriously. Next time we hope to try the Chilaquiles! 

Awesome service and great food!The place had beautiful jewelry but it just seemed no one wanted to help us and the woman that greeted us and worked with us was anything but helpful. She seemed irritated to have to deal with us. They will not be getting our business.See, all my friends but one hate this place. I always beg and plead for Mi Patio, but no one ever wants to go. The complaint is always the same, that the food tastes like soap most of the time. 

And then it dawned on me.

The only other person who likes this place as much as I do usually also leaves as tanked as I do.

The $1.25 margaritas mentioned before absolutely do their trick.

Call me a boozebag, call me easily distracted, but I loooove Mi Patio.mi patio has no patio. oxymoron?????


this would be a 5 star review minus the non-existent patio, which i believe is essential for sunday beer/margarita drinking. i've been here a few times and have never been disappointed. their food is good and cheap, and like all good and cheap mexican food, gives you the shits the next day. i ordered their appetizer sampler once, which was delicious and filled with lots of little tasty treats. their cheese enchiladas are gooey and delicious. everything comes with beans and rice. the beef tacos are shredded and come in crunchy shells, just how i like them. and the chips and salsa are never ending. mmmmmmmmm

their margaritas are delicious. i think it was like $10 for a big pitcher of them. they also have a variety of margaritas, not just plain ones (try strawberry, mmmm my fav, very tart), and a variety of other drinks as well. every time i've been in there drinking, they've given me and my friends a free shot. maybe so we drink more? who knows, but a free shot is a free shot.This is where my current boyfriend took me on our first date. Now, I will say that if I was the same woman then that I am now, he would:

1. NEVER have had the opportunity to get in, near, or about my pants
2. have been slapped mercilessly
3. been the receiving end of many, many disparaging pieces of gossip (true and otherwise) via myspace as well as been the victim of prosecutable slander.

BUT, since all of 2 years has turned me into a sensitive little WASPy, corporate, salsa-making, bottle-recycling cupcake, I will review this like I felt that very first date:

"It's stinky, it's divey, it's cheap, and I don't know a goddamn person here. I LOVE THIS PLACE."SACKS should be called, "Have a yummy sandwich and surprise! There's a cookie too!" During lunch its filled with downtown Corporate America and our brains of the world from St. Joe's Hospital - its right across the street.

Look at this line!! Holy shit! Calm down! The order board is gynormous, so you'll know what you want as soon as you reach the register.  Well you better anyways. First timers, its kinda overwhelming. Take a deep breath, its just a sandwich. 

Parking and seating might be an issue. Luck was on my side today. I might just hit the Casino now.... or take a nap.Just got done eating and I will say their pizza is superb, great sauce, tasty cheese. I also partook in the mild hot wings and they are terrific as well. Delivery was fast and the food was hot and ready. Overall delicious.Yes Dairy Queen ,an American Favorite. Everyone loves DQ!
 Though over the years the lce Cream has changed, but what has not.
It is a cheap place to go , to get some old time fav's!
The Dilly bars and Buster Bars are still around and still pretty good.
Though I would like a little more fudge on it.
The place is very clean and the staff friendly and helpful.
So very much worth a stop in.I'm a Starwood Platinum, so I get around to alot of Sheraton properties.  This property, while old, showed some signs of updating.  It's a great location in terms of freeway access and the grounds are quite nice for being located close in Phoenix.

Front staff was very helpful.  The room was nice with a big plasma but like most hotels, no HD programming.  Not sure why you have a great TV and only offer standard channels.  

Overall, I'd stay here again.  I would think it's more of a business hotel but it's also a great central location to explore Phoenix from.I went here for lunch with the coworker. I would prefer this over Panda Express any day. Got the teriyaki chicken bowl with the fried rice with white meat. It was pretty good. The chicken actually taste like real chicken and not all mushy like Panda ExpressOn the recommendation of iain B. I took Bo in for his check-up, vaccines and a grooming. I was pleased upon walking in. The traditional antiseptic vet smell was not present. The Lobby and the exam rooms were bright and clean. In glancing through out the facility I noted the cleanliness through out. 
A few cats in carriers with their owners waited but were quickly received and greeted in their exam rooms. They also had 2 cats roaming freely keeping every one in check and were the true managers of the place. :P They were very polite and friendly. The folks here were friendly, they discussed the option of sedation for the grooming, which I was against, and asked instead for a call if he became unruly and I would just come and pick him up as is. 
Luckily it did not come to that. Turns out he was as the Tech/Groomer described him a "total meat loaf" and let her comb away. I picked him up and he was calm and about 5 lbs lighter with just the combing...maybe next time a shave? We'll see how the early stages of summer treat him. 
In closing, for those with cats I would recommend checking it out.The place to go if you need supplies for any party or event.

They have everything from balloons, napkins, toys and party favors, to wedding supplies and costumes. They have everything well organized by events and themes.  If you want a Spider-Man or Disney princess themed party, they have everything you need.

WARNING...You may catch yourself playing with all the little party favor toys they have in bulk bins!Lenny's burgers are fantastic.  One of the best burgers out here.  They are a bit pricey especially charging extra for the cheese and fries can add up to $10+.  Overall good place to get an occasional burger from time to time.I am not a Chinese expert by any means but I thought this was a really good lunch spot. Sketchy looking for sure, but fast, friendly service and the food was really good. I had the moo goo gai pan lunch special. All the veggies were really fresh. Chicken, of course, looked questionable but I've never had Chinese food with "good" chicken. Fried rice was good although no eggs or veggies in it. Egg drop soup very salty but good and the egg roll was crispy. All for $6. I'll definitely be back.A typical Red Lobster, exactly what you would expect. The wait was typical for a restaurant in this area on a Saturday.

The reason I'm commenting is that I thought the hostess was really nice and did a great job. While we were waiting she dealt with some rude people and did a really good job. I think her name was Missy or something like that.

The restaurant was recently revamped and looks really nice on the outside and inside.Foods quality is good the atmosphere is not that we'll appreciated. :)

1 advice.
 = drive through then eat it at home.This place is pretty legit and always packed. They haven't perfected the carne asada but it gets the job done. Everyone I know here loves this place.Stopped in last Saturday night for a late dinner. Was pleased to sit out on the nice patio. Enjoyed some live music and a pitcher of red sangria. Delicious. The service was spot on for sure. As soon as we were seated, we received water, fresh/tasty chips and a verde salsa. The waitress was very attentive but not overbearing.

My hubster ordered beef lazy tacos and I had the waitress surprise me with anything off the gluten free menu (except salmon). The tacos, per my husband were delicious. I received chorizo stuffed chicken. It was fabulous. I would have liked a little more spice in the sauce and more excitement in the grilled veggies, but otherwise for a gluten free meal - amazing. There were a lot of gluten free options. I was very grateful for the menu and the knowledge of the staff.My boyfriend & I just recently discovered this Outback just a few blocks from our place. We've been there twice, and both times we have had excellent service. The food is very yummy. Our favorite is the Bloomin' Onion, we'd go there just for that. Both times we've been seated quickly, and received our order promptly. I highly recommend this Outback Steakhouse. Yummy!Stopped in earlier this week and enjoyed eating there. Friendly service, food was a little above average, but wine selection is pretty limited. Will def. come in and try some other dishes soon.fast, friendly and had what I needed at a good price!!I went there last night and really had fun. I'm not the biggest fan of tons of televisions playing sports games, but if that's your thing, you'll give it a five star review.

We got the Asian wings, which were delish.  There's nothing over the top or extravagant here, but then again, that's what you should be expecting when you walk in the door. I got a flavored Mojito, and it hit the spot. Our server was really helpful, and handled our table of 15 well.

My friend played the game where you try to catch stuffed animals with a claw, and he actually got one, woohoo!This place is hip with walls adorned with funky art from local artists.  Their food is out of this world; same goes for their wonderful coffee.

I usually go there in the morning on weekends for breakfast.  My favorite is their Monaco omelet and Mexican Coffee.

I would give this five stars if 1) the owner would take the time to actually crack a smile.  Her chilly demeanor can be intimidating.  And 2) if service was better.  There are times where I would have to wait forever before being acknowledged.So we wandered into Pita House on a Sunday afternoon. It's small and unassuming. It plays techno Middle Eastern music, shows Egyptian pride commercials on their one TV and the walls are painted to look like they're cracked stone and like you're in someone's pyramid basement. 

AND IT IS DELICIOUS.

The falafel. THE FALAFEL. Perfectly crispy on the outside and deliciously falafely on the inside. Three tasty falafel patties stuffed into a tasty warm pita with veggies and tahini sauce. As someone else noted, their very simple salad (uhh, lettuce and a tomato slice) is topped with a dressing made of the tears of fairies and hopes and dreams.

The tahini was added slightly on the heavy side for my liking, kind of drowning my whole falafel pita, but that's my own fault. I generally ask for it on the side and it just skipped my mind this time. No big deal. We were the only ones in there for a while but 5 or 6 other tables came in while we were finishing lunch. There was only one girl running both the dining room and the to-go shack (who looked about 15 years old) but she was taking care of everything pretty easily.  Pita House is a perfect cheap lunch decision and...I might need to get down there this afternoon.The best way to describe Giligin's (intentionally misspelled) is with an anaolgy:

Jerry Springer: TV; Giligin's: Scottsdale.

I respect the anti-Scottsdale stance they take at Giligin's. Dress code is way out the window as is any sort of typical formality at even the most casual of bars. 

Jello shots, stiff cocktails, and, no joke, midgets are all part of the Giligin's mystique. The Wheel of Misfortune is funny and certainly entertaining, but borders on sickening when they bust out the food (Hint: some of it is still alive). 

I actually prefer the non-Fear Factor nights, when I can go and be trashy but not feel sick to my stomach about it.Parents Review: first off, excellent attempts by a former "senior citizens" property to become a destination for families. The splash pad, slide and kid activities are well thought out and great. I hope management reads this because there are just a few changes that need to be made to make the property truly family friendly. 

First off, the splash pad needs to open earlier. Kids are up super early so to have it open at 10:30 is brutal especially during the summer when it's hot. The menu at The Terrace needs to include more kid friendly options and the overall hours of kid activities in general need revision. Open earlier,  close earlier please.

Otherwise,  our family will be back. We had a great time and the rooms are a great size and pool view rooms are still nice and quiet. We love the phoenician and will continue to make it our go to staycation location :)A little kitschy, a little run down, but the food was delicious!

The menu is massive. You could bring anyone here and they'd find something to eat that they are into. I had a veggie burrito, boring I know. My neighbors had fajitas and everything smelled wonderufl. I admit I had a little order envy. 

We had a huge group, about 20 people and they handled us with ease. Service was cordial and quick. I thought it was a leeeeeeetle weird that they use table salt for the rim of the margaritas.I found the staff here to be very friendly. One of my favorite things to do is just lounge around and drink a glass of wine. I love to try new stuff and our waitress was so helpful in making a great suggestion for me and my boyfriend on some flights. The wine book (Something this thick can't really be called a menu) is huge and entertaining. It's weird that so many of the tables were 'Reserved' even though this place was pretty dead, but they gave us a great small table in some comfortable chairs in a corner. I can't wait to come back.After week of coordinating with a newly created yelp - foodie group, we decided that our first visit will be at Cowboy Ciao. I haven't been to CC for over 10 years, and I am glad I came back.
Our server, Nancy was amazing, funny, and on point at all times. She did mention it was restaurant week, but we mentioned her what we were there for and she had some recommendations for us.
Our group shared the truffle mac and cheese, mushroom pan fry, pork chop, pork belly, and the flat iron steak.
Nancy was very diligent making sure we pair our food perfectly. First came out the pork belly and the truffle mac and cheese. Every bite was delicious and went well with each other.
Second came our main plates: flat iron steak, pork chops, and the mushrooms. I would go back just for the mushrooms alone and the sauce. 

I decided to wash down this decadent food with the wine flight CC was offering. 

I would definitely recommend this place for an intimate date night. You cannot go wrong.

And a huge thanks to our server Nancy!!!I came here as part of a food tour we took during our stay in Scottsdale. We tried their pulled pork tacos and homemade chips and salsa, everything was DELICIOUS!!! Our guide also told us about happy hour taco night ( I can't remember when it is) but next time we are in Scottsdale, we will for sure have ourselves more of their amazing tacos!!!Love the breakfast burritos!Even though PF Changs is not real and authentic Chinese/Asian food and a chain, I will give some credit to some of the food I had last night.  My buddy and I went there just for the hell of it, as I haven't been to one in years.  I got a PF-X drink, which I highly recommend.  It has some mango rum, sprite, and something else that gives a well balanced drink.  He got a pear mojito which was okay, since I am not a big fan of mojitos.  We sat at the bar and got incredible service and attention from the bartender there.  I give an extra start to PF Chang because I think they value customer service.

As an appetizer we got chicken lettuce wrap.  It is a diced up chicken in soy sauce that goes into an empty fresh lettuce.  To complement our dish, our bartender made a sauce mixed with soy, chili pepper, and mustard.  This added a nice kick to our lettuce wraps.  

My man dish was the mahi mahi with lemon grass cilantro brown rice.  The lemon grass was almost as good as lemon grass from a Thai restaurant, and that is saying quite a bit.  My friend got the honey glazed chicken, which was okay.

Overall was a pleasant experience.Love this place! Like the lay out and the different rooms. Love to dance there. Gets pretty crowded.We found our new Sunday night spot! This place is perfect for any type of crowd... rock and metal (downstairs) while hip hop heads and sha sha shake it girls (upstairs). Cheaper drinks than most of Old Town. Bouncers aren't dicks. Aaaaand there's a big panda that walks around and dances with everyone. DOPE.Rich in the print center is a lifesaver!

We came in at the 11th hour to get an important proposal printed. Rich was patient and helpful and let us know that an immediate printing would not be possible due to the time of day, but that he would come in early and make sure that our 7 packets would be printed on the correct paper and collated by our deadline. It was very refreshing that he cared enough to make sure that we were satisfied customers instead of simply sending our business elsewhere.

Everything looked great and we could not have pulled off our presentation without his help.Just got back from Carlsbad Tavern.  It was good.  Great service.  Fun atmosphere. Kid friendly.  Loved their black beans.  My husband loved his fish taco salad.  I liked my meal.  I wasn't excited about my food like my husband was.  My only suggestion to them would be to add more vegetarian options without relying on cheese.I really liked this place. Not only is the atmosphere great, so was the paella! Plus they had flamenco dancers shakin' their hips through the place at random moments...how fun is that? Later on they actually performed on a little stage. The best part was when they ask who was having a birthday, and I pointed out my whitebread, farm-boy Minnesota-born husband. They pulled him right up there so he could shake his groove thang. Highlight of the evening.When I'm cruising PHX and can't make it to Sakana then I come here.  

Friday and Saturday nite is like a frat party.  By now, any night in Scottsdale must be like a frat party.  Go midweek, sit at the bar and enjoy the quality of this place.  See you next month.go for the screamin lunch menu!  all the usual fare for $3.50 and up.  plus it's in a nice area and the decor is pleasant.

you can get the same stuff in a styrofoam bowl at those other places but why not eat it out of a bento box and look stylish at the same time?

not earth shattering but then again, it won't cost you and arm and a leg...Small authentic Mexican restaurant nestled in old town Scottsdale. We sat on the hidden outdoor patio that offers plenty of shade from the merciless Arizona sun.  We arrived around 1130 and the patio was wide open but by noon all the tables were filled with locals and tourists alike.

Prices are very reasonable, around 8-10 bucks each and we enjoyed a couple of great margaritas in the warm Arizona sunshine.  The chicken tacos were good, but the standout was the soft chicken tacos covered in poblano cream sauce - unbelievably good.  We also liked their chips and salsa.

Service was a bit uneven but we didn't mind, it was great to escape the winter and just bathe in the warmth.Regulars pull rank on the songs with the Mr Karoake dude running the show. But if you stick around, your song will come up eventually. They do need a better sound system. But hey, if you drink enough everyone sounds the same :) Generous pours and decent food.Boyfriend and I from SoCal stumbled across this nice lunch eatery while in town for a wedding. Known for its cajun chicken and pizza served on crackers as opposed to dough and pasta sauce. We got the cajun strip sandwich and the original pizza. Both were very delicious!! Service was great too!! We had just returned from a hike and our server refilled our drinks at least 4 times without us asking. Seats on the patio allows you to take in the wonderful Old Town Scottsdale and warm weather.Went here after having heard repeated recommendations from friends and reading great reviews for quite some time. The place was packed and waiting time was among the longest I've had at any restaurant but the quality of the food and atmosphere (always a big thing for me), easily made up for it. We had the Barbecue Salmon with Spanish Rice and Escab√©che. 
The meal was quite pricey but that's often the case when you enjoy a few glasses of wine with your mean and that's not necessarily an issue with me as high quality restaurants like this aren't ones I visit often. Definitely recommend.Since I'm *almost* the duchess of this AJ's location (watch out Ben B), it's time for a review...

AJ's is the definition of a high-end, gourmet grocery store... As mentioned in most of the other reviews, their produce is gorgeous, their food fresh and delicious, and their staff friendly and helpful (for the most part).  This seems to be my go-to spot lately for a lunchtime sandwich or a quick snack.  

My pregnant belly has been craving the vegetarian delight sandwich quite often.  (Lettuce, tomato, cucumber, avocado, provolone and I add honey mustard).  Try it... i bet you'll like it!  My pet peeve is that sometimes it gets really crowded and the wait is pretty long.  Other times it's not crowded at all but the deli staff is not so attentive.  Just something to work on, I guess... And I don't mean to be picky, but when I request a certain kind of wrap (whole wheat for example), and I sit down to eat and see that my sandwich is on a tomato-basil or spinach wrap, I'm not the happiest camper.  **If you are going to change up my bread choice, please tell me in advance!

Aside from my minor pet peeves above and the high prices, I do love AJ's.  Their chip selection is awesome and so is their bakery and flower shop.  Oh, and don't miss their salad bar either.  Or their cheese or prepared-foods section.  (I could go on and on).  So sure, you'll spend a pretty penny if you go, but it is a pleasure to shop at this and most of the other AJ's locations.Went here today for lunch at the clubhouse and had a fantastic meal with great service. It had been over five months since my mom had been there but the waiter recognized her from afar and asked how we had been and said he was glad to see us again. Very nice and genuine guy.

I got the club sandwich which was very good (have had better but a very solid sandwich). It was really big and had enough leftover for a snack I will be looking forward to later today. 

Dad had tuna salad sandwich which was good and also big, mom had the sliders which are normally an appetizer but seemed to be perfect for someone who isn't really hungry but still is ready for lunch.

Overall, service was great, very nice dining room, not very busy, great view, and good food. Will definitely come back.Great view, really good food, nice Asian theme to the food. Good service. I would go back for sure.Almost a year to the first time we visited Razz's, we went back in company with another couple.  Stellar meal.  DH and I shared an appy of squash blossom stuffed with cheese, lobster and crab.  Absolutely delish and it was brought to our table already on separate plates, so DH and I did not have to pass the small appetizer plate back and forth for bites. Very thoughtful.  Our DC's got a spicy Indonesian noodle bowl called something like Bai Mai Goreng or something---who cares?  Our friend was kind enough to share a bite and it was outstanding.  Could easily have eaten a bowl of it as an entree.  And speaking of entrees,  And speaking of entrees---we two ladies got the duck breast  with lingonberry sauce and a  house blend farro.  Duck was cooked perfectly, just a hint of pinkness and not a bit dry an the fat beautifully rendered.  I didn't love the farro---a bit crunch for me---but my fellow duck-eater loved her's!  The gentlemen, respectively, got the chicken scalloppini and the steak special, and there were a lot of groans of delight emitting from that end of the table.  The art on the walls is remains kind of weird, but still a lovely, intimate ambiance and our service was quite good,  Razz's definitely will remain on our "re-visit" list!It was my first time here and I loved this restaurant. Beautiful grounds and we had a wonderful meal at sunset. 

The food was very good, with the truffle mac & cheese being a fave. The wine list is extensive with lots of unique choices. The staff was attentive and made good suggestions. 

Bonus: One person in our crew needed gluten free options and the kitchen gave her a ton of choices. So folks with food allergies, you can really eat here too!Amore has moved to the SW corner of Bell and McDowell Mountain Roads.  Same good food, new location.Jade Palace is one of the better chinese restaurants in a town that's shamefully devoid of such a wonderful cuisine.  I won't argue the quality of the food that's served at Jade Palace, but when it comes to american chinese, this restaurant is much more american than chinese.

The lemon chicken is a perfect example of my argument.  It's pretty good, but little about it screams chinese.  It's served as two pieces of flattened fried chicken (it looks a lot like a schnitzel) cut into long strips.  Eating this dish with a pair of chop sticks is nearly impossible.  You'll at least need to use a knife to cut it down in size.  Nitpicking aside, I love the lemon sauce which mixes well with the chicken and rice.  It's delicious.I'm new to yelp and this is my first review. I've been a member at this gym for about a year and a half now. The equipment has greatly improved since I started here. The trainers are great and the free classes I get are awesome too. I recommend Mike or Fred for training. Music is great and not too loud and the people are really friendly. Everyone is so outgoing. If im having a hard time with my workout members and trainers alike will help me out with no hesitation. I highly recommend this gym to anyone trying to build muscle or just get in shape.Gotta say, I usually only order pancakes at Denny's and they usually are solid each time. Several times though, I did order a burger in a Vegas Denny's and it was actually hand formed and that was good too. Here at 9am today and can't say anything bad. Dining companion had a big omlette that was well cooked and served with english muffin and hash browns - she said it was good. I wasn't that hungry and went with a short stack of three buttermilk pancakes with fresh sliced bannas on to for $4.50. Waiter refilled my coffee three times and was pleasant and there was also some regular's there that the servers knew by name (I hope I don't become one of them), but it was a nice touch. Menu is now huge and Grand Slam was on special for 5 bucks. Seats in the booth are well worn, so slide your butt to the end of the booth and you should be fine. Not as crowded (half full) as you would expect, but a goiod start to the day and coffee was hot and hit the spot.Yeah so I love pubs, especially ones of the British flavor, and we tried this out tonight and it was a pretty good fit for what were looking for...

Prices were reasonable, and as was the service.

I was extra stoked for River Monsters on the T.V. Quiet Riot, Radio Head, the Scorpions, and Motorhead all within a 30 minute period.  Newcastle on tap, and $2 PBR Pints means this place gets extra thumbs up from me.

Fish and Chips, Deep Fried Pickles all great English food, the whole menu looked and smelled good.

Proper Bar sized pool table looked like it was in good condition and seen some use...another good sign.

I do have two chief complaints though (otherwise this place may get five stars)....

They don't play, and didn't even know about the English Premiership league, and as such aired no football (soccer) games....How can you run an English pub without this...I don't know..... 

No taxidermy animal carcass gracing the walls.....again a classic touch that would have gone a long way in my book.

We went on a Thursday and it was pretty busy I'm sure this place get's hopping on the weekend....

A little bit hard to find and a bit of a hole in the wall, this place is for sure going on our regular list.I decided on this place as I was looking for a place to try Trivia . And found many more reasons why I had a good time. The place has great energy, very good food, great service ( even though its slow, the trivia distracts you) . The size of the helpings is generous and the prices are reasonable.  I especially recommend the bread pudding. Will have to be back to redeem the slightly poor performance in the Trivia! ;)Ordered:

Beef w/ Broccoli: 3/5 - well cooked, but a little bland. I like a bit more flavor and have beennspoiled by NYC Chinese.

Seafood Wonton/Eggdrop cross: 4/5 - burnt egg not so bueno, but other than that? Very nice. Only two shrimp and one wanton in a large one... The flavor was lovely, nice vegetable content... I can forgive the short comings.

Chicken Lo-Mein: 5/5 - Woooooooow drool!!!!

General Tso's Chicken: 4.5/5 - Very small portion for the price but Taste? 5/5. Holy wow.

Crab "Puffs"/rangoon: 3/5 - they were free because the order was over $30, but these were basically fried creamcheese no crab to be found. Can't really complain about free food though

Service: 5/5 - GREAT service! Guy was funny as Hell on the phone

Delivery: 5/5 Super super speedy!


over all? 4/5 would definitely order from again :) No witticism for take out today.We're Frank Lloyd Wright design fans... and it was very interesting... but just don't go in the summer.   There isn't any A/C in the buildings, and you wander from one to the next on a tour that feels endless while you are about to expire in the Phoenix August. 

In the cooler months, I'm sure it's awesome.The only negative aspect I can see, is the lack of close parking.

The Salmon BLT was perfect, and went perfectly with my Hefeweizen, even though the menu didn't pair the two.  I will return to indulge again.

My buddy's Chicken Beer Sandwich was a game changer due to their fresh baked beer bread, which was kind of like a soft thin focaccia.  The sandwich was served 'wrap' style.  His order came with beer battered fries, and they were great.

They only have fresh lemons to squeeze into your Hefe, so you'll have to bring your own oranges.  And remember... pulp can move, baby!I had a Scottish style brew, and got to try the Adovado and the Chicken Enchiladas.  Both were very tasty, but I really enjoyed the Adovado.  It's chicken that has been slow cooked for hours in a red chili pepper sauce.  Very good, maybe a bit rough on the digestion.  haha The beer was good, and it's obviously a popular place.  The service was attentive and friendly, and I don't recall any of us needing to ask for anything.  Definitely a good place to stop in for a beer and some food. I didn't get to try the pizzas there, but was told they are very good, as well.Gotta be the most affordable sushi happy hour prices in all of Phoenix. Really great sushi, really great service!Great Classic Burger and an old time diner feel! Can be a bit inconsistent with over cooking the patties at times, but overall great job.  Love the unique chili and egg toppings and choice of skinny or fat fries.This location is always very consistent in service and food
I think it is also one of the busier locations simply because it is basically on ASU Main Campus
Parking is usually available even on the weekends
The Southwestern Eggrolls are yumzo!
Chilis is great in changing up their menus and adding new things in a great timely manner
They also have all the classics and things that people love
I like the burgers 
The sizzlin fajitas are great too
The drinks are very good each time

The great thing about this location is that you can have dinner and once you're done with that, you can take a stroll north up Mill ave for funReally good food!  My friend and I shared an artichoke, bow tie pasta salad with other vegetables and aromatics in it, and a breast of chicken with spinach, tomatoes cooked with garlic, served over a pile of mashed potatoes.  Large portions, satisfactory service (would give it five stars if it was better), excellent baklava.  If I lived close to a Pita Jungle, I'd go back again and again.Oreganoes is fantastic, the pizza is alot better than main stream pizza and hole in the wall places.  

The wings of fire is probably the best tasting in town.  the food portions are massive and reasonably priced.

there is always a wait for lunch or dinner so its a great place to go for off hour eating.

the pizzuki is standard issue, but i'm not really a desert person so I can't say if its good or bad.Always love going here while visiting Phoenix area.  Calamari appetizer could use a little more flavor in the breading but what do you expect in Arizona ?  Other appetizers are good (breads and guac).  Salads and sandwiches are huge.  Too bad my family won't eat deep dish pizza.  It's in my blood growing up in Chicago but who can tackle a pie on their own ?  Pasta Basta with chicken is my go-to favorite.  A Greek twist on pasta.I was referred to Dr. Mendelson after dealing with chronic sinusitis and breathing problems.  After a couple appointments and a CAT scan, we determined that surgery would be the best way to fix my issues.  The surgery and post-op followups all went by without complications, and I'm now much better than I was.  

Throughout the care, the doctor let me know exactly what was and wasn't going on, discussed my options with me, and helped me make informed decisions on my care.  I'll admit that sometimes the face-time with the doctor was a little sparse, but he got the job done well and I'm quite thrilled about my rediscovered ability to breathe clearly again.

Nearly all of my appointments happened on time. The one exception was a day when he had to deal with an emergency case that set the other appointments back.  His nurses and PA are all awesome and provided excellent care.  His office staff are pretty okay - there would be times when they'd get their hands a little more full than they could handle, but I was never left hanging by them for an inappropriate amount of time.Saw Jim Breuer on the 30th of July. I haven't laughed that hard in a while. The two openers were funny as well. We were in the first row so it was even better. We arrived early but still had to wait for an hour in the heat which sucked, 105 degrees plus. Once we were finally sat the show started so we really didn't get time to enjoy the atmosphere. We ordered two drinks each and split some nachos which came out to be $54 dollars which seemed pricey. Overall we had an awesome time.BEST VEGAN COMFORT FOOD -try the sweet potato puffs

Green is a haven for vegheads who are looking for some comfort food.  With stellar sandwiches like the G-spicy po'boy and the Secret BBQ chi'kn sandwich, Green disproves the notion that vegan food is rabbit-food.  
Don't be shy here, the staff is generally very friendly and happy to suggest their favorites.  I've found that the staff is happy to oblige simple requests like more sauce and more heat.  

Yes, I've personally had every sandwich, salad, and appetizer on the menu - my favorite is the Ranchero Salad (easy on the flour tortilla strips).  ...and I'm working my way through the bowls.  

Don't miss trying the Thyme Fries or a Tsoynami.  They're great to share, especially since you also split the guilt of these treats.This is a pretty good water park, and a great substitute for the beach. The wave pool is probably the highlight for me, since it's real fun and relaxing to be carried away by the waves. However, the slides fall into two categories:
1. Anal cleansing 
2. Floatie slide
I think it's definitely worth it with the half off discount ($14 per person). Even with the discount though, we could've driven to a real beach with all the money we spent today! But, it's nice if it's a lazy summer day and you've got nothin' to do. But, I'm glad I went, it was totally worth it!Even while sitting in the VERY last row of the auditorium, I had a lovely view and could hear the performance well. (Minus poor Gaston's mic issues on opening night of Beauty and the Beast.) 

The interior and exterior are nice enough and I like the retro feel of the place. Parking is decent and leaving after the performance was pretty painless. 

Minus one star for the terrible Ladies Room situation. Why do planners over look this issue in so many public places? When a girl has to go, a girl has to go! Add more stalls, Gammage...please!We decided to give Rosita's a second chance and I'm glad we did!  

The chips and salsa are excellent here. 

I ordered the Monday night special - chicken fajitas burro and it was delicious. Much better than anything I've ever ordered in the past. It came with rice and beans that were.....fine. The rice could use some help.

One person in our party ordered the green corn tamales - she did not care for them. My husband said the fajitas beef burro was good. My daughter inhaled her kid's grande plate that was fill of mini tacos, tostada, rolled tacos, etc.  My son ordered the beef chimi. He said it was good, but soggy. 

I definitely agree with other reviewers - this place needs a major face lift and deep cleaning. The restrooms are a disaster. 

Very casual atmosphere. The service was fine, but not great.  Nothing to compliment but nothing do big as to complain.All dishes had excellent flavor and were plentiful!  Had both the beef and the chicken, couldn't say which was my favorite.  I will return.Love this place! Great food and great prices. 1/4 chicken is more than enough food for one, choose between corn or flour tortillas and I always get a side of sour cream.  Staff isn't the friendliest, but easily overlooked by the quality of food. Don't forget to bring cash.Maybe it's the midwestern in me, or maybe I'm just not very adventurous, because when it comes to middle eastern food, it don't have a clue as to what's what. But I've been to Haji Baba a couple times now and have not only found things on the menu I can identify, I found things that are really good!

1. their hummus is really good and their pitas are nice and fresh.
2. the chicken shwarma is also really good, flavorful without being weird.
3. I've never been a big falafel fan, at most places it seems really dry to me, but theirs is not dry, yet not greasy, has a good flavor and is complimented nicely with the tahini sauce.

On my last visit I ordered the falafel (three balls) and a side of rice. They gave me a huge plate of rice, more than I could eat. Between that and the falafel I was full and satisfied. 

And like everyone else says, it's cheap, which is always a bonus.I had no lunch plans and was looking for a new spot. Now I must admit that this was before I had been turned onto Yelp so I was still relying on colleague recommendations. 

Having grown up on Middle Eastern food any opportunity I get to take down an authentic Gyro I won't pass up. So my buddy Dan and I go to one of his old local favorites Haji-Baba. 

I order the Gyro and fries and was blown away. The price was cheap; the meat was well seasoned and thinly sliced. I hate it when they slice it too thick.

All in all I had a great time the only reason why it didn't get five stars is it took a while because it was slammed during lunch. But if you work anywhere near ASU in Tempe and are craving a good Gyro don't think twice...Haji Baba.Very crispy thin slices that have terrific toppings.  Yes, the pizza is pre-made and on display under glass on the counter (9-10 different varieties at lunch) but they give it a couple of minutes in the oven before they serve it to you.

The key to this place I think is to get there when they open or after they start making their dinner pizzas.  Fresh and hot is best.

I really like this place.  Its simple, good and the value is pretty decent for the size of the slice.

I really enjoy any of their pesto pizzas and greek pizzas.  Very good.The second half of date night was spent on the new huge patio at Fat Tuesday's. I didn't come here enough in college. 

It is a nice change to normal beer or vodka drinks everywhere else. I have been there several time over the past few years and they have made a lot of changes since the last time we were there. The patio is nice and huge now with TVs and an outside bar. The drinks are always good, and they came up with a bunch of new concoctions. I had the Fruit Cocktail one, super good. It was a mix of the Pina Colada, Strawberry, Melon and Octane, it was like a new flavor in every sip. 

The staff is friendly and not too chatty, but just enough.

We will for sure be back.Was back today for dinner, and again it was a great experience. In my last review my only complaint was the vegetable portion, which this time was decidedly larger. I've never had a bad experience and I don't anticipate ever having one here.Pretty good burger for a good price and quick for lunch. Nice to sit outside and people watch tooMy wife and I recently purchased a Passat. Our salesperson was Ryan. I must say, it was a very low-pressure environment. The transaction went smoothly, and Ryan answered and addressed every concern we had. We are very happy with our vehicle purchase. The only reason I didn't give LeSueur 5 stars was because I still believe our trade-in was worth more than what we were offered. However, the difference wasn't so much that it was a "deal-breaker." Well-done, LeSueur!Came here on a Sunday late afternoon and enjoyed a nice, quiet, and leisurely meal as only one of three tables there.  

For starters, we ordered the fried sweet potatoes. They came with fish sauce for dipping and were pretty tasty. For our entrees, my friend ordered the Red Curry at a 5 spice level! (that's the hottest they offer!) and it was REALLY spicy. one tiny spoonful and my mouth was burning and I was gulping down water. For myself I ordered the Pad See Eiw at a 3 spice (which was much more pleasant, for me at least).  I liked my dish a lot.  It was a little heavy on noodles and a little light on veggies, but I would definitely order it again.  For dessert we ordered the purple sticky rice with mango - so pretty and tasty too!  I can never turn down sticky rice.  Wish I had some right now....

Service was great and friendly.  Our server offered lots of refills on water and checked to make sure we liked all our dishes.

All in all, a nice experience, and I will be back some time soon!yo, bro, let's compare forearm tats and drink some New Castle. P.S. everyone saw you bif it on your fixie as you rolled up to the bike racks.

for real, most predictable crowd ever!!!!

I can talk mad shit on this place all night long, but when it comes down to it, I love it. The location lends to its patrons- alternative college students living in the only historic (PHX like) neighborhood in Tempe. Plus it is right next to HTC, so everyone is sure to be rocking the flyest of  -50 gauges. puke.

but.......the charm of casey's is in the cats. they are cool and roam around. Also, the best patio ever, and lots of room. Don't go inside unless you can't get a drink b/ your waitress forgot about you (which is most likely what happened). Or if you like old dudes 65+ eyefucking the shit outta you be my guest. Also, one night after I was there, the next morning someone had charged $2000+ on my credit card for an ad in New Times. shady......or recession? I think I know how this happened, they leave your card within an arms reach from the bar inside, face-up so any creeper with 20/20 can get a peek and thief you out of your identity and money, or maybe it was an inside job???

but I really like this place and still have "casey's nights" even though jimmy eat world sucks and I live in phoenix. 

oh yeah, this place is haunted too....and if you are a girl do not go pee in the grotto.gross.Good beer, decent food- but thats not why you go, close to campus, and a great way to end the day. Definitely enjoyed a happy hour or two especially after a long day or week of school.  Its really nice to sit outside and just hang out or people watch. Casey's certainly can attract an interesting bunch. All in all a solid place to drink and hang out.Oh ACK someone elses totally incorrect assessment of the situation prompted me to write a second review as a retort. 

This place is totally dis-similar from Filbertos. 

PERIOD.I used to joke about this place because of past experiences with restaurants that do many different asian dishes at once. Usually they're  so terrible with food that it'll knock you on your back faster than a kick to the face.

Tott's proved me wrong. So wrong that I came back the day after I ate there. Everything i've had has been really good, but I have an addiction to their orange shrimp. The perfect level of spice, the crunchy golden shrimp, and that godly sauce...sorry. I need to clean up my keyboard now. The walnut shrimp was really good, the bourbon chicken was nice, the stir fry is good, and the lo mein was excellent.

Wait. All this praise and it's only getting 4 out of 5? Okay, their fried rice isn't all that great (tastes pretty flat) and the won ton soup has some pretty weak won tons. 

The portions are huge though and it compensates for the flat rice. If their fried rice was as good as any other chinese place, i'll happily edit this and give them five stars. The owner is really nice though and is always thankful for your business...so my final score is a 4 1/2 out of 5.The Gyro combo is fantasticBeing from the midwest, I'd been looking for a place that served Chicago-style deep dish pizza and Yelp helped me locate this place (which just happened to only be about 2 miles from where I live). Vito's was really good! As it was just me, I had lots of leftovers and they reheated well in the microwave and I think may have even tasted better the 2nd day. Don't let the location scare you away, give it a try.I love Kiss the Cook. I don't know if it's the sweet childhood memories of Sunday breakfast with my grandparents after church, its country chic charm, or its old school location near Downtown Glendale, but I just love it. 

I've been here countless times and it's always a pleasure. The food is good for what it is, and cheap to boot. I think the last time we had breakfast here our tab was a whopping $13 (excluding tip). And we ordered a ton of food (the hubs had to order a million sides to get what he wanted). The biscuits and gravy is always delicious and served piping hot (the only way to eat it). Everything else is pretty standard breakfast fare, and the basket of mini muffins is always a delight. Lunch is good, too. 

If you're in the area, or looking for a unique experience, definitely visit Kiss the Cook. Then head over to Downtown Glendale for some antique and boutique shopping and old town sightseeing.Best hot sauce I've in the west valley!!

Atmosphere: it was pretty warm in there! And not the best atmosphere..bathrooms weren't very clean! 

Service: had a very sweet waitress, knew the menu very well.

Food: was very good I had the steak capato! One of my favs! 

We will be going back!The family and I decided to give the Friday Night Fish Fry a try. I don't regret it... It was good. The service was a tad on the slow side but they were pretty busy. I'd like to see what they have to offer for breakfasts now...Love the food, staff and ambiance of the place.  I have been eating there for 4 years and just love it.  My favorite dish is the 2 fish tacos with black beans.  They also have great wines at good prices.We've been ordering either take-out or delivery from here once every month or two for the past 9 years. We like Chinese every few weeks so we've tried many of the other restaurants in the area. Even so, we always find ourselves coming back to Chen & Wok over and over again.

I even went so far as to take one of their menus and check off items I had previously ordered, then ordered something new and different, and wrote a little review for myself for each item. I have eaten probably 95% of their entree's and found that the ones I didn't like were personal preference and not because of the quality.

As I said, we find ourselves gravitating back to this restaurant time and time again. That should say it all.

I give it 4 stars instead of 5 because I rarely give 5 stars.What a great discovery for local Henderson as they are located at the south end of Water Street! Great ambiance, good service and food of ample portions to share.Great office, went in on time, hygienist was professional, careful and explained everything. Dr. Song was fantastic.  Staff was courteous and pleasant.  thought the registration using a pad was ok, sometimes hard to negotiate and it would be difficult  for some.  Suggest a stylus to help.LOVE me some SONIC! 

I was raised in New Mexico and Sonic is a staple there . Sonic is on the main street and EVERYONE goes to Sonic and hangs out. 

Here in Nevada ... well especially in Henderson you can usually see some classic car clubs that come and hang out.

Reminiscent of the 50's drive in that you see in movies . 

You sit at the order box - order - and a girl or guy on skates brings you your order. 

(is it wrong you look to see if they are gonna fall?)

Last night I was out late and didn't get to eat until late ... did I mention sonic stays open to midnite and later? 

I ordered  a Sonic Cheeseburger with mustard. A perfect tasty old fashioned hamburger -and a Dr. Pepper.  

Naughty confession :  If I am wanting a soda? I will drive out of my way for a soda at Sonic - the crushed ice makes it perfect everytime.  

They also have slushies - sundaes - salads- and many other appetizing foods. 

Just writing this I think I may have to go after work and hook me up with something Today!Confirmed that they do not take coupons from http://www.restaurant.com anymore. 

Very friendly people, though!Airport with slot machines.  Very nice ;-)  Another nice thing about this place is that they have many restaurants that are open at odd hours, which I always enjoy, because when you are waiting for a flight at odd hours and you are hungry, which are all things that are common in Vegas, as we tend to be up all night, or come here for a weekend, and need to head back late or early the next morning, and we have been out all night gambling and perhaps drinking ;0), we rarely have time to eat, so that is a great addition to this place.Everything in this airport is well labeled and easy to find. We had no problems with security and in this day and age that is a good day.  Luggage pick up was a piece of cake.  They have a shuttle for everything and they all run smoothly.  I know I've flown in and out of Vegas numerous times, but man this is one of the smoothest airports I have ever experienced.  I also love how they are like 2 miles from the strip so as soon as you land you are on the strip ready to party.We have one of the easiest airports around- and trust me, I have been to many. The new terminal is really nice and spacious. I am having a hard time understanding why they have you go to Terminal 3 to check in, only to take the tram back to terminal 1 for the D and C gates. This makes no sense and wastes a lot of time. Ha- maybe it is so they can make more money on parking.Las Vegas is definitely one of my favorite cities to be in because of the amazing memories, days and nights of debauchery, gambling, and always having a good time.  It's also great that the airport is organized, easy to navigate around and has an efficient taxi line system.  There's also a lot of cafes, dining choices, and convenience stores located throughout the terminals.

There's several baggage claims but luggage comes out pretty quick and effective.  There's a lot of kiosks located outside of check-in areas to print out your ticket instead of having to talk to a guest attendant.

This airport is amazing!  You get to see everybody arriving super excited to get onto to strip, and everybody leaving hurting and tired from the festivities of their trip.2 free check in bags! Yes!!!Since moving into Soho lofts, I've been eyeing this place. I've walked by frequently and kept telling myself I needed to check it out. Well finally went tonight. 

If your a fan of old school dining and like the ambience of a cozy, little restuarant then this is the place for you. 

Upon arrival the entire restuarant was packed. The place smelled delicious and the people that did have food at their tables looked like they were enthusiastically enjoying it. I was ushered to a small table in the back by the fireplace. The mood of the place was happy and satisfied. The waiters were hurrying along taking orders, refilling drinks, and delivering food. Everything on the menu looked great. I'm a stickler for traditional food so I ordered the spagetti and meatballs. It came out about 20 minutes after I ordered it. Steaming hot and huge portions. The garlic bread was buttery and crisp and had filled me up quite a bit. So I was already pretty full by the time my good arrives. But needless to say it was so good that I managed to make room for my fantastic entr√©e. My son who's a picky eater was gobbling it up as fast as I would feed him lol. I was most definitely be coming here again in the near future. I'd highly recommend eating here.Classic New Mexico roadside comfort food at it's purest. Open the door, step back in time, and enjoy a slice of New Mexican pride. Pork chile verde and beef chile Colorado rock the house. Wet slow simmered pork burritos with that green chile sauce is full of love. The sopapillas are hard to beat. I wish my mother would have washed my mouth out with these sopapillas instead of plain soap. The 2 dishes of tableside salsa are vastly different from each other and both delish. One looks pretty tomato saucy, but don't judge that book by it's cover-it's bursting with flavor. I have seen orders of nachos (which I rarely order) that look amazing...but have not tried them. Nothing else like it in Vegas.This place was grrreat!!! The rooms were clean and the food was cheap... and I don't care what anyone says, all the native Hawaiians are cool. All the table games were cheap enough for a weekend but they still took most of my "designated" gambling cash. The only problem I have with this review is not the hotel, but the area. The whole Fremont experience blows ass. The street was covered with trailer park, white trash, thuggish ruggish, drunk-out-of-their-mind, slutty, scum-baggy people. Luckily I didn't see any of those peeps in the California. The rooms were the best part but why didn't I give the full five stars?.. we paid $14.99 to watch "Role Models"... they saw us coming....!!!.. hahaaaLove the wings and fries! Sometimes it can get loud in there with all the drunks, but the service is always good!Room was part of a deal with SW Air so I am unsure of the true cost per-night. If deducting the cost of air alone is any indicator, it was a great value. 
One major problem I discovered upon entering the room: no a/c and the room was near 80. This was in the middle of January and the whole hotel tower was on winter mode. So you may ask, why do I need a/c.? I am not entirely sure of this myself, but could be due in part to the room facing due-south and the window not opening sufficiently to allow the room to cool. I left the room for about 9 hours, and still it was 75. Not comfortable for me. Let the desk know, and they complementary upgraded me to a huge suite in the newer hotel tower (which has a/c & heat at all times). I didn't have to throw a fit, they just offered. Very clean rooms. Great location off the strip. Furniture and decor are an odd mishmash but clean and quality. New TV. 

Pro: free parking. value. location. olde-vegas charm and grit
Con: very smoky casino. no shuttle to airport. not on monorail. no pool or spa. WiFi is $8/day!Came in to the casino on a recent trip, and the staff was incredibly nice.  They explained the players club card, and gave plenty of free play as I had never been here before.  The casino was very smoky, but what do you expect out of a locals joint?  The single deck blackjack was awesome, the dealers were very friendly, and so was the pit crew.  I had heard stories of people getting backed off when changing their bets, but I ran a positive progression, and had no problems from them at all.  Ended up leaving up about 100 bucks with the blackjack and the video poker, so all in all, a great trip, and will probably stay here next time I'm in Vegas!This my third time staying here with my girlfriend and we really like the Golden Nugget. Most recently, we stayed three nights at the newly opened Rush Tower. The staff was pleasant and friendly. The room at the Rush Tower on the 21st floor offered a nice view of the Strip. The bathroom was huge with large sliding doors which divided the bathroom from the hallway. The Golden Nugget buffet was great, offered many selections and everything was fresh and served hot. I would recommend the Nugget to anyone looking to stay downtown. The Golden Nugget  reminds me of the old days in Vegas when Sinatra and the Rat Pack stayed and played. It has a lot of "old school" charm and elegance which seems to be missing from the newer and larger casinos on the Strip.When I think of Las Vegas, I think of the strip... and I think of fun.  I've had my fair share of trips to the LV strip hotels.  I've stayed at TI, Caesar's Palace, Mandalay Bay, Bellagio, and Venetian.  And I have no complaints about any of them.  But last week, I saw a new side of Las Vegas... 

I stayed at the Golden Nugget, and this place blew my expectations away!  I may even have a new favorite place to stay in Las Vegas from now on... from the bell men and reception to the maids, everyone was friendly at this place.  And the accommodations were awesome.  I had a huge room in the Gold Tower.  For $89 per night, I was a VIP.  Unlimited bottles of water were stocked on my floor, apples throughout the day, snacks in the afternoon, coffee in the morning.  An extremely comfortable bed, nice amenities in the bathroom, and access to the fitness room was included in that rate.

The only things that I missed were easy access to a diet coke (no mini bar in the room or vending machine on the floor), and one of the days, I was missing shampoo.  

If you stay at the Nugget, go for the Gold (or the new Rush Tower I gather in reading the other reviews).  I was in town for a quick yelpy work visit, so I didn't get a chance to explore the shark pool or casino, but there is always next time.  And there will be a next time, Golden Nugget, and hopefully real soon!We stayed in the Carson tower! Room was perfect, no complaints, very quiet on the 19th floor. The aquarium/pool was awesome! Honestly, had a great experience here and what a nice hotel for being down town!I wanted to make this my last stop yesterday before I left Vegas. I loved the TV show and have always wanted to see whats inside. I went not expecting to see anyone from the TV show and I was right. The girl at the counter was telling everyone they had just left on spring break for 2 weeks and would be back after that. 

The shop is a lot smaller in person so that was slightly disappointing. Also most items where not for sale in the back. You will still see quite a few items in the show, Lots of souvenirs from the show that could be picked up at a reasonable price.Best bang for your buck Buffet and delicious too. I take all my friends there and they agree it was the best buffet to start the Vegas experience.My awesome girlfriend found this tour. I had heard about this place and even seen it in a few movies and TV shows but I didn't know regular people could take tours. About a year ago they installed LED lights so they could do night tours. It was really cool.
If you do a night tour during the colder months don't forget a jacket. It gets cold out there.
It was very interesting. Not just seeing the signs but all of the history behind them. There were not too many people on our tour on a Saturday night but there were more people at the museum then I expected there to be. It is nice to know that people know about this place and that they are doing ok.
The main lobby is the lobby of an old hotel. The people who owned the hotel didn't just want to tear it down when it went out of business so they gave it to the museum and the moved it down to their location. It is very nice. Retro but not run down and dirty. They have different gifts items on sale and displayed around the lobby. Plus these two motion activated screens that when you stood in front of and moved your hand over the different categories on screen it gave you little snippets of history about Vegas.
I guess the history of the town is one thing you don't really think about when you come here. Plus it seems like the town is pretty good about getting rid of it's old historic places for the new and improved. It is all about the latest and greatest. Got to keep people coming back and spending money. History be damned.
I didn't know it cost about $10,000 to restore just a small sign. So it is no wonder most of them are not lit up but the LED lights do a good job of lighting them up enough so you can see them. These are huge signs meant to be able to be seen from even far away. So I think even if they were all restored and lit up like they were originally you would go blind walking around right in front of them. They do have a few of them restored and lit up but most of them that they restore they put back out in street for the public to enjoy.
This is a cool tour. I would recommend it to others for sure. I especially like all of the history behind the signs. It is a different thing to do in Vegas.This is pretty much the best dim sum you can get Las Vegas. I frequent here with my family and service is usually good. They have a wide variety of dim sum foods to choose from but they also have congee, you tiao, and sometimes even a small portion of fried noodles and what not. Price is also very cheap and a good atmosphere. Come early on weekends to prevent waiting in line!Used to head out to the old Flamingo location a few times a year but with the new location accross from the HRH I frequent about once a month - usually for lunch.  One of my favorites for taking clients as the pace of service, food quality, menu selection, and portions are just right for a business lunch...Nothing particular stands out on the menu as "must have" but teh osso buco and pastas are all winners and have had a few very good fish dishes...its on my list of regular places to go.Today was only the second time we've dined with Ferraro's, however, it was just as pleasant as the first experience! The space is nice and intimate and the service is wonderful. Fabulous staff.

During the previous summer, Ruben and I dined with one of our best friends, Randy. We were delighted to discover that they were offering locals 50% off the bill! Whoa right? So we took full advantage of it and did a full Italian dinner! ANTIPASTI: Calamari Fritti and Salsiccia Calabrese e Rapini (housemade spicy sausage grilled with polenta triangles). PASTA sampler course: Gnocchi with Boar Ragu, Lobster Truffle Ravioli, and Agnolotti (ravioli filled with spinach, mascarpone, ricotta, mortadella, tear-drop tomato sauce). I SECONDI: Osso Bucco, Fettuccine Pomodoro Con Ricotta Fresca, and Agnolotti (Ruben liked it so much, he ordered it for his entr√©e!). DESSERT: Pistachio Passion (layered pistachio cream, cream cheese custard & whipped cream atop a rich walnut crust) and Tiramisu. Everything was phenomenal. We all ordered drinks as well and the bill was around $150. Amazing.

Today, we visited for lunch and had to get the Calamari Fritti again. Very nice. Light breading, large, fresh prices of calamari, and delicious, spicy marinara. It definitely outshined the Calamari we had just two days ago! I opted for the Spaghetti Vongole e Pomodorini (housemade spaghetti with clams, olive oil, garlic & cherry tomatoes) and Ruben had the Penne Pesto e Pollo (penne with a light basil sauce topped with chicken breast). Both were really wonderful and the pasta was seriously good (also, cooked perfectly al dente)! I also don't remember the bread tasting so good last time! They were little baguettes with an oil dipping sauce and I couldn't get enough.

Great Italian food, decent prices, and wonderful experiences. Yes!This is one of my favorite local places to go and eat lunch with my friends and family.  food has always been really good. The service is the only reason I am giving it 4 stars. The service has always been either really good or well, not so good sometimes. The free yelp offer was good. They bring u a very decent Pinot Grigio for the wine. Our server was not bad. He could have been a little more attentive to us tho. Sometimes it seemed he would kind of disappear and I had to go find him twice. Overall a very good restaurant. I would come back here.My GF loved this restaurant growing up on the west coast. When she discovered this location she begged/demanded that we give this place a try. 

Servings are huge! The GF had a chef salad that could have easily served and filled up a family of four. The ingredients were fresh and had great flavor. Only. Complaint was that they didn't have regular ranch and she had to settle for their Bacon Ranch (there was none of it left to take home with her leftovers so it really wasn't a complaint with merit)

 The daughter had fish and chips, another huge portion good fish flavor but the fries were soggy. They might need a different routine (not leaving them hang over the frier etc to keep them crisp).

I had the Ravioli it was a huge portion I took half home with me as I also had the BlackBerry Cobbler. The Cobbler was amazing definitely worth stopping in for all by itself. 

The Ravioli wasn't bad but definitely not the best thing on their menu. It looked odd/out of place on the menu amongst all the country dishes and I just had to give it a try.

The Ravioli had a strong vinegar taste that I didn't care a whole lot for. The sauce outside of the vinegar was good and the pasta/meat was almost perfect.

The service was top notch quick to refill drinks. Quick to bring out extra dressing for the salads. Always with a smile and a country flare. 

I'm a fan and will be happy to return.Nice rooms and huge casino. Pool is nice and same with the arcade for kids.  Great food.  I would recommend both the buffets, just be ready to wait in line unless you're platinum or above in they player's club.I like that during the week it is free for locals! Also you can bring your kids there is a pool with a sandy area which is great for all ages and if your kids are in the teens you can let them hangout it the under 21 area... and you can go to the adult pool which is only open on weekends. They have a dj but it's just okay.. I think that pool used to be the sapphire pool. Also there drinks are kind of boring they need a menu redo.Very tasty rolls! I sat at the sushi bar and got quick fast service. Fresh good and good wine selection. Hotel even occationally offers coupons for folks staying here.They have really cheap clothes, but quality would be pretty bottom-level. Though, one of my favorite pair of shorts is from here. And it's pretty good. I've actually washed a hand-wash only shirt and that basically went bye-bye. Watch out for the labels to make sure it's not hand-wash only and if it, don't machine wash it!

It might be on the same price level as Wet Seal, but I do adore their style of clothes. Love them. They have their store divided into sections depending on the color so it's pretty neat.

Don't expect any extraordinary service or even a smiley "hi, how are you?" kind of thing. If you need some quick party clothes, this would be great to go to.

PS. They changed their name to Rhapsodielle.Have eaten at many Andre Rochat restaurants, my favorite was the downtown location near the Federal courthouse, which is now closed.

Alize has a very nice design/interiors, takes good advantage of views.  Has a great corner table on the SE corner, where I sat next to my spouse in a booth and we had a full panoramic view to the east of the Strip - very nice.

Service was very good, only mistep was we requested to see the price fixe menu (we like to see these, although we do not always order off of them if they do not offer things we like), and waiter strongly dissuaded us for ordering off the menu - suggested it was much lower quality than the main menu (which is generally not the case in my experience - most fine restaurants offer price fixe as limited options of similar quality - they will not serve food that tarnishes the perception of their fine restaurants).  I sensed the upsell here more than a recommendation fully in the customer's interests.

Would up ordering one price fixe menu item and a series of a la carte items, both were very good - high quality, creative, well prepared/presented.  Rocket salad, french onion soup, ribeye with bean ragout, other items were very good.

One can easily spend $150-$300 per person here with food and wine, so be prepared, as this is a fine dining experience.

Recommended.Every time I'm in Vegas, I hit this place. I was just there last weekend but was so preoccupied eating I forgot to check in! Lame me.

So I see there are some people who are saying it's overpriced. I won't lie, over the past 5-7 years, the portion sizes have indeed gone down, and in some respects, yes, the creativity. However, the QUALITY of the food has not gone down in MOST cases, though yes, I do see them making more mistakes in that regard over time. Also, the quality of staff service is becoming more inconsistent, which given the price tag I don't think you can allow. To wit:

SERVICE

Waitstaff was not on point on our visit, where we blew over $1K on multiple tasting menus, two bottles of pricy wine, and add-ons. They were a B+, which, for that kind of money, is not acceptable. 

The very first time I went to Alize, years ago, they were so impeccable with their timing of presentation, no mistakes made, no details missed, every time you moved there was someone suddenly standing there ready to attend you, or adjusting something for you, catching all the little details. For example, at this level of restaurant, you shouldn't even have to move your own glasses, for the prices they are charging you. If your glasses are in their way trying to present a plate to you, your main waiter presents and another guy comes under him to adjust what he needs to and make way. On this trip, I kept moving stuff around for my WAITER. I am not eating at Chevy's people, this is a starred meal, what is going on? 

Don't get me wrong, I come from a working class family. I am more than happy to move stuff around for people if I'm at Chevy's. But when I pay you this kind money, I expect you to meet that. 

Also wait staff switched two people's appetizers, one of whom was eating the tasting menu, another of whom had ordered a la carte. One waiter gave one friend at the table an elaborate presentation of her dessert (he presented, cut into her desert, elaborately poured on a sauce)  then left the table to go somewhere else. Two other people who got the same dessert were just handed the dessert as is, then forgotten. Someone had to flag another waiter to ask them to come back with the sauce, which we then got to pour on ourselves. We had multiple conversations with at least two wait staff serving our table who were not up to par with the rest of the staff (confused, missing things, forgetting things, rushing around stressed out) and you can see things slipping here.

Aside from that, though, the staff was nice and friendly and personable. They were definitely well meaning, they just weren't on the ball.

WINE

The sommelier saw me eyeing the wine list and early on Sat nite was eager to help out. Picked a great wine. I let him go slightly over budget. It was delicious and worth it. As mentioned by others, your beverage list is on an ipad which definitely makes it neat and fun and easy to evaluate your drink options. Sommelier was friendly and felt a bit like a dapper gentleman with a sparkle in his eye.

FOOD

The whole show so far would have been a 3. The food won me back to a 4. It wasn't perfect, but it was enough.

- Seared foie gras. Someone else says you can't mess up foie gras. Um, ignore him. I have had all kinds, all over the world, and will tell you that THIS foie? Orgasmic. It is a hint on the too sweet side, but is still amazing. If you could have "lean" foie gras that won't make you gag on its richness, that's what this was. The puree beneath it, paired with the Saturne? Blew my mind.

- Carpaccio : This was my all time favorite dish the very first time I came to Alize. This was what made me keep coming back, to find it again. But after that first time, they never made it the same way. The dish gets more and more mediocre. The first time it came on a giant platter with different dips and sauces and crackers. Each time I've had it, there's less to accompany and the meat tastes tender, but not as flavorful as the last time.

- Shrimp and scallop dish. My friend loved her scallops, I tried it, was great. The shrimp however, were mediocre.

- Dover sole: Signature dish. Very very good, I am very glad I had this in the tasting menu otherwise I would have felt only the foie gras were worth my time and been angry. Sweet with a hint of tartness, bright and smooth and rich.

- I had a rare something, filet mignon maybe it was tender and good, but red meet is not my thing.

- I had some pork loin on the tasting menu, I ate it, and don't remember it. It was passable.

- The amuse bouche the first trip to Alize blew my mind - this time, along with the palate cleanser , everything's forgettable.

- Souffle - great texture. Not amazing. I would have preferred to switch to another dessert but didn't bother asking. I ordered the butterscotch. Kind of meh. Unless you love that flavor I recommend you do another flavor.

-  As mentioned, wines were great. I ordered one cocktail and it was foul, barely touched it. It was citrus based.Only went there after seeing it on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives, must admit Guy Fieri was right, the Stromboli was great. Even though the appearance wasn't what I'd imagined the food our party of four had was good all around. Our waitress was also a kick in the pants.First off, the waiter we had was hands down one of the best servers I've ever had! We were seated fairly quickly and the food was good, pretty much on par with your average Red Lobster. The restaraunt could have been a little cleaner, which is why it gets 4 stars instead of 5.The key here is you get what you pay for. It isn't the nicest hotel on the strip nor is it the worst hotel on the strip. The rates are reasonable and you do get a comfy room, clean bathroom, and working HVAC, you just need to be patient with it. 

The checkin/checkout process was a breeze, and late checkout (extend it from 11AM to 3PM for $25 wasn't bad either). 

The only downside is that you do have to walk through the casino to get to the elevators and all those people who try to sell you show tickets. My advice, pretend not to speak English and keep walking past them. It worked for me. 

However the location wasn't bad, there was a tramway that took you to Luxor or Mandalay Bay for free, or you can take the many sky bridges to get around to other hotels. I'd stay here again if I were to return, honestly, most of the day/night you spend outside anyway so I'm not sure why some people make such a big deal about little things.I have stayed at the Excalibur 4 times, the most recent this past weekend. I was in town to see Michael Bubl√©, not really a Vegas person and don't even gamble to speak of, but go up once in awhile for a concert and have stayed at New York, Luxor, Monte Carlo and several others. I like the Excalibur for two reasons: Price and location, location, location! My room was in Tower 1 and it looked and smelled fresh. I didn't encounter any rude staff or see dirt anywhere and last I checked I am not deaf, blind or stupid. I had a great view and my only negative is no wi fi in the rooms at this hotel, just in the public areas. Crazy! But hells bells, it was cheap! You can spend the money you save elsewhere! I am just not that impressed with big fat casinos all trying to out lavish each other. I like old, classic hotels and Excalibur is kind of generic, but you aren't going to find old, classic digs in Vegas, it!s all about the glitz. It is nice to waltz through some of the fancy casinos just like the rest of the peasants but not be stuck with a huge bill so yay for me and yay for Excalibur! 3 stars for my room and an extra star for the hotel's great location. BTW, another reviewer complained about a rude waitress, if you visit Dick's Last Resort you had better do some research, the wait staff is supposed to insult you. I first heard about Dick's in Chicago and the word on the street is you should be insulted if they don't insult you. In closing, I am sorry for those who had a bad experience at the Excalibur, but also baffled. Maybe parallel universes are real. That's all I got.I was actually surprised how much I liked staying at this place despite the negative reviews. I've stayed at multiple places on the strip and ONE this place doesn't actually smell like cigarettes and old people the second you walk in, giant plus. The check in can be a little long, but just apply for an Mlife card and you get VIP check in (you can apply online or in the casinos). This is one of the more kid-friendly hotels on the strip with the whole "castle" appeal and an arcade downstairs called the "Fun Dungeon". We spent some time gambling for free drinks then going downstairs to play DDR and Air Hockey, like all the cool 20-something-year-olds do. Hahaha 
The pricing is really great too. We paid 63 dollars (not including resort fees) for a 2 queen bedroom with a great view of the Luxor and Mandalay Bay. Tower two is a bit nicer, just because it's the newer tower of them all. They do offer smoking and none smoking rooms. 
Parking here can either be Valet or self parking, I felt the parking lot was safe enough to stay in, and it was free too!
You do have the ability to ride the free tram to get to either one of those hotels quickly, or there is a quick walkway to get on the strip.
I love that this place has Dicks last resort... A hilarious restaurant to check out if you've never been to one, you have to take everything they say with a grain of salt, but they do have a great happy hour!
I'll definitely be staying here again, had a great time.For a night on the town in Vegas, we opted for an off the strip Old Vegas style restaurant. My brother raved about this place and told us of the great food and Old Vegas charm. 

Our reservation was at 8pm and before we were seated we headed for the bar. The bar was a separate room and there was a piano and a lounge singer on the corner which reminded me of Frank Sinatra. He sang the classics: Fly me to the Moon, Luck Be a Lady...I was transported in another time, a glimpse of that Old Vegas that is now hard to find amongst the new glitz and glitter that Vegas has now become. 

The cocktails at the bar was served stiff but expect steep prices...my hubby's kettle and soda was $12 and my wine was $15. 

The servers, hostess and lounge singer all seemed like a character from an old movie...they were older, very proper, but with an Italian flair so much like those I would see in Sopranos, minus the gangster attitude.

Our waiter who greeted us was very friendly and told us about the specials. He mesmerized my group with his explanation of the food. he had a great italian 'soprano" accent and a pompador hair which he kept in character the whole time. 

I ordered the Osso Bucco, a special of Pieros and a dish I have never had and most of my friends ordered veal. It seems veal is the way to go here, as the menu is full of veal. 

All I can say is everyone in our table ooh'd and aah'd over the food. My osso bucco was cooked for 4-6 hrs with the bone intact and my waiter stuck a little fork in the bone as I realized Im to eat the bone marrow! Cool I never had that before. The veal is tender, flavorful, and the bone marrow is unforgettable. My hubby's veal with quartered mushrooms, capers and wine butter sauce was also amazing. I couldn't help but be greedy as I ate from his plate too. 

This place is an experience in its own...receiving many accolades and culinary awards. its not the glitzy in-your-face-Vegas so don't expect a contemporary and ultra modern space. It is fine dining but it is unpretentious, has a dated feel with an old vegas charm. I loved the food here and I am planning to come back and have another chance at the menu.Loved this place. I was in Vegas for fourth of July weekend and the line was taking way too long. At first I was annoyed, but then when it was my turn , the girl that helped me was very helpful and let me try a sample of one of her favorite mixture of their frozen beverages. It was the ammeretto pineapple with peach. $8.00 for a big size that got be buzzin' for half the day! Worth it to me!I think I've found a place unique to Vegas -- don't know how true this statement is but it didn't have that chain feel to it.

Located in a strip mall five minutes away from Las Vegas Blvd. (aka The Strip) is this spot that serves some really tasty tapas and refreshing drinks.  The one thing I will mention about the tapas: seafood dishes are good.
Firefly is loud, crowded, and totally fun.  You got folks getting off of work and looking to unwind and chill, groups celebrating b-days, couples enjoying the setting, and a crowded bar with people waiting for the next open table.

The staff is fairly friendly and very accommodating.  They were especially cool about my request for pitchers of caparinias instead of glasses.

The only thing is parking can be sparse since Firefly shares its parking lot with Ruth Chris's -- so be prepared to search.

Overall, local or not, you should give Firefly a try.Mac and cheese is very good. Paella was a bit lacking. Firefly Fries were pretty delicious too. Roasted potatoes were a bit raw for my liking. Sweet n spicy shrimp tasted Chinese. 

I am aware that Rachael Ray has visited here, but despite that fact, the food was actually good. Ill return for mac and cheese from here ANYDAY.Firefly was very good and some dishes were great.   A fun dining experience off the Strip. 

Ambiance - 4 stars
Hipster.  But, very noisy and ice-cold AC inside.  So, we opted to sit outside, which was fine at 10pm 

Service - 3 stars
The server was very timely initially, but then they seemed to forget about us as the meal progressed.

Drinks - 2 stars
The Mojito & Margaritas were far too sweet and took forever to arrive.

Food - 
Menu Variety - 5 stars
Amazing choices (perhaps too many!)  ;-)

Stuffed dates - 5 stars
"Dance Party" in your mouth with bacon-wrapped, smoked almond, red wine reduction, blue cheese.  Amazing!

Ham & Cheese Croquetas - 3 stars
While good (and recommended by the server), it was just too rich & creamy to fully appreciate the Serrano Ham & Manchego Cheese

Steak & Mushroom Skewers - 4 stars
Grilled filet, roast garlic cream & red wine reduction.  There was quite a lot of meat, which was tender & tasty.  The sauce, while good, was a bit bland.

Beet Salad - 3 stars
It had all the proper components, beets, tender greens, nuts & feta cheese.  But, it was also somewhat bland.

Overall, Firefly was good and we might try it again with another group of friends.You know I do love tapas. Ever since Cha Cha Cha in SF, I've been crazy for tapas. After the many good reviews from Firefly, I came here with two friends to try it out. We wanted to order everything but tried to limit it to what we could eat. So we ordered:

Lobster Escargot. A little on the mushy side. Portion is small. I'm warning you now so that you don't have a shock face like I did when I saw it. There's about five pieces. Good start to the food though.

Filet Mignon Sliders. This was good. The filet mignon was cooked perfectly. Slight pink on the inside and juicy. There was also crispy onions on the side and along with two sliders. The aioli in the slider was a definite ingredient that separated Firefly's sliders from other places. 

Stuffed Mushroom. Chicken was a bit dry but I like mushrooms so I'm getting it anyways. Came in four pieces.

Camarones Al Ajillo. About 6 medium sized shrimps and one hell of an amazing sauce. The shrimps were not mushy. The sauce went perfect with the bread given. Got to impress me with sauce when I go to tapas eateries.

Along with our $30 pitcher of watermelon mojito which had Bacardi rum in it yet did not taste as strong as I thought it would, My friends and I were still a bit hungry. So we went and order the Paella. Not the best I've had. The rice a bit overcooked but the ingredients in here is absolutely worth your money. The seafood were plentiful and more than the average selection at other restaurants. 

Our total bill was about $90. We were full after for our party of 3. The restaurant is not too big and it's off the strip of Las Vegas. However, very much worth coming. Service was attentive, had no problem with it. It's located in a plaza so there is also lots of parking.Ive dined here on several occasions. For an upscale establishment, it is perfect for every occasion. I have enjoyed many of the menu items including an arugula salad, pizza, and an exceptionally cooked duck.Good mix of flavors but I would avoid the calamari. We sat in the cafe side -- check the menu to see what you would like to eat as they have a dining room side which offers a different menu.An extra star for letting allowing us to sit in close proximity  to the bar with my 2.5 year old and getting the happy hour rate for apps. Score! I was at the venetian for a conference and decided to meet up with some peers for a post conference drink and pre-dinner nosh. Try the horchata margeritia it was  a party in your mouth. Service was prompt,friendly and helpful. LIke many people stated the cerviche was fresh and clean.Great food and service.   The flautas were amazing.We were looking for a reception site for our wedding that was laid back and would give us more time to actually mingle with our guests.  We decided on Bahama Breeze, and it was great!  The food was fantastic!  Our reception was at 9pm so we did the appetizer buffet for about 25 people, and everyone loved the food!  The atmosphere was light and fun, and I think everyone had a good time!  The only reason I only gave it 4 stars was because a few times throughout the night the staff would come up to me and ask me what to do or what needed to be done, and I kind of felt like it should be their job to already know what should/needed to be done.  Other than that the staff was very friendly and we enjoyed ourselves!I've gone multiple times and highly recommend this to anyone that goes to Vegas.

My only criticism is that everyone's weight is listed on the sign in form after people check in so everyone can pretty much see everyone's weight that checked in prior. Also, during the instructional part, the instructor had the form face up in the middle of the room so, again, everyone's weight was on display.

If you have no issues with your weight on display, then you'll be fine. For most of us gals, this is not a comfortable situation.This place was recommended to me by a friend who comes to Vegas frequently, and I was not disappointed. It looks a little shady at first, right next door to a liquor store in a strip mall. But the staff were all very nice, and we were seated right away (at 7 pm on Friday night). 

You can't beat the value- there are tiers to the menu, depending on your entree. I got the ziti with pomodoro sauce, which was the lowest tier at $21.95. The pricier options include steak and veal and can go as high as $38.95. Whatever entree you choose, it comes with house wine, garlic bread, soup or salad, and cappuccino.

The garlic bread was delicious and plentiful (we went through two baskets...there were two of us). The salad was great, surprisingly large and had great leafy greens, not just a bag of iceberg dumped into a bowl. My pomodoro sauce wasn't amazing, but it wasn't bad either. The cappuccino WAS amazing. So, so good. My mom who doesn't ever drink coffee/espresso tried a sip and we ended up splitting it.

The real attraction is the ambience and the adorable accordion player, Gordy. He found out we were from Missouri and played the Missouri waltz for us! Very sweet and he gives the place a lot of character.

The food is nothing earth-shattering but it's all tasty and you get SO much for the money. Definitely check it out, if only to be serenaded by Gordy.Really nice hotel.  Our room was great and we had an incredible view of the Strip.  I'm still thinking about that bed...

The lobby/casino is really spacious and well-lit, unlike most of the other smokey and dreary hotels.I hate to say it (beacuse Steve Wynn is a royal jerk) but the Wynn is one of if not the most stunning and classy-looking hotels oh the Strip. No fake
skies frippery or a cast of characters wandering about (and I realize Wynn owns hotels that fit that description as well), just clean lines, artful
design without being overly ostentatious (at least by Vegas standards!). Also, it has arguably the best buffet brunch in Vegas.Fun and friendly.  

I had a much needed and memorable stay at the Encore but often found myself over at the Wynn wing.  The service staff was friendly and attentive and full of life.  It seemed to be a good balance of crazy las vegas fun and escape to a quiet wing at the Encore for down-time.Pro's: beautiful hotel
          Classy

Cons: stuffy image. Makes me feel like u need a dinner jacket every time you enter.
           The light show although nice, is a bit short.Went here around 3am to try the $6.99 steak special, but I ended up getting a crazy customized 1/2lb angus burger instead. They got everything right except for the sauteed mushrooms which were absent. Burger was tasty though. So was the homemade rootbeer.  Its no Devil's Canyon Brewery rootbeer, but it was better than store bought.  Would love to come here again to try the steak special (which the lady got and enjoyed) and taste their various beers.  And our waitress and host were very attentive and nice. Clientele is very mixed...Whenever there's nothing left to do in vegas....M&Ms WORLD! Sadly because I am underage and cannot gamble or hit the clubs, I go here instead. Its always fun to come and check out their merchandise and take pictures like tourists. Theres always crowds in here and if you're lucky and they're playing those special M&M movies while youre there, watch it! I guess it gets boring sometimes because I go here so much and nothing really changes, but oh well! Giant M&M dispenser on the wall!!This was way better then excepted! The kids had great fun and it was free!I gave my first After-Hour Vegas experience to Drai's, and it didn't disappoint me.

It sounded sketchy at first, because the promoter wouldn't tell me which hotel it's in, but when we saw the crowd trying to get inside at 4am, we knew we came to the right spot.  Looks like it wasn't the easiest place to get in at that time, so all I have to say is it pays to be a girl.  :)

Decor and vibe were cool.  The main room played techno/trance, and the VIP room was hip hop.  The only thing I didn't like about Drai's was that there was a minimum of $50 purchase for credit cards.

Cool after-hours place to check out if you are still standing at 3am.I honestly don't see why there are such bad reviews.......hahaha you just aren't cool enough I guess....

So about 10 of us come together, 3 girls 7 dudes....  us ladies were in for free the men paid the 20 at around 3AM .... after dancing all night I was tired and decided to head back to the hotel at around 6am I change into my vans but I still have my little sexy black dress and head back.... how awesome is that? to be able to LEAVE a club and come back?? It doesnt get any better than that. when I came back to Drais, the music WAS SICK, tried speaking to the dj but he didnt speak english..... HE WAS SO SICK!!! and about them being nazis on dresscode? its bull, i saw so many people in there in jeans and tennis shoes....maybe you should smile? be more talkative? be nice? Can't wait to go back in January!!!!!!!!!!!Two words. GOOD MORNING! I lost complete track of time here and ended up walking out around 7am in the bright as sunlight feeling like I was on a walk of shame!! I had a blast and so did all of my girlfriends, the whole club is pretty big and dark and just ... so Vegas!  Don't let the weird and creepy casino that this place is in change your mind about going in. Good times lie inside!This steak was delicious! I ordered the fillet mignon with mushrooms and completely demolished the entire meal. We had booked the restaurant for four people earlier in the day via Open Table and I noted that it was also to celebrate a birthday. The service was fast and friendly - and we had a surprise little cake at the the end of the dinner.

I'm always a bit wary of eating around the Strip as it sometimes seems like you have to pay astronomical prices for a decent dinner. But this was a great meal, with well cooked steaks,  yummy sides and a good wine list. Would definitely recommend.Wow - for a relatively inauthentic-looking Mexican place inside NY NY I was pretty impressed with Gonzalez Y Gonzalez. 

We sat at the bar and I ordered a very berry margarita and it was KILLER. I couldn't finish it all and the bartender gladly gave me a to-go cup. Started with some chips and salsa - the chips weren't hot but the salsa was perfect - just the right amount of spice. My cousin got the chicken nachos - meh - they were all right, but what really impressed me was the drunken chicken. It was a dinner special that day and it consisted of grilled chicken chunks, grilled veggies and a side of cornbread chorizo stuffing. My mouth was uber-happy (and as many of you may know, Mexican isn't even in my top 5 favorites.)

For Vegas it was pretty reasonable too - huge marg, couple beers, two entrees and it was around $40. Better-than-decent service and food - I'd definitely recommend.Very nice meal! I was looking for something on the light side. I settled upon the rockfish, and I'm glad I did! A very nice piece of fish! The large party I was with decided to eat there before the Beatles show, and it was a perfect evening at the Mirrage! Nice wines and very well prepared foods!Have been here several times...bring your appetite!  Good service and good food.  Don't come here if you're on a diet.I was so pleasantly surprised by this restaurant. The decor and atmosphere were great and the food was too. Service was amazing and the steak was fantastic. It was surprisingly affordable for the quality and service that we got.The service was top notch.
The manager and several wait staff came by to say hello and to see if we were enjoying our food.
We got 8 oz filet special for the grown ups and burger for the kids; filet was a little under cooked (asked for medium rare but it was more rare) but still good.  They didn't have regular fries, it was potato wedges which didn't work out for the kids.I got the petite filet mignon medium rare on the cool side and it was amazing! Perfectly cooked and seasoned. The mashed potatoes had skin included which I'm not a big fan of- but it was tasty. The bleu cheese wedge salad was delicious. The cheese chunks were not too sour like with some bleu cheese and the strawberry cheese cake was on the fluffy side and not as dense as some places.Stopped here for a quick to-go order for lunch on our last day at vegas before driving to airport....got vegetable Biryani.....and that was awesome, wish we had known about this place earlier, would have definitely tried the buffet and other  dishes. the dinning area looked good and the hosts were very warm too. Would surely visit whenever in vegas the next time.Most unlamorous location.
Open for breakfast catering to the Vegas lifestyle and sleep-eat cycles. 
Very friendly staff that actually listen to what you are saying you want and don't want on your bowl. 
The fajita veggies were tender and juicy. The barbacoa was full of flavor.
At first sight, not the best chipotle, but the quality and the service give it the well deserved 4 stars. Maybe if I came during lunch rush the service would be different but at 10:30am on a Saturday morning: RIGHT on the money!First, the wait was crazy. Those reviewers weren't kidding. If you have time to kill like we did, then no problem. We waited in line for who knows how long, 30-45 minutes, but my daughter was content exploring the gift shop and checking out the huge aquariums. 

Our server was friendly and on top of it but a nearby table wasn't so fortunate. He brought out our drinks and we had a long wait ahead of us. 

The animals in the "jungle" come to life every 15 minutes with fake lightning.

My husband ordered the mahi mahi and tempura shrimp which was good but came out warm...barely. Same with my daughters mac n cheese. 

I ordered the tri-colored tortellini which was delicious and came out hot! 

For desert we ordered the volcano which is wayyyyyy bigger than the picture looks but was delicious.

After all was said and done we spent $80 for the 3 of us to have a meal, soda, and share a desert. So pricey but it was a fun experience. If it weren't for the warmish food and the wait I would definitely give 5 stars.We had our 12 year anniversary here. A great experience, waiters and waitresses are addressed formally. The spinning salad bowl: it's ok, it's more for show vs giving the salad more flavor. The little pudding breads are great for soaking up the prime rib au ju. The prime rib was delicious, I suggest medium. And caution the portions are big , the second size up is just right. Creamed corn: not bad, it's like corn bits in a very sweet n creamy white sauce. Also, let lawrys know if you are there for a special event, you will receive a complimentary dessert, very nice and again a big portion for dessert. Of course beer and cocktails will be at night club pricing. And also, expect a little wait: we had reservations booked 2weeks ago for 8 pm and got in around 8:30 but its worth the wait.The good: Any laundromat where you can play an ol' school ms pac man arcade machine while waiting for laundry is kick a$$. A nice gentleman working here helped me out when I was reading loading instructions. I guess I looked confused. Clean place, free WiFi, free soap if needed. 24 hour Walgreens right down the street to buy suds n bubbles. If playing ms pac man is not enough, you have your choice of a dive bar named "champagnes" or a subway while waiting.

The scene: I got to talk to some interesting characters while there. One guy, maybe 90 yrs old wearing a hospital bracelet (i think they just kicked him out), said he knew me. Showed me a silver ring with a stone inlay wrapped up in a napkin. He offered it to me. Not sure if he wanted money, but he told me to take it. It might have been worth $1 million dollars, but I told him he should hang on to it. N than there was a gentleman that wanted to tell me he could smell my exhaust, and I might need a tune-up. I explained to him that my car was highly modified and I needed to re-map the computer. He actually understood.  Even though I suspected that he and his traveling can collector had not owned a car in some time, it was nice to meet another car enthusiast. What looked like to be a prostitute sat down on the stone wall. Maybe looking for some high rollers at the laundromat at 3am. I did not talk to her.

The bad: If you have a lowered car, do not use the side street entrance/exit. I lost some more fiberglass/paint :(This place was a pleasant surprise! My sister and her boyfriend insisted on going to Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill for lunch. Not having $30 to drop on a sandwich, my friend and i chose to browse the forum shops for something cheaper. We randomly came across Stage Deli and since neith of us knew exactly what we wanted, we stopped to choose from their large menu. I settled on a chili dog which was delicious! I had to ask for a side of onions and a side of cheese to complete the chili dog, but once it was all together, it was good!  The chili dog, itself was huge and so was the bun (what a concept). The chili and the fries were all delicious. My friend got a meatball sub which she seemed to enjoy and thank GOD they never put a bucket of pickles on our table. Its like they knew i hate pickles . .Pleasantly surprised by Tuscany. Many off strip locations get a bad rap and usually for a good reason.  Tuscany is where I stayed during Shot Show 2013.  The staff was extremely friendly and helpful and the restaurants were also very good.  This place was never too crowded and the guests were also very courteous.  Parking was a breeze too.  Rooms seem to have been recently renovated OR they just take really good care of things.  Either way, you are going to be happy.Delicious Filet Mignon.

Wonderful service.

Great food.

Breathtaking views right from your table. 

Splurge a little you wont be disappointed.I had he slow roasted fillet of pacific salmon w pinot noir sauce.  It was fantabulous!  I enjoyed this restaurant as it had beautiful views of the Bellagio fountain displays.Went to LVMS last weekend for the Shelby 400 2009.  What a great time. One piece of advice bring sunscreen!!  We checked weather for vegas and they said cloudy and 77.  Well, I don't know where you are coming from but where I live in PIttsburgh, when they say cloudy they mean CLOUDY!!!  In vegas I think that they just mean there will be a cloud present in the sky!!  Anyways, wasn't expecting to get burnt but we did!!

Also was nervous about the shuttle tickets that we purchased for $40 each person for transportation on charter bus from Tropicana hotel to LVMS.  We got to Tropicana at around 9 am and were VERY nervous there were already a thousand people in line (at least)  However, the line moved very fast. We were totally backed up around the entire hotel and were on a bus within 45 minutes.  Now are seats were in turn 3 & 4. so we did have to walk to the totally oposite end of the track to get to our seats.  But when the race was over my husband and I were on a mission to beat the crowd to the bus pick up. (practically running b/c again we were on far end of the track) Anyways the line for the Tropicana pick up was by FAR!!!!!  The longest line of the bunch. We were FAR back in line too!!  Thought that we were never going to make it back to the strip and expected to be in line for 3 or 4 hours. Surprisingly once the line got moving we were on a bus in an hour and a half wait.  Not too bad cosidering there are 140,000 people at that track.  So, all in all great time at the speedway. May want to choose a different hotel pick up point b/c Tropicana again was by far the busiest.  Hope this helps and enjoy your trip!!The outside may be deceiving about the food on the inside.  I stopped by on my way out west with the family and all of our meals were very good.  The service was outstanding and they even gave us a free appetizer.  Overall I would recommend this restaurant to friends and family.What's one to do when one has a Claim Jumper gift card to use and the local Claim Jumper closes down? Bring the gift card Vegas!

That's exactly what happened to me and what I did. Someone gave a Claim gift card as a gift awhile back but I never got to use it. When the one near me closed down, I didn't really want to drive a long way to another one. When my trip to Vegas came around, I remembered a Claim Jumper that I'd always drive by on previous trips and I decided to bring my gift card with me.

We went to Claim Jumper on a Saturday night and this place was packed! We didn't have to wait for a table however and our menus were presented to us right away. I got the gold rush chicken dish which the waiter claimed was his absolute favorite. The other two in my party got the meatload and a pizza respectively. 

Like other yelpers mentioned, the wait time for the food to come out was long! The waiter came by twice to apologize and tell us the food would be on it's way. We were all pretty hungry by the time the dishes came out.

It was a good thing though that we were hungry because the portion sizes are huge! Both the meatloaf and the gold rush chicken dishes had two pieces of their respective meats. These dishes also came with a biscuit, mashed potatoes and grilled vegetables. 

The gold rush chicken dish was good. The chicken was tender and flavorful with the melted cheese on top and it well with the oh so soft mashed potatoes! I loved the grilled vegetables! It had a good mix of eggplant, carrots, zucchini and squash! Yum! I got to try a little bit of the meatloaf and this was also good. The meatloaf had a tomato like flavor to it.

The dishes were so big that we had leftovers that lasted for two more meals! (Another's day's lunch and dinner). It was that much food! Unfortunately we didn't have room for dessert but the giant motherload chocolate cake that we saw upfront looked absolutely delicious! Hmm maybe next time ;)?This location of Einsteins has some of the best fast service and made as you like it offerings around.  It is a great bagel, lunch, all-over quick place that is clean and has a wonderful, happy staff.  Their cinammon scones are terrific with a cup of their timed (when it was bewed) coffees.  They also have some special coffees and other offerings.
The only negative thing about this location is the hanging out people who use it as a 'clubhouse' for hours discussing the world and taking up space!  Also, meeting-up groups do not belong here - they will sit and chat - the volume then goe up and they waste seats - and feel that this is their eatery.. Again, they take over the place and make regulars try to find a spot to sit.
Outside, you can tie your dog to your chair and enjoy your coffee and bagel ( a
schmear or sandwich) andbreathe under a little patio area.  
I like a neighborhood bagel place  it makes me remember my NYC roots and the generall-overall politeness, yet mind your own business attitude, of the diners.  
This is not a fancy place, far from it, yet, it is clean, friendly, and comfortable!
Keep up the good things about this location!Very nice place. Great atmosphere and great food. They have many great choices for beer and they are pretty good beers. If it is nice you can sit outside and it is very enjoyable. My wife and I loved it and would definitely go back.It has been years since I have been to Rocco's...I used to come here almost weekly for their pizza (Their White & Their NY Style Cheese) but health choices have kept me away from pizza in that frequency and I somehow forgot about Rocco's.  They recently had a Groupon for their pasta dishes.  I said to myself, "Self, remember how great Rocco's pizza is?...well maybe you should try out their pastas too huh?  And btw, since we're talking and we don't do that all that often, I just wanted to point out that you are a beautiful person...smart, funny, good looking, humble, etc....just thought I'd point that out."  I was obviously flattered by conversation, but I also decided to check out some pastas at Rocco's.

All their pastas come with a nice Italian House Salad and a couple Garlic Knots.  I went with the Rigatoni Zingaro - Sausage, Hot Cherry Peppers, Fresh Mushrooms and a slightly spicy pink sauce.  I love pink sauce!...and they did it wonderfully!  Also ordered the Chicken & Broccoli Alfredo.  Both were very nice portion sizes...easy to save some for lunch the next day.  Both came with ample sauce for dipping Garlic Knots as well :)   The Alfredo was very solid--the sauce a little thin for my liking.  The Rigatoni was wonderful!I am sick of people saying this place doesn't have "real" hushpuppies.  Hushpuppies were originally simple balls of fried cornmeal thrown to dogs to shut them up. So I would say that heavily seasoned ones with chopped onions in the batter aren't real hushpuppies. The hushpuppies here are simple and delicious, especially with honey butter or tartar sauce.

This place has great catfish, and I am a big fan of the AYCE crab Mondays. They don't always make it obvious, but if you get the AYCE crab, you are also welcome to AYCE catfish, shrimp and french fries (it makes sense, since each of those is cheaper for them than the crab--EDIT: apparently they changed this; it's now a couple bucks extra).

Unfortunately, this place is often pretty dingy, and the busyness tends to keep the staff from being very attentive.

I've been going to this place for almost 20 years now, and I highly recommend it. Just don't whine about not being able to take food home if you get AYCE. It's a common policy and it certainly doesn't deserve the type of nasty reviews such as the one from last October.I'll preface this review by saying that I eat here ALL THE TIME and have never had a bad meal. However, some menu items are better than others, in my opinion.

So you're probably wondering about the catfish. I love it. I love it to the point that my (seafood fanatic) husband couldn't touch another piece of fried fish for six months after I made him eat catfish for dinner daily for two weeks. Luckily he's over his aversion, as we went through the (highly convenient) drive-thru just the other day! I won't say this is the end-all, best catfish in the world, but it's in my top two or three.

The ribs are really good too. I'm usually cautious about ordering ribs because I am very picky about them. My usual fears are unfounded, as The Hush Puppy prepares them just the way I like them: crispy/charred on the outside, falling off the bone and not sauced to death. I take it a step further by ordering their (excellent, btw) barbeque sauce on the side rather than slathered on the ribs themselves. The Wednesday (and Saturday too, at the Nellis location) AYCE rib special comes with catfish, fried shrimp and probably some other stuff I cannot recall. I think one time I was able to eat judicially enough to be able to order a second plate of the ribs, but AYCE for me these days translates to "damn, not nearly enough!"...

For those of us not wanting to die of a heart attack on the way out of the restaurant, I can recommend a couple of "lighter" options. The crab legs platter is ridiculously cheap and B-I-G. There's also a combo plate featuring only grilled items: "Cajun Fantasy". It comes with a blackened catfish fillet, a skewer of grilled shrimp and stuffed oysters, if I'm remembering correctly. It's definitely not a heavy dinner and is the only thing I've ever ordered that I am able to finish. 

The basket of bullet-shaped hush puppies brought to the table shortly after sitting down is always solid. I like them with or without the honey butter, but c'mon, what WOULDN'T be made better by honey butter? I've always been accustomed to more savory hush puppies, usually with onion inside. This is an interesting change.

There's a small salad and condiment bar offering up a good chow chow (which I will put in and on nearly everything on my plate), tartar sauce, cocktail sauce, some typical salad items/dressings, coleslaw, potato/macaroni salads and maybe one or two other things I am forgetting. I usually make myself a little salad, take a spoonful or two of the mayo-based stuff and get my condiments before dinner. I was initially taken aback by the fact that you get your own sauces, but I quickly realized that for a sauce-Nazi such as myself, it's a blessing. I've always found the salad bar area clean and with fresh items, personally.

The restaurant itself is rather oddly decorated and has many different rooms/corridors. Half the time I get lost on my way to and from the salad bar. That's okay though, and I think it would be a brillant place for a large group, since many of the "rooms" have just a couple of tables. More often than not, I hit up the drive-thru, though the drive-thru's menu is limited. Great value, whether or not you eat inside, and you can feel good about supporting a long-standing local eatery!I brought in my $29 worth of penny rolls. Teller was helpful with no judgments and made little conversation with me. I like when tellers genuinely ask how I'm doing rather than saying it like going through the motions. also great eye contact.Full disclosure: Sentimental favorite. We went to the original on Maryland Parkway when my wife and I were dating 15 years ago. It was a treat for us poor college kids. When we vacation in Vegas once a year or so, Paymon's is always a must do. 

The fried calamari appetizer is well done. Nothing to rave about, but it's good. The real draw, for us, is:

The "gyros in pita" is awesome. Lots of meat, plenty of veg, and a wonderful tzatziki sauce. Always pair it with Athens fries. 

Overall, the food here is fresh and clean, with nice Med flavors. There's something here for everyone, including vegetarians and carnivores. This place is just solid: Never had a bad experience here in over 15 years!We had dinner at Rosemary's on a Sunday last month.

I arrived early and peppered the hostesses with questions on dishes they would recommend, the art on the walls (from local independent artists and available for purchase), and the age of the restaurant. I also found out they offer full-service catering. The hostesses were friendly (they put up with me) and knowledgeable.

The place eventually became crowded. It was somewhat hilarious (and a little offensive) how one kid was watching a DVD at the table (who brings their kid - and their personal player - to a place like Rosemary's?). It was all the more obvious since the room was dim (relatively speaking: the tables in the front bar area were better lit). Our dining room suffered from "mood lighting" and would benefit from seat or table spotlights; I like to see what I'm eating. Others may argue that they don't want to see their date, so this place may be good for you!

Service was outstanding. Our primary server and his assistant explained every dish (even the beer selections). Like Perrier's Le Bec-Fin, the servers were enthusiastic and placed the dishes on the table in unison. Unlike LBF, the servers didn't buzz around the table like insects.

I was running on an hour of sleep, so I (wisely) refrained from having alcohol but a friend had the beer-meal pairings, which he enjoyed.

A few of us ordered the chef's tasting menu ($70). Compared to typical tasting menus, the overall package was a generous size and we weren't able to finish it all. The courses which grabbed my attention (even through my sleepy stupor) were:
- l'amuse bouche (I was amused)
- First course: salmon tartar appetizer with watercress, caviar, crackers and a saffron sauce
- Fourth course: rack of lamb with Kalamata olive mashed potatoes, fried arugula, and a rosemary bordelaise sauce (mmmmmm - quite savory and the lamb was oh-so-tender)

Lackluster courses:
- Second course: Panko crab boulettes with marinated cucumbers (flavorless)
- Third course: Crispy skin striped bass with hushpuppies and a creole meuniere sauce (not too much flavor, and not a fan of fish)
- Dessert: I don't remember the dessert - not my thing anyway.

Rosemary's is 30-40 minutes from the Strip, but worth the cab ride there. It's popular and is booked quickly, so reserve your table in advance!I came to meet friends for drinks, and decided for a snack.  Chicken tenders were so good.  They didn't taste like your average tenders, super juicy and great crust.  My friends had nachos they looked ok.  definitely get the chicken tendersGreat selection of toys and food for my 2 crazy cats. The sales are great and being a pet perks member actually saves you a lot of money.

My favorite part about this location is the friendly staff. They all seem to like working there and are genuinely friendly. 

Least favorite part is items aren't stocked as often as they should be.Not real quick but everyone was so damn friendly! This goes for all of the area Starbucks BTW but we frequented this one the most.Lovely date spot with great food. Food took longer than expected...think the kitchen was backed up...but still had a great dinner.We stopped by Yama sushi on a road trip out to Bryce Canyon - all you can eat sushi for 17 for lunch? Sounds like a great deal - we went with more typical rolls {RAINBOW ROLL, SPICY TUNA, YELLOWTAIL} we stuffed ourselves and got a little more towards the end our server suggested some of their specialty rolls (which most of us always avoid because of the heavy sauces) but we weren't disappointed we ordered a few rounds of {PALM JOB} and unfortunately can't remember the names of the others - we went off a lot of other help reviewers too.  

We enjoyed our experience so much we went back a second time on our way back.  Definitely worth a visit if you are in the area!I've been to Olive Garden before but not this location.  The night started out on a bad note when another customer outside the restaurant got a little irritated with my husband for walking between her and her group. She gets one star and a Quick Tip: Don't block the walkway beyatch!! Moving on to the actual restaurant: They have the best minestrone and breadsticks!! I could have filled up on those alone but I forced myself to save room for Seafood Alfredo. My dish was good although I like my shrimp and scallops a little bigger. Our server seemed a little overwhelmed, as she was obviously rushing. Overall, a pretty good experience. The soup and breadsticks will always bring me back!I do enjoy stumbling upon local mom-n-pop shops, especially when they're good!  This donut shop is a mere hop, skip, and a jump from my office at UNLV, which means too much sugary temptation during the afternoon slump.

I bought a couple of chocolate iced and vanilla iced donuts -- with sprinkles! -- and the first bites revealed pure yumminess.  The girl behind the counter said that those were the freshest.  They were!  Donuts are under a dollar each, which makes it easy on the budget when you're craving a sugary something or other.

I'm sure the offerings are even better first thing in the morning, when a lot of the donuts are made.

In addition to donuts, one can purchase sandwiches here! (?)  I'll think about trying one of those next time.

Al's Donuts is located behind the 7-11, a few doors down from Roberto's Taco Shop.First let me clarify that this review is for the food side of Rum Runner- NOT the bar side. 

I love this place. I've seen all different people eating here- young, old, teenagers, families, groups of friends, businessmen- so many. When a place can appeal to so many different people and their tastes, it is a very very good thing.

I'll be honest, I haven't been very adventurous here. I've only tried... maybe 4 things on the menu. When I come here, I only really come here for two things:

Wings. and Burgers.

They have a flavor of the month sauce- always interesting, mostly good. Though I usually stick to teriyaki (my favorite) and get the wings blackened. They're usually pretty good about this... you mark teriyaki and blackened and they will do all the wings like this- dipped in sauce and then blackened. Though recently they served us a plate with 3 blackened wings and 3 teriyaki. I was kind of put off by it but I was hungry and the server was kind of... loud anyway so I just shrugged and ate my food. I would surely clarify in the future though.

The burgers are delicious. I think its now $4.99 to build your own burger. They have allllll the toppings- bacon, grilled onion, pickles, thousand island, fried egg, etc. All they need is to add some avocado (not guacamole- very different) and they'll be set! 

Being from california I tend to be a little picky about my burgers. A good burger to me is a diner style burger with the bacon and avocado deliciousness- and while this isn't Pauls Place or Angelos, its about as close to home as I've found so far. 

Ps. 
Since this is connected with the bar you can order coke with grenadine (cherry coke) and it is much more delicious than that generic spray stuff.Beer! It's my favorite, and Crown & Anchor has a great selection.  Having British grandparents, and a father and uncle who grew up in England, a place like this just feels right.  Fish and Chips are tasty, as well as Cornish pasties!  But I love the giant Yorkshire pudding!  We always had Yorkshire for our Sunday roast beef dinners, and this one taste just like the family recipe. I love the layout, and the outdoor seating option, but I prefer sitting in the bar, near the dart boards, where I can find soccer or rugby on one of the tvs!  Its a great place to gather :)Lunch special buffet for $9.99? Hell yes. 

Best Indian lunch buffet around, with dishes also set out for vegetarians and vegans. It is a little smaller than most buffets I have been to, but there is still a great selection. I got the chicken tandoori and tikka masala, tried a bit of the goat curry, and pretty much ate up the vegetarian half of the buffet as well. Overall, an excellent steal for the price!

The standout for me was the kheer, it was some of the best I had. I also tried a mango custard which was delicious. I would say it's a MUST if you are in the area or would like some Indian for lunch.My husband and I have been to several Indian restaurants in Vegas, and this one is our favorite.  We drive all the way to Mint from Summerlin b/c the closer Indian places just don't make food as good as Mint does.

Restaurant is clean, simple decor, staff is nice, and you can't beat the $9.99 lunch buffet they offer.  Buffet isn't huge, but does offer enough delicious choices to be satisfied.  Also comes with Naan.

I'm especially a fan of the Chicken Tikka Masala...it's my favorite Indian dish and they know how to make it right here.  Definitely check them out when you're in the mood for a good Indian meal.Out of all the Indian restaurants in the Las Vegas area this one is my favorite.  I have never had a dish that I didn't love and service has always been greatThe tropical fish market in Vegas is horrible. Not a bad selection and great staff. Picked up two gold compressiceps for my brothers tank. I thought the prices were high in my town but  Vegas is almost double, probably because there is not much competition. Closed on Sundays!It's been a while since we last stopped here for a meal.  It was a busy Sunday afternoon but we managed a booth right away.  

The adjacent table had a nice looking margarita, so I ordered one and enjoyed it immensely with our appetizer.  sopitas steak chorizo's, six hand made corn tortillas lightly fried and filled with beans, lettuce, cheese,  sour cream and joice of meats, we had chicken steak and chorizo.  Very good.

For my entree I got a combination plate, I love too many things to just pick one, so a combination plate allows multiple selections.  So I got the morelia, a chili relleno, chicken enchilada and beef taco.  All three my favorites.  

The food is fresh, cooked well, with enough flavors and spice to satisfy.  The service is quick, the restaurant clean, and well managed.My favorite for Mexican in Las Vegas! Been to the one near the strip and on Flamingo. What I appreciate is that the recipes are truly Mexican... not American-Mexican. The menu explains each dish and the spices in detail. The hand-made tortillas really make a difference and the wait staff continually ensures your complimentary chips, salsa and bean dip are always full!. Had the Chipolte chicken and it was tender, spicy and smoky. Our son ordered the lemon chicken, something I probably would not have ordered.... that is until I tasted it! Fantastic! The guacamole they make table side can be customized to your preferences and they even put jalapenos on the side for us who like it spicier. Very accommodating. Live music in the bar at the one on Eastern, and the waiters do a  mean happy birthday at both locations accompanied by guitar!!Well stock grocery store, with all your liquor and beer needs satisfied as well. 

Always well kept,  clean and services,  Vons is a great stop before your Vegas adventures. We stop here every time we come to vegas to stock on on nessecities: booze,  granola bars and other snacks. 

Close to the airport and the South end of the strip,  save your money and load up your hotel room!Oh Rampart how I hate to love you sometimes, and love to love you! 

First it is good to note that this casino is not very large at all, in fact it is quite small.  The crowd is mostly older folks, 50+, but I've noticed at times waves of young people come from time to time.  I have been going to Rampart just about every week for the past 6 months, and I keep coming back.  

They have these cool U1 machines which offer awesome video graphics for video poker, keno, and slots; the chairs are super comfortable and you can reserve the machines for up to 6 minutes if you need to walk away!  

After I have spent my free play and a little more I usually check out the Irish pub located right between the casino and hotel, nice little spot with live music on Fridays, possibly Saturdays too, but I've yet to go inside on that day. 

The ambiance is nice, the cocktail waitresses are SUPER fast and SUPER friendly, and the patrons as chatty and fun as well.  It is a favorite place of mine that I intend to keep coming to again and again.  Give it a try if you're around!My fiance and I have been here a couple of times. White tablecloths and a quiet, comfortable atmosphere--with jazz music playing in the background. They have an interesting menu, including Chinese and Thai food, and tasty appetizers. This is a nice place to sit down, relax, and enjoy.  We were well served and our food was delicious--both times. The house salad is simple but has a nice ginger dressing.Horsey Carousel or mountain high ice cream?  Depending on the day, you can enjoy both!
This place is packed with knick knacks, circus figurines, moving sculptures, toys, you name it all over the walls and ceiling.  If you have ADHD you might want to put on some sunglasses.
There's a carousel outside that you can buy tickets for in the summer, but to be honest there is enough going on inside.  Food is good.  Basic. Hot dogs, burgers, noodles, mac and cheese, salads, etc. 
Ice cream sundaes, cones, and other deserts are delish and just how you remember from your childhood.
Your kids will be wound up on sugar, over stimulation visually and will want a treat at the candy counter on the way out.  Hopefully they'll pass out on the way home and you get some quiet moments in the car.
It's fun.  It's crazy. But those are some good memories.Truthfully I appreciate a well crafted hair cut by someone who listens to what I want and then does what I asked for and yet manges to add a few extra things I hadn't thought of but I still look great. It may at times be intimidatingly hip but everyone I've ever had lay hands on my hair (that'd be Jason and Kristen) has gotten it right. [... and I cannot say that for many of the places I have frequented in the past.]I love this place. Long wait but worth it. Live music. The food is sooo good. The guacamole dip is amazing !! They make it in front of you, and I tried to memorize what the waitress was doing so I could do it myself at home...but it didn't turn out the same.Delicious! Guac was great as was the soup and our meals. A bit on the pricey side though :)Not your average Mexican food. They make their own mole sauces. Stuffed chiles are incredible. Many good fish dishes. Pasole is great. Been there many times . It is the barrio, but great food. Only problem is, always busy and a wait.The Carne Adobada is the best in town and I love the salad they provide before the meal.  I have tried many dishes at this place, Heidi Pasta great and I like the trio  that includes the enchilada and tamale but I am hooked on the adobada.  The only downfall is the wait,  sometime I am just too hungry.  A girls gotta eat!!I've been to this one and the one in Mesa on Alma School. The food is excellent. In terms of food only, I think it's arguably the best in the valley.  It's spicy, flavorful and well prepared.  Anything on the menu is delicious. 

Regarding the "spice" factor. If you are not used to eating ethnic food or spicy food, the salsa will be really hot for you so avoid it. If you are used ot eating Indian, Thai, Chinese etc. then you will actually like the sauce and question why all the other salsas in the valley are bad.  

That being said, the Service is horrible and it's been horrible for the last 10 years or so.  They charge for refills on chips. They give you very little chips in a small tin bowl.  They don't refill your drinks. They take forever before you order.  They are inflexible in altering items to cater to vegetarians (Im not vegetarian but I've been there with vegetarians). The waiters have attitude. 

If the service was somewhat respectable, I would eat there more often. Still the food is delcisious but go there with the expectation that you will pay a lot of moneyand endure horrible service.  This is one of the few places in Phoenix that I will endure bad service because the food is so good.I have been here 3 times now.  I can't complain. Hot means Hot here.Barcelona is what Scottsdale is all about.  The best place to go for drinks, listen to music and people watch.  And the happy hour lasts until around 9p!  My friend and I had about 10 berrs and I think our bill was about $30.

About 10 of us went for New Year's Eve 2006 we had dinner and entry to the club for $75/pp.

I love the outdoor patio.  The staff are very polite.  Its just a fun place to go!I finally got around to trying out Sapporo for happy hour last night.  During the month of June, they are offering HH pricing all the time - great for those of us that work some strange hours and can't always get were we want to go by 7pm!  

Even though it was a Tuesday, the place was packed - fantastic people watching.  While there were plenty of people who were there only to be seen (look at me!  look at my outfit!) there were also those who looked like they came out after work.  Our waitress was awesome - she was covering portions of both the indoor bar area and the patio and she was totally on top of our orders.  Thanks!  The HH prices were very good - $4-$8 for most sushi rolls and $6 for my oh so tasty white cosmo.  For that price, of course I had to have more than one!I don't live in Arizona and I absolutely love this place! There is a great happy hour with beer and cocktails and food. You can shop for clothes and grab great food and drinks all at the same time. If you are in Scottsdale this is a place you want to check out. And don't forget to try and sit outside since the weather is always perfect in AZ.I used to go for their amazing crab cakes and the sauce that went with them.  They changed the cakes to these skinny little things, still good just not amazing.  Our server was great and knowledgeable, quick and nice.  I love the relaxing atmosphere and they have a nice wine selection.  I will go back, just not for the crab cakes until they switch back ;)I can say this could be one of the BEST Thai Restaurant outside of Thailand, or Thai Town, Hollywood. The only complaint I have is the papaya salad could be more authentic with ingredients such as Thai green beans, salty crab, dried shrimp and more spices. 

But I will definitely come back with friends to try the many dishes they have on their menu.A concept table service burger joint plus full bar in the shopping zone of Mandalay Place, from chef Hubert Keller of Fleur-de-Lys fame.  The concept is that you choose a base burger (3 kinds of beef, lamb, turkey, garden, etc), one of five buns, and then pile on your choice of about 40 toppings at extra cost, ranging from homemade beet pickles to a half lobster or a fried egg.  The $60 Rossini burger (with foie gras, sliced black truffles, and madeira sauce) is something to try at least once and the $16 regular Kobe burger is good too.  Knowledgeable and courteous waitstaff, great ingredients.  A real temple of burger-dom.  Only two reason for four stars instead of five are: 1) bar concept though ineeds work and better mixed drinks (but does have 24 beers on tap); and 2) prices a little high, and really, after all that it's still a hamburger.You can do some crazy things with burgers here, add lobster or foie gras (sp?) or even truffles. But if you keep it simple with their angus burger it will still be goooood.

This place is located in Mandalay Place which is the shopping walkway in  between Luxor and Mandalay Bay. The prices are definitely steep, you start at $8.95 for a regular burger but then your add ons like cheese, mushrooms, etc, cost that extra cash. Fries and sides are extra too, by the time you're done you paid a pretty penny for burgers and fries. I recommend the sweet potato fries.

Service did not check on us once after the food arrived, maybe he knew we were trying to be cheap cause we split a burger and he didn't bother??? HAH probably.

edit***
 
Went to Gordon Biersch and ordered a burger, I swear it was just as good, and probably cheaper.I am not a burger girl by nature, but I love this place. 

Somehow the over-the-top fine dining joints in Vegas always seem as faux as the facades of the grand, theme hotels. But the Burger Bar somehow manages to fold the essence of excess into a place that is casual and cool, comfortable with what it is without the need for dancing waters or gold leaf bathroom fixtures. 

The concept of the burgers are somewhat build your own, so you can get virtuous with your order if you want. Or you can go all-in with the Kobe, double orders of shoestrings and hell, they'll probably top the whole thing with gold leaf if you ask nicely. It is Vegas, after all. 

What I like most about the Burger Bar is that, although it is a casual, relatively quick eatery, it is owned by one of America's best chefs and one who cares about ingredients. The same attention goes into food quality here as it does in a Michelin starred place. So, if you want to eat the same quality of food as the upper crust, just get it served on a bun, I think you'll enjoy this place.FOOD - 5 stars
AMBIENCE - 3 stars (meh - boring/any old bar and grill feel)
SERVICE - 3 stars (meh - passable/not bad enough to complain)

This was our first time at Hubert Keller's Burger Bar.

We selected:

1) Chef's favorite burger with two changes: swapped out buffalo for Kobe beef; swap ciabatta for a soft whole wheat bun.  (Chef's favorite is buffalo with spinach, carmelized onions and blue cheese with a red wine and shallot reduction sauce on ciabatta) -  approx. $25

2) Build-Your-Own - Angus beef with green asparagus, oyster mushrooms, bacon and peppercorn cream sauce on a soft onion bun - approx. $17

3) Skinny (plain) fries - approx. $3

4) Glass of house merlot ($7) and glass of Red Diamond cabernet ($10)

Both burgers were amazing.  They nailed medium rare on both.  We split them in half and shared.  We savored every bite.  We couldn't really decide which we liked better.  The flavor on the Chef's Favorite might've won by a hair, but the texture on the Build-Your-Own was much nicer than the texture on the other (the crisp bacon, al dente asparagus and earthy, slightly chewy oyster mushrooms were all a nice contrast to the tender burger and soft bun; the Chef's favorite was pretty much all soft, melt-in-your-mouth-no-teeth-necessary kind of mouthfeel.)

Fries were good; not too greasy, not too salty.  We rarely ever finish an order of fries, but we ate all of these and dipped some in our burger sauces!

House merlot was fabulous minus (boring, a bit watery, not fruity like a Merlot should be.)  Red Diamond cab was much better.  It's a $10-11 solid table wine you can find at Sam's Club.  Would've liked to see a little bit bigger selection on the wine list (there were only about 4 reds by the glass and 6-7 total.)  But I guess they want you to drink beer (extensive beer list by country.)

Service was hit-and-miss with server forgetting about us twice for a long time.  Also, right after we sat down, she came by to take our order; we asked for a couple minutes, and when she returned she brought us a check.  She had already set it on the table and started to move on before she realized she had the wrong table.  That was a precursor on the service.  It wasn't horrible, it was just thoughtless.  Either she was distracted or tired or somewhat indifferent to her job (not sure which.)

Ambience was also a disappointment.  I would've expected something unique or inventive.  Nada.  Take away the menu and the food and I could've been in any average burger place anywhere.  No hint I was in a top-tier chef's restaurant at Mandalay Bay.  Kinda noisy; too many little kids and crying babies for my thinking (we had a 10:30 PM dinner.)

But for me, food is king, and the food was grand.  We were pleasantly surprised by the bill; under $65 before gratuity.  It was yummy enough that I actually thought, "I could come back here again...tomorrow."What can I say... I love the Burger Bar! My husband and I always make a trip here when we are in Las Vegas. We just stayed at Mandalay Bay over Labor Day weekend so we had a short walk to one of our favorite spots.

I have to say, the Kobe Beef is one of the best I have ever had. It is so delicious and just melts in your mouth. But if you want to keep it basic (and less expensive) the Angus Beef is a great choice as well! You really can't go wrong.

The only reason I am giving Burger Bar only 4 stars is because our server was a bit off. When we told him he left bacon off of one of the burgers, he said "well then there's a kitchen full of Mexicans I need to go yell at". It was so off color and uncomfortable for our entire table that we really didn't want to deal with him any longer.

Other than that odd experience, the food and ombiance is amazing.We went to the half price ticket office and got tickets for this show for about $60.  They only offered mezzanine seats, but when we got to Rio, the theater wasn't full at all and the seater there just sat us out in the front rows.  I liked this show because it's funny and they do some pretty amazing magic.  They also allow you to take pictures with them and sign autographs afterwards.  Very personable people.First off the location is ideal... it looks right over the Capitol and in Madison, that's as pretty of a view you're going to get for a down town dinner. Chris went w his b school class and learned all about how passionate they are about organic and sustainable food. You can definitely tell. For me, even the tomatoes were scrumptious and I think that is because they were freshly picked from the chef's mini garden. The service was fantastic, very polite, treating you like royalty without being pretentious or floofy. We need to go there again so we can write a more robust review. (Chris has been there 3 times and has adored each visit!) The only downside (if any) is that it is a little pricey for rustic elegance. We will go there again soon and report back... ~ChristerraOur favorite fish fry.  The friday fish fry menu has a lot of selections including non-fried options.  Great potato choices including yummy potato pancakes and baked potatoes that are actually baked in an oven.  The portions are huge and the price is a real bargain.
Try the mango vinaigrette on your salad.  Its awesome.
The service is excellent.  You have multiple waiters/waitresses so you never wait for anything.  Its really a great way to do things, especially when its packed.
They also have a very nice selection of beers on tap.This is seriously a hidde treasure..SERIOUSLY it's not the easiest to find but when the journey is worth the wait. AZ/88 has an AWESOME atmosphere and looks like a posh resturaunt but the great surprise is that is it affordable and definately a place to impress a date! Great indoor and outdoor seating. The menu had a variety of salads, burgers and sandwiches & the food was tasty and drinks are even better! It's open late so it's a great place to go for drinks before going out, dinner or lunch.Love this place for their bar! Fun atmosphere and upbeat. Good Martini's and Spirits. Good place for a date night.I usually hit one of the Oregano's every time I come to Phoenix. They are always good and always consistent. This time I tried the thin crust pizza instead of the stuffed pizza. I was hoping for a NY style pizza, but it was more of a Midwest style thin crust. The crust was thin and crispy. Not like an Italian wood-fired crispy, but a nice Midwest crispy. The sausage was fresh and not frozen. They used a good cheese and an above average pepperoni. All and all, a very good pizza combined with great customer service.Everytime I asked someone where would be a great place to shop in the area, this place is the answer I would usually get.  

Close to the base of Camelback Mountain, this place almost reminds me of Ala Moana Center in Honolulu (http://www.yelp.com/biz/ala-moana-center-honolulu) with the sheer size and endless places to park.  With that being said, there is so much parking, it is hard where in the hell to remember not only where you parked, but how you got there!

This place seems to take up a few city blocks, and even goes over the street once or twice.  It's a decent size mall, and its anywhere from 2-4 stories at any given point.

Lots of store options and lots of fancy store options at that (hence the name of the mall).  I liked the fact there was a NM there- one of the main reasons I kept going back.

I like how the food court is on the bottom floor and you can get a great view from above.

On a side note, after I left NM, I started walking back to my car (at the opposite end of the mall) and it was weird because I walk pretty fast, and I noticed someone was approaching me at a steady speed.  Some chick came up next to me, walked side by side, then turned around and bolted into a men's store.  She was cute, but that $hit was too weird for me.  I mean to me, that was like a gold digger on recon!  She must have ran when she saw my face :).

Another nice thing about this place is that if you cant find it in the mall, there are a crap ton of stores right near it...Okay, I live up the street. I remember when this was a small, open air mall. Times have changed. It's huge. It has everything from sports memorabilia to Italian fashion. It's a place where I like to people-watch. I'm not a big customer here because the place just has a bit too much of the "Snottsdale" feeling to it. By that I mean people trying to impress each other and themselves. They never buy much, but they walk around with their noses in the air. That's okay. It's the culture of Scottsdale and I accept that. It is fun to sit down and observe and listen in on the one-upmanship that goes on. 

I patronize many of the companies that are represented at SFS, just not there. I waled into one store for an item I knew they carried. The sales girl had no clue. I pointed to it and she picked up the wrong one. They have an AT&T store which is virtually bare of products. Why? But this isn't a criticism of the mall, but of Scottsdale and this mall gives Scottsdale what it wants: Image and little substance. 

But that's the community this mall serves and it's a good fit. I don't need to pay to see the circus when I can come here for free. It's just plain amusing.In comparison to all the hotels on this end of the Strip, New York New York is one of the nicer ones despite of its cheesy theme. There is also a lot of stuff going on. There are tons of restaurants and bars. It is also kid friendly because it has an arcade and a roller coaster.

The last room I stayed at had windows on two walls. So I saw a view of south of Las Vegas Blvd. and a view of MGM. Pretty darn cool. The room decoration was nice. The beds were still comfy. The bathroom was obviously a little bit older than everything else in the room, but it was super clean and had fresh new towels.

I would recommend anyone to stay at New York New York. I guarantee you will have a pleasant experience.Since I can't afford the Palms most of the time, I have to have a back up cheapish place to stay in Vegas, and I usually choose the LV Hilton.  I'm in their player's club (whose player's club am I NOT in??) so they send me deals in the mail all the time.  $199 for three nights plus free buffets?  Yes, please!

I love this hotel because it was just remodeled, has a decent pool, several happy hours, they have inexpensive gambling, and a ton of  food options.  Also it is home to Barry Manilow, and the Star Trek bar, Quark's, home of the Warp Core Breach and Borg Sphere punchbowl drinks!  Nerd watching potential is high at the Hilton.  

Definitely request a renovated room.  Great beds, and if you can get them to put you in the North tower, that's the concierge tower and you get access to their 24th floor lounge with free snacks and drinks 6am - 8pm.  This plus free buffets equals not paying for much food and hence more money for gambling at the $5 tables (day time only).

It's not terribly fancy compared to, say, the Wynn or Bellagio, but Elvis played all his Vegas shows there, so it's got built in street cred.  Not to mention a 20 story tall poster of Barry Manilow on the side of it.  If it was good enough for Elvis and Manilow, it's sure as hell good enough for me.I was visiting Vegas for a friends wedding and my coworker suggested that we should stay at the Paris. I passed this recommendation along and all of us stayed there. I split a double room with my friend.  I was very happy with my stay at this hotel.  I have stayed at other hotels in Vegas before, one a lot more expensive and one tons cheaper.  

The rooms are nice and if you're lucky to get a good view then you're really lucky.  The bathrooms are decent size.  There were a lot of mirrors in our room, however, the "red room" that my friends stayed at didn't have any mirrors in their "room" only in the bathroom.  

It was twice as much to stay on Sat. as opposed to Sunday night.  

I would prob. stay at Paris again during my next visit.  The pool is really great, your friends (from other hotels) can also come by and hang out and its fun to just chill out and stare at the Eiffel Tower.  

The restaurant service(s) in the main floor can be a little slow.  The services at random places are really hit or miss.   Had a great time at the piano bar but not so much at the little bakery next door.The casino/hotel: Very crowded, congested hotel/casino for sure. I had trouble walking the narrow 'replica of a street in Paris' with the plastic-feeling floors, which seems like they would pose quite a problem for anyone walking heels. Also, the gambling floor is mostly slots.

The room was ok, but our shower was awful. The water could never get hot enough and I could barely wash my hair in the water pressure, which was extremely weak. So bad. Also, I've never actually been to a Vegas hotel that had a lock on the door - is this in case someone ODs in the bathroom or something? I don't get it. At least the room came with a mini-fridge, and the beds were an OK size.

Don't expect to get any cell reception or WiFi in this place. I felt like I was cut off from the entire world. It was awful.

I didn't dine in the hotel at all so I can't really tell you about that, but the pastries in the little cafe looked delicious. Coffee menu looked expensive and bland, they had some cheap hot chocolate machine behind the counter. I really wanted to try Mon Ami Gabi but didn't get the chance to. I can tell you that all my friends bragged about Gordon Ramsay Steak being delicious and the name of the restaurant was a running, albeit immature/not-all-that-funny joke the entire weekend. "Uhm, excuse-eh me, it's not 'Gordon Ramsay SteakHOUSE', it's 'Gordon Ramsay Steak'." If you don't feel like shelling out the big bucks for some beef wellington, head on down to the conveniently located Planet Hollywood. You can have Gordon Ramsay's Burgr for reasonable prices like $14 per, if you can stomach staring at the pictures of him around the restaurant.

The concierge was very friendly and accomodating, without seeming fake.

Overall an OK experience. I've only bumped it up a star because it was in a pretty decent spot on the strip to reach other things by foot. It's closest to Planet Hollywood, but you can trek up the stairs and down towards The Flamingo and get in some roulette.The Monte Carlo treated me and my two girlfriends well, and I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a decent place to sleep and sun. The room was as basic as it gets and the subdued decor was a warm welcome after staying a previous night at the heavily themed Luxor. It's worth the price and location on the strip.
I stayed this past weekend (6/8 to 6/10) and noticed the construction nearby for the new City Center. NOT A BIG DEAL! We had a mountainside view and only heard construction once in the middle of the afternoon. The poolside was great, but the music and atmosphere was definitely geared towards a younger crowd. Pool bar $7 drink special was also great. I was pleased with my stay and will return as long as the price is right.This is probably the best value in Vegas. We've stayed here several times and are spending a couple nights this weekend. For the base room, we avg. $50/night. That's not bad for a themed hotel that is clean with lots of great shops. 

The only annoying thing: Jabbawokee music playing every time you enter the elevators. I'll take the stairs. They aren't booking the best shows/entertainers, but it's better than some of the other hotels.

When we left in February they were in process of putting in new Samsung flat screen TV's. This is a nice upgrade, seeing as how the old CRT's had their day. 

Overall a great place to book if you're on a budget but still looking for a place that's clean.

Pro tip: join MLife so you can get really good deals. d.Vino is a must--great food, great prices.Really good hotel for the price.  Very luxury looking for a cheap hotel price, which i was suprised how cheap it was to stay there.

PRO's-Hotel lobby was absolutly beautiful, chandelers everywhere, checkin fast, free upgrade to strip view but the hotel doesnt have a real good view of the strip anyway =( hallways were very pretty decorated with motown artists, room was very big, comfy beds, old tv though, but bathroom was super nice. toiletries were from their spa which was a plus, double sinks, big closet, and bathtub.  Casino was very nice and super clean, employees nice, awesome food court, and affortable resturants which is rare for a property like this.  good location, good crowd.

CON's-parking is terrible, the garage is kind of a far walk, there is a side parking lot that is full most of the time, pool was nice but couldnt use it because no available seats. buffett was kinda of small for the price.I didn't know what to expect at all from Zumanity. The tickets are pretty expensive but if you go to half tickets you can get cheaper tickets. 
When you walk in you already are in the show because their are performers right from the beginning. It's awesome. The show was fun extremely x rated especially if you go with your mom it can be a little awkward.
There is nude parts not completely nude but it's Vegas what do you expect. I thought it was great especially the Catholic school girl who twisted around with hula hoops. I really liked the show but I wouldn't go see it again.I have only stayed in 2 other places in Las Vegas and this was my first visit to The Venetian.  I was honestly expecting some run of the mill room but was so pleasantly surprised!  The suite was HUGE, with a very large bathroom that had a separate soaking tub and large glass shower.  It had a door to the toilet, double sinks, and a separate sit down vanity with a lighted mirror.  And speaking of mirrors, there were also full size mirrors on the bathroom door and against the entry wall.  As you walk further into the room you had a bedroom area with two steps down to the huge living room with a sectional sofa, and a desk that had a scanner/printer.  My view was of the mountains.  The lighting was fantastic, especially for a hotel room, and I loved the remote control sheers and blackout drapes.  The room had 3!! count em 3! TV's.  I loved staying in this room.

The only reason I didn't give it a 5 was the service at check in and check out seemed very harried...as if the person wanted to get rid of me as soon as possible.  This happened when I checked in, and when I called to check out.  C'mon, you can take an extra 30 seconds to pretend like you value me personally.

The property itself is beautiful, with painted ceilings, coffered ceiling in the casino, and a very nice smell.  The only time I ever smelled cigarette smoke was when I was sitting right next to someone who was smoking.Came here for a guys weekend trip last weekend and got a great deal on one of their penthouse suites. This was my first time staying at the mirage and it will definitely not be my last. The room left nothing to be desired and I now wont be able to stay in any room of a lesser quality when in vegas. All of my interactions with the staff were top notch. 

The only reason for the one star missing was that the shower in the second bathroom was horrible. I understand that it has to handicap accessible but the shower head was 4ft high and while the shower was 6ft wide it was only about 2.5ft deep which made it near impossible to comfortably take a shower.We've tried qutie a few steakhouses and restaurants in Las Vegas and I think this is one of our favorite in Vegas.   Their steaks are so much more flavorful, tender, juicy and just cooked perfectly.  We've tried many hyped up ones but they fail to meet our expectations. with Demonico, we were not disappointed at all. 

this is off topic but since we are talking about steakhouses, stay away from "the cut" restaurant at palazzo, not good, not worth it. see my review on it if you need to.The delmonico was delicious, the potatoes were excellent, and the deserts were amazing.  After dinner I was thinking about dessert and they suggested the banana cream pie.  Normally banana cream is not my favorite, so I was somewhat skeptical, but the server said that if I did not like it they would not charge me for it. so I gave it a try.  It was amazing, I would recommend it to anyone, but you can get it at any Emeril restaurant so dont go here just for that.  Overall pricy, but very good.The is the second time me and my bf stayed here.  The hotel is huge but offered a varity of resturants and activities.  The rooms were spacious and clean.   I loved the lazy river and the pool.  The hotel is in a good location, so once you leave the hotel you're near the M&M shops.You should know what you are getting into.

Double Down is a fun, wild, filthy punk rock bar. You will love it. For locals, it is one of the leading live music venues. For tourists, it is an iconic landmark.

THE DO NOT TAKE CREDIT CARDS
Any they will politely point you to the ATM machine if you try to pay with one.

Be sure to grab a t-shirt and a PRB & Beef Jerky special.I'd definitely stay here again! The view of the 3rd floor roof was kind of lame for the price that was paid, but the bed was comfy. What I liked best was the bathroom (of course!). Nice and big and the shower was too hard water-y. 

Oh yea, the cool pirate show that is live with real actors is pretty awesome. Just don't get disappointed if they have to cancel it due to high winds or unpleasant weather conditions. 

Overall, it's not my favorite hotel but there's a Walgreens across the street that is open 24 hours so its really convenient to purchase your snacks and h2o.booked on expedia.  
Cheap!!!!!!  
In the middle of the strip!!!!!
They have beds.  'NOUGH SAID
Their bar rock house is low maintenance fun.The best things-
*sitting outside on the strip
*the gluten free bread/ menu and free olives
*$5.50 drink special that was a Frangia
*the chocolate mousse

The average things-
*the frites
*the croque monsuierre sandwich
*the service
*prices are pretty darn decent for the strip

The not so great things-
*that having a reservation didn't get us a quality table.  Was given one right in the sun with no umbrella up and then moved to the far corner.
*the macaroni and cheese was peppery and really not that good.  (You want a good mac & cheese then you MUST go to Nine Fine Irishmen at NYNY
*minimal vegetarian options on the lunch menuThis is the perfect place for a dinner date! My boyfriend took me here on our anniversary so that we could eat at a classy restaurant and watch the Bellagio water show across the street. Our server was very friendly, the steak was amazing, and the price is pretty good (by Vegas standards). I've seen from other reviews that brunch is also apparently great here so I'll definitely be coming back someday to give it a try.My favorite French restaurant in Vegas (: I think lunch menu is much better than the dinner. If you go, try getting the steak sandwich they have and get it with the fries. Great service, friendly staff up front. Definitely recommending this to everyoneGet the streak frites.  That is all you need to know.Taking price into consideration, the food here is nothing exceptional...greasy French bistro stuff. But the view from the patio is exceptional for people-watching! It faces right out onto the Vegas Strip, so you'll get an eyeful of the wacky passers-by and street freaks, with the occasional spouting of the Bellagio fountains across the street to liven things up.

If there are no seats available on the patio, however...no dice. The food isn't worth coming here without the view.This is the third time that I came, so I'm giving a combined review of the restaurant. 

I tried the warm Brie appetizer, good but not great. The steak is good, but had better elsewhere. Scallop appetizer was something memorable for me. Dessert was nothing memorable. The views are good if u sit at patio. The view itself is worth 5 stars!Had breakfast here.  Great location.  Great, yummy food.  Nice Gluten-free selection.  I would have expected their coffee to be better though.  Great people watching.  You can also see the Bellagio fountains from the patio.  Super friendly service, unlike the real Paris.  Highly recommend.Looks like a neon factory threw up in here. For added bonus: cherry blossom trees that reach the ceiling, and flamingo lampshades. This place screams tacky in ways I never thought possible, and to make it even better, mirrored walls and ceilings amplify your...experience.It is surreal in the best of ways.

Facing a grim flight after nearly a week of avoiding casinolands and focusing instead on the awesome climbing and desert hiking that the area contains, I was hesitant to go into a place that I'd imagined as a kind of cartoon of a Vegas cliche. I relented primarily because it looked a reliable redoubt against the desert heat.

Guess what?

It was a cartoon of a Vegas cliche on steroids and psychedelics and it is truly a worthwhile stop.

With cocktail servers who all look like they stepped from a TV commercial opposite Ricardo Montalban, a surreal decor that verily shouts 1970s pickup scene, and a fountain that shoots flames, the important thing here to note is that they serve cocktails in glasses bigger than my head (and I'm a bit macrocephalous), it has subsequently become my most ritualized stop in Las Vegas.

I can't speak for the restaurant side. Because I don't know why you wouldn't just stay in the lounge side.My partner and I stayed here for 3 nights in a spa suite.

Pros:
Clean room, bedding, and fresh towels were provided daily
Clean casino
Open casino layout, easy to navigate
Easy parking
Walking bridges to Mandalay Bay & Excalibur
Cocktail waitresses were plentiful
Friendly employees
Quite room (We didn't hear anything from any of the rooms, or outside)
Egyptian theme lobby and rooms (may not be for everyone)

Cons:
No WiFi.....WTF??!!
Armoire and night stand were a bit beat-up
TV was old, but worked since we only use it for weather channel
Time share people (but they are easy to avoid)

I would say overall it's a decent and fun hotel to stay at.Always fun getting lost in the pyramid. Great restaurants, gaming and entertainment.Dear Luxor: I wish I knew how to quit you! This past weekend, my friends and I stayed at the Hard Rock, and it was TERRIBLE. We dropped a lot of money on a suite that wasn't worth it, experienced terrible customer service, and felt like we were ripped off of our time, money, and holiday weekend. The whole time, we kept wishing we would have stayed at our spa suite at the Luxor like we have been for years now (although we were told the jets aren't working). You may not be the fanciest hotel, but the staff is always friendly, the rooms are nice, and the atmosphere is fun, but not over the top or douchey. Plenty to do with the nice lounge downstairs, Tacos and Tequila, and the Body and Titanic exhibits. I can go to the shopping center and pick up some bubble bath at Lush, or just walk around the lobby....it's kinda quiet and calming! We plan on going back in July to celebrate our friend's birthday (and to re-do what happened this weekend), and we WILL be staying at Luxor. We hope you'll be good to us and deliver a fun, relaxing weekend as we have come to now expect. See you soon :)Mandalay Bay is my favorite hotel to stay at whenever I visit Vegas.  The only negative thing I have to say about Mandalay is that it's pretty far down on the strip, but besides that it's perfect. The rooms are nice and big, the crowd is young & fun, and some of my favorite restaurants and lounges are in this hotel (Mix, Red Square, Rum Jungle).  If you can you should try to upgrade to the Hotel Mandalay because the rooms are unreal.We stayed at Mandalay Bay this past weekend and overall we had a good experience.  I read through the yelp reviews before my trip and it I was able to prepare for some of the negative things that happened.

The hotel is beautiful.  I am a Vegas frequent and I can find all my needs at Mandalay Bay.  Whether it's fine dining or just casual eateries, this hotel offers it all.  We were able to check in at noon once we arrived on Thursday morning.  The room was overall clean and really nice, the bed was sooo soft and comfy and the two flat screens (one in the room and one in the bathroom) were a plus.   The bathroom was great with the marble tile, granite double sinks and separate shower and bathtub.

The beach was a lot of fun!  Summer hours are 8AM-7PM.  There were a ton of people, but we managed to find at least one chair to put all our stuff and we spent the entire time at the wave pool.  If you come around 5-6PM, most people leave to probably go to dinner or prep for clubbing, so sometimes there are groups of seats that are available.

Ok, here are the negatives which I agree with other yelpers:
- The line to check in was absurd.  There are so many windows for people to walk up to, but they only open 4 lines making the wait at least half an hour to check in.  We saw one elderly woman try to check in after standing in line for half an hour and she was told to come back later.
- There are lines for EVERYTHING, from baggage check in to taxis to elevators.  Be prepared to add an additional half an hour to wherever you are planning to go during the weekend.
- There were a couple pillows that had a musty smell, I didn't want to know why.
- Our "recuperating" sign was taken away from our door, not cool.

Overall the stay was awesome.  I would definitely be back to Mandalay Bay to try out more restaurants and just chill by the pool.My husband & a few of my cousins came here in December. First time in Vegas, didn't really know where to stay - but Mandalay offered us a suite upgrade for the second night & who can say no to that. First off the front desk service at check-in was excellent. Everyone was very nice and accomodating, we arrived in Vegas at 10am and they had a room ready for us even though check in wasn't until late afternoon. The size of our room the first night was good, it slept my husband & myself plus my 3 cousins who didn't make it to their room that night. The suite upgrade room was even bigger, with a view overlooking the strip. All in all we had a pretty good stay. The hotel can be a bit confusing though, its pretty big and there aren't very many signs that tell you where to go. It was a mystery looking for the elevator entrance to take us to our room upon arrival. Also, gift shop was expensive for the late night munchies, so we stocked up at the Walgreens down the street. 

We would definently stay here again, it was affordable, rooms were spacious, bed comfy, large shower, suite had a tub and extra long vanity plus the clock radio was an ipod dock (awesome) and the staff was great.Stopped by for the chance to shoot some automatic weapons at zombie targets. It isn't cheap and there was a long wait, but it was worth it. Even the most novice shooter, or first time shooter, is made to feel comfortable. It is a very well controlled environment and the staff is very knowledgeable.All the way on the third floor of the new Ceasers Palace, is BOA steakhouse. This is yet another steakhouse transplanted from a tiny original version situated on Sunset Blvd at the Grafton Hotel. This restaurant in LA is such a hot spot, well it used to be anyway. 
The decor of the LA store is super fab, intimate, and dark. BOA in Las Vegas attempts to capture the LA store but it is far larger and more open. I do like the food here though. Steaks come out hot in skillets almost and they can be carved for you table side. Sides are inventive, as many new steakhouses are now days. I will say, the view here is cool, and they have a fun patio that looks out to the strip. 
The place is really far out of the way, I would recommend valet parking at the forum shops from the strip entrance and going up the elevator, but the walk out to the casino is for real fifteen minutes, don't wear your jimmy choo's.I went to BOA a couple of months ago with my girlfriend for a romantic date. I had super high expectations from the start. The staff there was very friendly and made you feel comfortable. We first started the night with some amazing drinks that the waiters recommended. When I opened the menu I was blown away with the prices of the steaks, but I said lets do it. The steaks we ordered were top of the line greatness. I tad bit out of my price range but well worth it. I believe I went into a food comma after we left because that was the end of my night. I cant wait until my next Vegas trip, I will go back to BOA.What's not to like about a restaurant named Pink Taco! Well, during my stay in Vegas, I really wanted some Mexican food, and my local friend took us here.  I wasn't expecting authentic Mexican by ANY means, but this place sure delivered on taste.

First off, they bring out various salsas and chips. All were very delicious and flavorful.  I had the chicken enchiladas for my entree. Not much to say but it was tasty enough that I didn't leave a drop on my plate. That and all the other entrees were fairly reasonable also-$10-12 a pop. However, one thing stands out the most about this place is the oh-so-strong margaritas! I definitely recommend getting them and hey, if you don't finish yours, you can always take it to go! I love Las Vegas liquor laws!

One minus-it's located inside the Hard Rock hotel off the strip, making it difficult to get to without driving to it.Definitely a fan of this hip Mexican joint in the Hard Rock!!  Happy Hour is legit.  Get the Appetizer Sampler.  The fried ice cream is off-the-chain!!

Wait staff is always friendly and prompt with the food.This is one of my favorite places in Vegas and a place I try to visit whenever I'm in town.  The food was awesome (as it always is) but the normally excellent service was lacking this time.  

It was very clear that our server, Jessica, had better places to be than be at work doing her job.  She was rude and I will make sure that she never serves me again.Listen.  When you want to do Vegas the right way, you go to Bouchon's for brunch after a long night out with your friends.  It will be one of the most amazing breakfast/lunch spots you'll find there.  It's hidden in the Venetian and when I say hidden, I mean VIP hidden.  You go up the elevator and arrive on a floor that's filled with all things decadent...high ceilings, lots of gold and elegance.  The food is nothing short of spectacular.  I literally had my breakfast and lunch there...LITERALLY.  I recall having their french pastries with a cup of latte and then moving on to their chicken, bacon and chive waffle in ONE sitting.  It was delicious!  I highly, HIGHLY recommend it for your next visit.  The price is a little more than your typical breakfast fare in Vegas but it's completely worth it!Good food, service is great.

Have been here twice for breakfast and had two good meals.  Drinks are a little pricey but hey, it's Vegas.Excellent food... but for the slow service

Was excited to try Bouchon as a Thomas Keller fan.  To be upfront, Bouchon is no French Laundry.  The latter blew me away whereas, Bouchon was excellent but unremarkable.  

I had the chicken and waffles, which were superb and the waffles threw me for a happy loop with the bacon specks cooked in and the flavored butter.  Other folks in our family had rave reviews for the Tartine de Thon, Bouchon French Toast, and trout dish.  Gravlax and Croque de Madame were said to be good.

Service staff was very nice, though remarkably slow in their execution.

Couple criticisms: 
(1) Service was exceptionally slow!  Ordering took about 25 minutes.  It was about 50 minutes before food was on the table.  And paying was the equivalent of a race with your chunky buddy on your back.  All in all, our dining experience took about 2.5 hours.  
(2) The Bouchon Pastry Basket was grocery store caliber.  Two of the flavors came back as unavailable.  Then, when the platter did arrive, they all had cold centers.  Seriously, for $13 for four pastries, I would expect thorough reheating.
(3) We sat in the back right and with things taking so long, the sun was hitting us hard.  My cousin and I started eating lunch with our sunglasses on.  As the temperature on my phone crossed 90-degrees, I called over the staff and asked to either move or have them pull some kind of shade.  They kindly put an outside umbrella against the window which helped greatly.  They were very kind in responding.  I would have liked it more if they had thought ahead reacted to our discomfort without being asked.  We aren't the only ones who have eaten at the table.

In sum, excellent food, slow service, nice staff, a few knocks on food preparation, and a some small doubts on quality for the price.What a great place to spend a morning! I say morning because by afternoon, it gets pretty hot, since it's not shaded at all. Great variety of stores, loved Dolce & Gabbana, Kate Spade, Elie Tahari, Juicy, Salvatore Ferragamo, Lucky and Miss Sixty. The customer service at the Kate Spade Outlet deserves a special shout-out, way WAY  above what you normally find in an outlet setting. Burberry was a mess, merchandise all over the damn place, hard to find anything and prices were about the same as at the non-outlet location. Bleh. If it's an outlet, at least let me feel like I'm saving A LITTLE BIT OF MONEY, right?! I'm just grateful I didn't have my little princesses with me or I would have left a lot more money there! 
Not a bad cab ride from the strip, but a good thing happened when we were in the cab line waiting to leave; a limo driver, clearly thinking on his feet, gathered several of us going to the same hotel and took us back for less than the cab ride! Score! A much more comfortable ride! 
The one and only downfall was that I couldn't find any place that served alcohol!  I was just short of devastated, then I spotted the Dairy Queen.  Obviously not the same, but a smoothie really helped keep me going. I just enjoy shopping ever so much more with a cocktail in my hand! Now before you start thinking "wow, Liz, you're such a drunk", remember, I was on vacation, okay?!
I highly recommend this place for some less pricey shopping than you find on the strip.They have a yummy mongolian beef dish!We come here for the steak special, it's not on the menu but you can order it for 7.99,  food and service is good. Yes make sure you get your players card!Fabulous happy hour spot. We managed to get a table outside late one Friday afternoon, and we had a blast. The service was prompt (no waiting for drinks) and friendly. We didn't have any food, but the menu was appetizing, and the food that came by for other tables looked pretty good. The location makes it a little pricey, but hey, you're in Old Town Scottsdale, so what did you expect? They also have TVs at the bar, but I don't know if this would be my first choice for sports event watching. Nonetheless, this is a great choice for happy hour.This is the first restaurant at which I've eaten in Madison, and it was a great way to start! I went with two friends who live here because it's their favorite restaurant downtown, and wasn't disappointed. We started with the cheese curds appetizer, which was tasty and awesome, and then I had a burger that was cooked perfectly and full of flavor.

I'm sure I'll be eating here again.Pretty good macaroni and cheese as well as the tomato panzanella salad. They make their own beer as well as soda (red cream soda, ginger ale, and cola maybe?). The service is pretty good. It can get really loud here, but they are accommodating of larger groups.Run of the mill pub.

Consistent and simple. Great Dane's got a decent selection of drinks and food. Doesn't disappoint. You'll know because the place is almost always packed.

Their bagel/bacon/sausage burger is amazingly tasty and one of a kind. I've also tried their Asian pork belly bun, which was surprisingly good given how Asian food goes in Madison.After reading the reviews, I made a reservation beforehand and planned to arrive an hour before so that we could eat as soon as possible.  Upon arrival, there was no line, but the hostess seemed as if we were being rude by showing up an hour early for our reservation.  They said that they could seat us in the side overflow section immediately, and since I didn't know any difference, we agreed.  

The Food:  The food met most of my expectations.  Luxurious ingredients with no limit.  My lobster tail was overcooked, but my friend said his second tail, which he picked up right when they replenished the serving tray was perfect.  They had a made to order omelette and crepe station.   The sushi station was nice, but the fish was just ok.  My favorite items were the shrimp in the shrimp scampi (the pasta was over cooked, but the shrimp were plump and cooked perfectly), the lamb chops on the carving station, and the cavier which I decadently ate with everything.  The cold station was a bit of a disappointment (the stone crab claws were not good), but the desserts looked beautiful. 

The Service:  There were 2 waiters in our section, and i don't think more than 5-7 tables that were filled (about half the room), but for some reason they seems overwhelmed.  We didn't get any attention for a long time.  I had read that they constantly refill your drinks, and that the service was impeccable, but we were sitting there for a good 5-10 minutes with empty glasses trying to catch the eye of a waiter.  I'm not sure if it was because we were in the overflow room.  I noticed other tables had baskets of bread/pastries, but we were never offered any.  And I heard from another diner that there was a vodka bar somewhere but we were never offered any.  Having paid what we did, I expected the servers to be much more attentive, so all in all, that was a disappointment.  

Overall:  The price is high for a buffet. Even though the food items were all luxury items, I felt like the preparation could have been better.  I would have rather spent the money to go to a nicer sit down restaurant.  The all you can drink is good, but would have been better if the servers were more on top of it.  I would maybe try it again with seating in the main dining room, as I think the service and ambiance may be better.When I tell people where I grew up they often respond with "I didn't know people grew up in Las Vegas." True, it's a transient town but whenever I get together with fellow natives I find it hard to resist the pull of the buffet. 

This much I've learned: Atlantans have fried chicken. New Yorkers have bagels. Bostonians have lobster rolls. And we Las Vegans have the buffet. Though I managed to be in LV for less than 48 hours, I made sure a trip to the buffet with a couple of old friends was on my itinerary.

On Sunday morning we waited about 20 minutes in line for the chance to gorge ourselves on prime rib, mashed potatoes, creamy corn chowder, soft serve ice cream with Butterfinger pieces on top, shrimp, roast turkey with gravy, slices of cheese, sushi, grapefruit segments, champagne and a lot more that I cannot recall at the present moment.

But as I dug into my plate I looked across the table at my friends and said, "Now I feel like I'm home. . ."Whoa.  Talk about gluttony.  Wonderful wonderful gluttony!  

Having missed out on the Vegas buffet experience the last time we made it point this time.  And since we were staying in the Bellagio, and it's supposedly the "it" buffet on the strip our decision was easy!  

Sushi, and meats, and cheeses, and fish and gorgeous salad bad!  Oh my goodness!  So after 3 plates, and then 3 tiny dessert plates we walked out ashamed to have eaten so much and took a nap like you would on Thanksgiving!  Except, I definitely did not wake up wanted seconds!  Stuffed!One of my favorite buffets in Vegas....awesome goodness

This place, in my opinon, is BETTER than the Wynn buffet because not only does it offer a wider selection of food, it is also a few bucks cheaper than the Wynn.

Yes, there's always a long line, but what do you expect? It's the Bellagio Buffet for crying out loud! 

If you're ever here on a Saturday for lunch, I'd recommend that you come around 3pm (a late lunch), pay the lunch price, and stay until dinner. Dinner is served at 4pm and this way you can pay $25 instead of $32-33 for their seafood dinner!!

I love their dessert selection...the sugar free strawberry cheesecake is to DIE for...nomnomnom. Highly recommended!Get the brunch and get there early. The wait is ridiculous! The food is ok to very good, definitely not the best buffet in Vegas. But it's all worth it for the non-stop, free mimosas if you have a hangover that you want to drink away. I left with a full stomach and a great buzz. That's always a nice way to start your morning in Vegas.I would come back here again.  Just don't make this buffet your last buffet for the Buffet of Buffets especially if you're in a time-crunch.  I came here with about 40 mins left on my 24-hour Buffet pass and almost didn't make the cut because the line was long and it took them forever to seat everyone, even though there were TONS of tables on the seafood side.

Unfortunately for me, because of the Buffet of Buffets, I wasn't that hungry.  But it's ok because seafood doesn't really fill you up.  So I went on an all out crab legs binge.  I do love the crab legs there: snow crab (which means those large crab legs with huge pieces of meat and not the scrawny ones you normally see in crappy buffets) and they're cut in half so you can easily extract the meat from the legs.  Yummmmm....

The shrimp cocktail is also peeled for you so that's a plus since I can't stand peeling shrimp.

As for the prime rib, I really didn't pay that much attention to it.  I had 1 slice and I still don't think it's as good as Paris' Le Village Buffet's prime rib.

Our server was decent and pretty attentive.  I found the Usher/hostess ladies a bit on the grumpy side though since we heard them yelling at a couple who prematurely sat at the booth she was going to take them to anyway.This is one of my favorite buffets in Vegas and it still has the old buffet name when the hotel use to be called Aladdin so Caesar's Entertainment is still lagging on the Planet Hollywood renovation. 

But anyways this buffet is located on the basement level of Planet Hollywood and when the lines get really long particularly on the weekends, it can snake around the casino towards the strip entrance. They even offer you to move to the front of the line for $20! But if you are a highroller for their Total Rewards program then you have your own line to avoid this cluster FUCK. I prefer the Mlife program because they have better buffets and nicer resorts (Bellagio, Aria, Mirage, NY NY, Monte Carlo, Mandalay Bay  and the lower tier Luxor and Excalibur).

I always experience great service here except for a few that are minor, the food is just your typical Vegas buffet and not over the top like The Buffet at Bellagio and Wynn also the new Bachannel Buffet at Caesars (REALLY IMPRESSED).

The decor is just plain with movie posters all around the Buffet and the staff has their favorite movie posted on their name tag I thought was pretty cute. The dessert station was the best with the fresh made cotton candy, lollipops, crepes and the usual cakes and gelato ice cream. This isn't on the top of my lists for buffets but I wouldn't mind coming back.Just like every other club in Vegas, it's going to be overpriced and overpacked but this place still sits on top of my list. Why? The venue is large and there's actually room to walk and dance! Wow. That coming from a club? What a surprise!

Of all the times I've been here, the staff has been A LOT better than other clubs. I've just come to the conclusion that going to clubs in Vegas is like going to the DMV. They can treat you like shit because they know you HAVE to go inside. 

I'll be back.Just say you know Brandon.

...Okay, don't say you know Brandon. Actually, to tell you the truth, I don't even know Brandon. But somehow, by name dropping some guy I don't even know, I was able to bypass the 2-3 hour line for Tao on Halloween, get in without cover (the guys in our group didn't have to pay cover either) and party it up on the dance floor with a bunch of guys in cow costumes.

(Cow costumes? Wow, that's hot.)

Actually, I was never a huge fan of Tao, even though, both times I've been, I've gotten in without cover. The first time I went, the dance floors downstairs were playing house (not my thing) and I got into a huge argument at Tao Beach. (Yay for drama in Vegas clubs!...Not.) Considering that experience, I was a little apprehensive about going back to Tao again.

Boy, was I wrong - Tao on Halloween was crazy! Like I said, I got to dance with a bunch of cows, the DJ's were bumping great dance music, they had Tera Patrick hosting/emceeing for the night (although I couldn't tell if she was hot or not though), and it was just good times all around. 

Notes to remember: 
- Do not dance on the furniture (I found that out the hard way). 
- Do not bother going to Tao Beach - it's too crowded, there's really no room to dance, and the bathrooms are ridiculously far away from the general Tao Beach area (as I discovered during my first outing to Tao). 
- Worse comes worse, name drop Brandon. (Hey, it can't hurt, can it?)Both times I've been to Tao (would've been 3 if I didn't forget my ID and attempt to do a pass-back and then get caught... whoops...haha) I've noticed a trend: If you try to get there early you will undoubtedly be faced with this longass line that loops around the 2nd floor of the Venetian (or even outside the doors!). Best bet is to go late and either get walked in by a promoter or smile at the bouncers as they unclick the velvet rope :)

Solid music. Lots of celebrities roll through this spot (Rev Run was there the last time I went but we didn't see him!). Dance floor gets PACKED but empties out to a comfortable crowd around 2 or so. I love love love the bathrooms here - they have clear doors that fog up once you turn the lock around 3x! AWESOMESAUCE :)Pretty good club. My friends and I have a good time here every time we come. Thursdays nights here is actually pretty popping cause its worship night or something. The ratio of girls vs guys is good since then won't let guys go in alone pretty much. So either bring girls or bribe someone so you can line up with them! Entry was smooth but the line moved a little slow even though we were on the guest list. 

Dance floor is pretty small but nothing matters when your're drunk! There's a big bar before you enter the dance floor (you really can't miss it). Music was really good and the ambience was awesome. I'd definitely come back here over clubs like XS which are overhyped and full of sausages.THEhotel is THEmost elegant of all THEhotels on THEstrip. You don't feel like you're in Vegas when you're in THEhotel, with its lofty and airy but dark paneled walls, beautiful and simple bouquets of white flowers, and an excellent collection of art hanging on THEwalls (THElobby has pieces by Robert Rauschenberg, Robert Long, and Richard Serra). 

THEsuites are spacious and THEbeds are comfortable. 

THEswimming area includes a gigantic wave pool and a lazy river as well as a few other pools and hot tubs, with a "beach" full of lounge chairs and cabanas that you can rent for $250 or more per day. THEbeach and pools were incredibly crowded, so we only stayed a short time. 

One complaint - they charge for wifi, which in a hotel that expensive, you'd think it would just be included rather than nickel & diming you. 

Also check out my review for miX, which is THEfancy restaurant in THEhotel, owned by celebrechef Alain Ducasse. It was nice but incredibly expensive. 

My favorite thing about THEhotel - THEsticker that they leave on your toilet paper that says "THEtp".I loved the decor of THEhotel as you walk in with a nice, sleek, contemporary feel to it along with the tall, black and white walls, clean glass doors and fresh white flowers of lilies, roses, and carnations.

Our one bedroom suite was nice, but reminded me a lot of The Signature suites... only smaller. The layout was eerily familiar with the living room attached to the one bedroom, the padded headboards, the large bathroom with a seperate tub and shower, to the seperate bathroom with a phone in there. 

Honestly, a really, really nice hotel, but for the price AND the inconvience of the location, the Signature would be a better deal. A taxi from our hotel to the Venetian would cost about $20 each way not including tip. =(

One of the best part of the hotel? THEbeach at Mandalay bay's pool. Can you say Wave Pool? Super cool. THEbeach was awesome. So if it's your first time staying here, I would recommend coming to the pool here since you have to be a guest at the hotel to even get it.My mom and I had a girl's weekend last week and she was kind enough to take me to Bartolotta.  A foodie friend familiar with all hot spots in Vegas recommended it, and II read many reviews on Yelp before we went.  I had very high expectations about this place and told the waiter this right off the bat.  I was not disappointed.  Neither mom nor I was interested in the dead fish tray.  I wanted to want the fish but it did not appeal.  We started with the Ligurian octopus salad, which was excellent.  If it weren't for the glowing reviews on Yelp I woulnd not have ordered it.   So thank you to everyone out there who takes the time to write these reviews.  Then we had the scallops on the bed of porccini mushrooms- outstanding.  We ordered the sheep's milk ricotta and Tuscan pecorino cheese ravioli.  These were SUBLIME.  Perfection.  I will never, ever look at ravioli the same way.   The other pasta dish we ordered, the lasagne strips with sea food was equally perfect.   We ordered the chocolate cake with pistachio gelato, which was absolutely delicious.  A great end to a fabulous meal.  We opted to order wines by the glass so that we could taste different things.  We had the falanghina, vermentino, and chainti classico.   They were each lovely.  The service was very good.  We were there almost 3 hours and no one rushed us.  Our primary server was difficult to understand at first because he mumbled, but thankfully he perked up as the evening wore on.  Our other server was a delight from start to finish.  Overall a wonderful dinning experience.  Only draw back is the price.  It is crazy expensive.  Four small plates, 1 dessert, and 4 classes of wine (not the most expensive ones on the wines by the glass list) set my mom back about $250.  That's a lot of money, even if it's for great food.I had a great time here and the oysters on the 1/2 shell were deeeelish! They're even better when someone buys them because they like your friend and are trying so hard to impress.

We never made it to a table but sat at the bar for drinks. Xavier, the bartender, took good care of us. This isn't the first time I've been here for drinks... and it won't be the last.La Creperie can be found within the majestic walls of the Paris Hotel. After a stellar night out on the town, my 7 girlfriends and I decided to go here since we were starving and our early morning bloody marys were beginning to take effect. 

I decided to try the Seafood crepe - scallops and shrimp and drizzled with bechemal sauce. Delicious!!! It's pretty inexpensive for being Vegas and the best part: you get your choice of dessert or savory. Plus there's the bar across the way :) Go big or go home in Vegas, right?

Cheers!awesome production, totally vast stage and performance. too bad they don't have all the sound tracks recorded, the only disappointing part to everything.A great show! The work they did with the stage was amazing!

They told us that any seat was a good seat in the house- lie. Sit closer if you can. But I had a bad experience because the people beside me were speaking in normal tones the whole show. So annoying! 

Would like to see this show again!This review is for lunch in the Downstairs part of the restaurant.

We're huge Top Chef fans and when we saw Rick kill it on Bravo we knew our trip to Vegas had to include RM Seafood.  We made reservations for lunch on Thursday and in we walked.

The restaurant is absolutely gorgeous.  Water flows about the ceiling  and the open kitchen makes you feel like a part of the action.  The modernness of it all is just perfect from what I wanted to experience from RM.  

We ordered the $24 Surf and Turf Roll (tempura prime beef, cherry peppers, crispy shallots, seared albacore ponzu, lavender honey) and it was hands down the best roll we've ever, and I mean EVER eaten.  I then ordered the Adam's Fish Sandwich (Beer Batter, Tartar Sauce, Aged Cheddar) which was yep, the best fish sandwich I've ever tasted...  though I will admit I've probably only had 3 fish sandwiches in my life.  But still - if I knew every fish sandwich would taste that good, that would be my go-to sandwich.  The fries that came with it were amazingly addictive.  Ohh and the homemade tartar sauce... I practically drank the rest of it in the cup.

He ordered the Fish Tacos Pico de Gallo (Shredded Cabbage, chipotle Cream) and he said they were in the top 3 fish tacos ever.  Super fresh and the flavors were so well balanced.  

Okay, so lots of praise.  Lots of "BEST EVER!!!!"  But, RM Seafood deserves every word of praise.

Why 4 stars?  The service was TERRIBLE.  We were 2 of 8 people in the restaurant and the food took well over a half hour to come out.  The waiter spent too much time trying too hard to get to know us and then disappeared for a long time after we asked him to check on the food.  They didn't take our used plates away after the sushi roll and left us with a cluttered table as we waited for so long for our lunch.  Also?  By the time the food actually showed up, I was too hungry and literally forgot to take a picture of my sandwich.  Which never happens.  I'd actually give service here a 1 star.

All in all though, RM Seafood is everything its lived up to be.  Well done.Hey, those GVR people must have read my review, because it looks like the rooms have been remodeled since the last time I was here. The hotel hallways look a lot chicer with dark walls and abstract patterned carpets. The rooms also got a makeover and the armoire with the tv has been replaced by a set of drawers with a big flat screen. The place is looking better than ever!2 queen beds with a pool view - the room is bigger than the average hotel room and the bathroom is also bigger. It has a separate tub from the stand up shower and the toilet is in a separate room.

The pool area is nice.  Jesse was a great cocktail waitress, she has bright red hair.  Sit in her section and you won't regret it.  I can't say the same about the "pool amabassador" named Emily.  She was super rude.  I intend to email the hotel about her behavior.

With the exception of Emily, everyone was nice.  I plan on returning again next summer for a week.  This is a perfect spot for a family vacation.  It almost reminds me of being on a cruise ship. I love that they have a movie theatre and CBTL on property and lots of cool shops and restaraunts across the street.Ah, the Grand Lux. 

The service is slow, and you may need to wait a while to get a table in this bustling joint (whose interior looks something like a scene from Alice and wonderland ... why do the booths look like mushrooms?), but I really love coming here the first night of a trip to Vegas. 

First , you need to run all over the strip taking in every sight, drink, and game of chance that Vegas has to offer. After exhausting yourself thusly, head to the Grand Lux and order the Grand appetizer platter for the table (try to do this around 3 or 4 am). This is way too much food for two people, but it's affordable and tasty (I especially love the Asian inspired items on the plate). 

While you wait the 45 minutes for your food to arrive, take in the sites: pretty and polished Venetian clientele dressed up and popping energy tablets with their wine (I think they're in from LA). Sitting here is reinvigorating! It makes you realize that you can stay up and play some more poker! You can drink five more $1 Miller Lights at O'Sheas! You can play two hands of Blackjack and double your money! But don't think you can win on those slot machines at the Venetian. You can't.We came here for breakfast every day while we were in Vegas, mostly because it was conveniently located so close to our hotel and we wanted to get to shopping and gambling ASAP. 

We tried the eggs benedict,  breakfast sandwich, and corned beef hash. The star of the show was definitely the corned beef hash. They use huge chunks of corned beef, none of that stuff you get in a can! I shared some with my family and they loved it too! The eggs benedict was okay, I couldn't put my finger on what was missing. It may have been that the slice of ham was too thin or something was missing in the hollandaise. Regardless, the food was good enough to keep us coming back! 

Try to get there before 9. We went around 8:30 on both days and didn't have to wait, but on our way out we saw a huge line.Food is GREAT!!!! Love this location...always a must when in Vegas!  

Only negative would be the service and it is hit or miss depending on the day.

Must have: Double Stuffed Potato Spring Rolls

***Please bring one back to Vegas!!The concierge at Monte Carlo suggested Tryst for our group of 6 for a Saturday night out. We made reservations for bottle service and showed up right as 10 pm as instructed. We got in line but were soon grabbed out of line by Steven Johnson, our VIP Services Manager and we were walked right to our table. Steven was super professional and helpful.

In my previous Vegas bottle service experience the waitress we were given poured the drinks super stiff to get our bottle empty and get us out of that table but at Tryst this was not the case at all. Our waitress was sweet and friendly, fixed our drinks as we needed them, and then told us that we may stay at the table as long as we'd like - even after out bottle was finished. This was fabulous!

My only complaint - If we heard the DJ play "put ur f***ing hands up!" one more time we were going to scream... it was obnoxious.Since we sat in the Vino Lounge for our UYE last night, I guess it's appropriate that I post my review here :)

It was kind of a quiet Sunday evening, but it was the perfect place to chill with a group of people.  The breeze on the patio was refreshing and like Kristin said, they did a good job with the decor with the white linen curtains shielding you from a view of the parking lot...

January, our server, was extremely outgoing and sweet.  I had several glasses of the Sauv Blanc which was light, crisp, and fresh - the ideal beverage for the warm evening we had!  It went well with the food I tasted as well... I tried the petite lobster corn dogs (how can you not order those?!); the handcut pomme frites dusted with indian curry and murray river saltl short rib, seared scallops with yellow curry foam and mango caviar; roasted baby artichokes with brown butter and fifty-year-old spanish sherry; and wild mushrooms with cognac and chervil.  My bf had all of those as well as the cheese plate.  We enjoyed everything we had, even though the servings were pretty small.  I expected the items that were on the dinner menu to be larger portion sizes, but everything was on the small side, so be prepared!

The menu items we ordered added up and got a little bit pricey, but it was a fun evening, so it was worth it!  Thanks again to all of you who came to hang... we'll have to do it again soon!Great little find. Inside and outside dining options. For a starter I ordered the Calamari Insalata - very good (1/2 portion), For Dinner the Agnolotti Boa -Raviolis - Excellent, for dessert we shared the homemade Cannoli - PERFECTO!Ate at the Mesa location 4/3/12 based on Yelp reviews. Very festive atmosphere. I had the Carne Asada, my wife had the Pollo Asada, my son the make your own tacos. All were great, as well as the margaritas.I've frequented this nicely appointed restaurant inside the Wynn twice this year and both times have come away from it satisified and definitely full.  The first thing I noticed when walking in were the hosts.  Nothing less than model-good looks will get you hired there as a hostess, not to mention, there are usually three of them to greet you.  Diversity seems to be important to them also, as there was a UN type group of white, Asian, and black hostesses.

After being seated for the Teppanyaki style dinner, we started off with very smooth sake in one of the coolest design carafes I've seen (the ice fits into the outside of the carafe).  We followed that with Toro Oh (fatty tuna), which was reasonably priced at $24 for 3 pieces.  

Depending on which chef you get that night, they may do some tricks with the onions (onion volcano) or egg (a la Tiger Woods golf trick commercial).  The food is served hot and cooked right in front of you, ready to eat.  We had the NY sirloin, which was very tender and flavorful, and my cousin had the sea bass (which I wouldn't recommend when going to a Teppanyaki style restaurant).  If you can afford the Kobe beef ($85), go for it.  

Overall good meal with great ambiance.  I do have one warning, you and your clothes will smell of smoky, cooked food, even after you leave the restaurant.Located within the Wynn....These dishes were traditional Japanese style bbq, they're small. Don't expect to get that full there, it's like the opposite of buffet style. I got a couple of dishes here and the total bill ran to about $400 (including a big tip), but the only dish that stood out above everything else was the Japanese-imported KOBE BEEF priced at the current market rate of $30 / ounce. I ordered 6 ounces and they brought the beef out to me by the waterfall to allow me to check if everything was perfect. After placing it in my mouth the beef just started to melt, it's like you didn't even have to chew. They also give you 3 sauces to dip the beef in; each one brings out the flavor of the beef in its own way. I defiantly suggest you to adventure out and get a couple of ounces of this. Why you might ask? Because you're in Vegas!

     The service was also very good; my waiter even took me and my date in the back near the 70 ft. waterfall and took our picture for us. There was a private area for dining and private party's right under the waterfall. There was a dining table directly on the man-made lake where the waterfall was falling into. It was very beautiful, one of the nicest places in Vegas, hands down.

The hotel room wasn't bad either!first time eating spanish food and tapas!  some good stuff here!  i suggest skipping the entrees and just order a bunch of tapas, especially  if you have a larger party.  you'll get a good sampling of a lot of dishes like it's dim sum, lol.  make sure to also order a pitcher of sangria!The Greene House is a very solid restaurant.  We both thoroughly enjoyed the experience and the meal.

We both liked the decor and ambiance, and eating outside in the Winter was great, as we're from Chicago, though the heaters were a bit too intense at times (they cycled on and off fairly frequently).

The service was excellent; our server was very friendly and attentive and offered advice when I had trouble deciding between 3 entrees.

The food was very good, overall.  The spinach artichoke dip appetizer was very tasty, though nothing truly unique.  My scallops were good, though I felt like the bacon strips were gratuitous and made the dish feel cheaper than it actually was.  Her turkey sandwich with pesto on their grilled pita bread was the real standout: interesting and flavorful, with just the right amount of kick.  I'm rarely jealous of what others order at restaurants, but in this case I certainly was.

If and when I ever return to the Phoenix/Scottsdale area, I certainly wouldn't mind returning to the Greene House.Delicious fish & chips served in a cheerful cafe atmosphere by pleasant waitstaff made for a lovely lunch. Worth the wait and parking challenges.Staying at the Phoenician, you're just staring at it constantly, teasing you.  Well, I decided to get at it and parked forever away from the full parking lot.  That extra half-mile was brutal in the heat. At which point I'm like, s&*t, I'm only at the trailhead?!  Lots of boulders, sweating, a fun scramble up the handpole region, and bam!  Top of the mountain, looking around.  At which point, I see my resort, hell I may just see my very room.  But....I have to turn around, drag my ass down the mountain and huff it to the car which is about 500 degrees when I get it in.

Still, totally worth it, and really awesome memory from my Scottsdale trip.Hands down, best gluten-free pizza in my 6 years of gluten free.I'm glad I found Cibo while visiting Phoenix! My co-worker and I went on a Wednesday evening around 6 and had no wait/crowd. I love that their happy hour runs until 7. We had wine and the meatballs (fabulous!). Then had dessert before dinner with the fried dough balls that we dipped in Nutella. Loved it! For dinner we shared the Prosciutto pizza and the Diavalo pizza and both were fantastic! It's is cute little rustic place with a beautiful patio. It'll be a regular stop on my trips to Phoenix!My brother in law is a huge Jimmy Buffet fan so we had to go, we had the nachos for a starter which were huge and the fish tacos as our main, very tasty, the drinks were strong and really hit the spot and the service was excellent, my sister got a monkey balloon hat which she was very pleased about, be prepared for a wait no matter what time you go, it gets really packed.From the outside this looks unassuming. However, once inside it opens up to a large restaurant room. The service was excellent. The food was good but couldn't quite decide if it wanted to be French or Italian. That comment aside, the food was very good. We chose the prix fix menu and found it quite good. Overall, We enjoyed a quiet (for Las Vegas) enjoyable meal.I ate here twice during a recent trip to Vegas. The first time, our group popped in for some quick late night nibbles. We sat in the bar/lounge area since the main dining room was closed. I have to say, the food was excellent (had the hummus, a yummy cheeseburger and the fish and chips to share among the group) but the service was TERRIBLE. Our server neglected us most of the night, everything took FOREVER to get to our table (and they weren't busy), and to top it all off, the to-go order we placed for a friend too ill to come to dinner was obviously never put through to the kitchen. Instead of owning up to that mistake, the server let us sit there for 45 minutes, coming by only occasionally to say they were "working on it." Hmph.

This experience is the reason for the four star rating, because my SECOND experience - on New Year's Eve - was truly a five star experience. We arrived early for our reservation and, sadly, got stuck with the same cocktail server as we waited for our table in the bar area. She was still incompetent and it took forever to get our drinks, but once we moved to our table in the restaurant that entire experience was forgotten. Our dinner service was impeccable, as was the multi-course prix fixe NYE menu. Among the items I sampled: roasted garlic soup with a garnish of fried frog legs (amazing!!); mini blue cheese souffles; Alaskan crab poached in butter with shaved black truffles; grilled sturgeon with a manilla clam chowder broth; grilled pork tenderloin with a honeycrisp apple chutney; and - the BEST of the BEST - grilled bison tenderloin. Heaven on a plate. The bison was so lean, and so perfectly cooked, you barely needed a knife to cut it. Desserts were a sticky pudding and individual chocolate fondue, complete with our own ramekins of melted chocolate and assorted mini cookies, cake bites and fruits for dipping.

Our server was kind enough to create a wine flight to pair with each course. It was the perfect accompaniment to our meal, as was his attention to detail and the overall classy atmosphere. I've eaten in many casinos, but this was the first time I actually felt like I wasn't in one! Aside from the horrible cocktail service, it was an experience I hope to be able to re-live someday.This ain't no Hometown Buffet, yo!

FYI, I am NOT a fan of buffets! When my brother wanted to spend his birthday here out of ALL the other excellent restaurants in Vegas, I wanted to say, "What?!?! Are you serious?!?! What the heck is wrong with you?!?! Do we really need 3000 calories in one meal???"

But hey, he was paying for our dinner at $36.95/person so I just kept my mouth shut. I'm sure my bratty face showed how I was feeling anyway. While dining here, I realized that the food was much better than most buffets. Actually, it's the best buffet I've been to so far.

Excellent dishes:
Thai Beef Salad
Crab legs
Smoked Salmon
Chicken with some kind of mango salsa
Pepperoni Pizza
And so many more but I can't remember cuz I was in a food coma.

Not so great dishes:
All the sushi rolls - rice was old, dry, tough. Sushi is never good at a buffet. I know this but I was curious, I just wanted to try it.
And some other things but I can't remember cuz I was in a food coma.

Then there's the dessert area....EEEEEEEEEEEEKKK!  It was HEAVEN!!! A crepe station, gelato, cookies, carrot cake, cheescakes, cupcakes, mousse, chocolate-dipped marshmallows, etc. The creme brulee was my favorite! I think I tried almost ALL of them. YAY for sugar!!! I had about 10 desserts on the table in front of me. WOOO!

Service was excellent! I wish I remembered the name of the guy who helped us with drinks and other things cuz he was really patient with the 18 of us. We needed more utensils, napkins, drinks and we changed the seating for the kids, our requests seemed endless but we didn't have to wait long to get them. When my family realized he was Filipino, they were all over him and kept asking him questions: "Where do you live?" "Where's your family?" "How long have you been here?" "Can you take our picture?" "Can you take one more?" "Okay, one more picture?" I felt sorry for the guy but it didn't look like it bothered him at all. He never stopped working or smiling while he was answering a billion questions...and thank you for taking 50 pics of us!

I had so much fun trying so many different things! I'm glad my brother celebrated his birthday here. For a buffet, this is really good!Yum Yum Yum! This place is definitely 5+stats! But the reason why I gave this a 4star was because the lines are SUPER SUPER LONG(2-3hours) but I understand that it's normal. The thing that makes the lines long are that the people do not clean up the tables fast nor efficiently enough. When standing in their long lines, you can even see some tables being left dirty for 30minutes without anyone cleaning up.Pretty solid buffet, I personally rank it number 2, behind wicked spoon in Cosmo.

Solid dessert selection, good grub, google service, and he'll it's the Wynn so it's pretty fancy too.

Crab legs all day everyday, prime rib, etc, but where they really win...the crepe station. Save room for dessert, or just start with dessert and you'll be set.

Grab a candy apple to go and eat it for breakfast when you're hungover from rolling hard 8's all night at the tables.Great atmosphere, fun place. As you'd expect by the name, Tex Tubb's is decked out all Texasy. I like ordering a Shiner Bach on tap, they serve it extra cold! My favorites are the fish tacos and the flautas. I gave it 4 stars because even though they've got some tasty items on the menu, there's some pretty blah ones as well.red 8, ive been my first time about 2 years ago with a group of family and the food was excellent a bit pricey but very good but thats vegas for ya, the beef was mouth melting and most fusion places and chinese places the beef is chewy but not this one i enjoyed every piece and so did my family, they usually have a long wait so get there early an put your name down if you are in vegas you must try!I came here with my in-laws who were visiting from India and were so freakin' tired of pasta, raw vegetables, and cheese.  Oh, America.  I tried to tempt them with Japanese food at Mizumi but raw fish wasn't up their alley, either.  We stumbled across Red 8 and their eyes lit up.  Pan-Asian, it was!

As a vegan, I was absolutely delighted to be dining at a Wynn restaurant, knowing there would absolutely be delicious food for me to eat.  I started with a soy Thai Iced Tea and I nearly lost my mind, it was so good.  I ordered two vegan dim sums, the white lotus and jade dumplings, at the waitress' suggestion.  I don't remember what's actually in them (spinach?  mushrooms?) but they were both fantastic.  For my main, I had the Vegan Tofu Shiitake.  It was okay, but a little boring!  We had some hot chili paste with the dumplings so I liberally spooned that over my food to give it some oomph.  Even boring tofu and mushrooms can still hit the spot, and I left quite full.

My in-laws loved their food and everyone had a great meal.  The prices are exorbitant but nothing worse than any place else in the area.  Next time I'm in the area and craving something similar, I think I'll have to check out Wazuzu.  Similar menu, but more vegan options (including sushi!).FAVORITE: uhm the BLUE MEN!!! DUH!! 

so i would give this show 3.5 stars but i had a GREAT TIME!!! its definitely a great show and very entertaining!!! when we got to the counter to purchase some last minute tickets the guy at the counter knocked off almost thirty percent for the seats in the upper middle!!! 

aside from the fact that it was great a few things disappointed me...the show went by relatively smoothly... however there were parts in the show that were kind of slow and that was weird for me. the blue men was looking for audience members, but it took them a good 10 mins or so to do so 

another thing that was a disappointment was the pain colors they choose to use in their finale...they were pretty dull colors for a show like that i would have hoped that they would use really bright colors like their promo ad shows.Working at Fashion Show Mall, I frequent RA as their Happy Hour is unsurpassed. Great drink and roll specials. One thing I love is they don't get lazy with the simple rolls. Even their California Rolls are deelish. (I only know this from eating off of my friends' plates). Some of the best dishes they have aren't sushi at all. The Tuna Salad is bomb.com. Tuna Sashimi on a bed of greens and an awesome sweet/spicy dressing. I am sure the menu describes it better, but just eat it and be amazed. I recently tried the Lobster Spring Rolls. The roll is crispy and flaky and the lobster is always perfectly prepared. It comes atop what I think is a mango puree AKA mango baby food, but the mix of the lobster, cream cheese and super sweet puree makes for a party on the tongue. A couple tips, Fashion Show Mall employees receive a discount (I think 10% off total not including alcohol) and if you check in on Foursquare and tell your server, you get a free order of edamame or a bowl of miso soup. I also like that the entire staff is aware of their Foursquare specials and don't act jerky when you ask for free things.Upon arriving around 1:30pm, we were seated rather quickly as there was no wait. We sat inside since outside was really hot during the summer time. Has a beautiful view of the pool and as Carol S. said, you are paying for the view. 

Our waiter was very hospitable and attentive, answered all our questions especially letting us know that the portions of the food are on the smaller side. We also liked the decor and even noticed the details of the carpet.

We all ordered the 2 half portion sandwich and 1 side combo for $18, I guess that's a decent price for Vegas standards. Portions are like gourmet truck sizes and the food isn't half bad. We were hungry so I ate everything off my plate. I had a vegetable with hummus and pita bread sandwich, the chicken salad apple sandwich, and a side of chicken noodle soup.We are an owner on this property with Hilton Grand Vacation. We like the program and is a great deal for those people who like to vacation every year. As for this property, it is first rate. The Strip is accessible by the bus "The Deuce"  or a short walk to the monorail. The rooms are very nice, clean and bright, pretty much Hilton standards. We will be back!I went here not expecting much, but I really had a good time. We had bottle service, so we did not have to wait in line and the host were very nice and attentive. For two bottles of Goose we did not pay that much. The only bad thing I have to say about PCL is the weird transitions of the music. The DJ went from Too $hort to Ashlee Simpson. Who does that? But overall I had a great time, and if I am ever in the Scootsdale area again I will definitely be making a stop here.The service and food was excellent!  I was a concierge here in Las Vegas before and have eaten at many fine establishments and I would say that this one is a new addition to the top of my list.  Great classic Italian and a wonderful view of the strip.  We will definitely be returning.This was my very first buffet experience in Las Vegas.  Somehow, through word of mouth, we knew we had to try this place at least once.
We've been back a couple of times since.  One thing I learned, it's a waste for people who don't eat much (in my opinion). 

The buffet is huge - but nothing really stood out.  They have all the usual expected buffet fair - which is good.  There's just so much stuff that I was honestly overwhelmed.  Even if you just took one small sample of everything - it's too much (for me).  Top it off at the meat section where you can select a mouthwatering steak and they cook it to your liking right there.  A full sized steak, on top of all the other buffet pickings?  Whoa.  If I could have stuffed all that into my tummy - I totally would have.Definitely agree with other reviewers that Parasol is a perfect spot for what I'd like to call a "transitional moment"--you know, a time when you find yourself wanting a spot to sit back and enjoy an alcoholic beverage but ultimately have other destinations you want to end up. I definitely can't see myself spending more than an hour or two at this lounge, but it (specifically, the Parasol Down portion) was the perfect place to unwind after dinner at SW and keep the buzz going until the next planned stop (Blush). 

Our cocktail server was really friendly and brought our drinks really quickly. Considering we were in the Wynn, the drinks weren't too overpriced. I believe it was about $80 or so for a round (plus a second for a few people). The seating situation was a little less than ideal for a group of 7; we had to pull up chairs from a bunch of other table and the table was a little too small to comfortably fit everyone's drinks. I also wasn't thrilled with the light level -- if it were a little earlier in the night, I'd be ok with the whole lounge being so brightly lit, but I think they could turn the lights down a notch and give the place a bit more atmosphere. 

Those small complaints aside, I was happy with the time we spent at Parasol. I definitely nominate it for the "Best Place to Stop on Your Way Somewhere Else" award!was a little hesitant with the low ratings i saw but i liked it.  the decor was great!  surprised with the pond and geese with the authentic mexican blankets and tile.  i ordered the meatball soup and liked them both.  the price was reasonable.  would go back.Out of all the Harrah's buffets, from the Buffet of Buffets, this one is the best!  

Waiting time is not as long, so that's actually a big plus.  

It's not the biggest.  Biggest one is either Planet Hollywood's Spice Market or Rio's Carnival World Buffet, however, the taste and quality of food of this one is much better.

The crab legs are of good size and perfectly cooked.  The fruit passion gelato is very yummy.  I also like the Brazilian churrasco.  

There are 2 TVs.  One in the dinning area on the left of the entrance and one is all the down in the back.Came to Vegas for the weekend for the Mayweather/Mosley fight. MGM where I was staying was a mad house. So to get a break from the crowd I walk down the strip to Paris and Planet Hollywood. Im not a buffet person at all. I'd rather go to a nice sit down restaurant. Mass produced food usually isnt as good. But on this trip it just didnt work out that way. So out of the three buffets I went to on my trip I enjoyed Paris the most by far. I liked Italian food there, along with the prime rib. I have to say pretty decent food for guy who doesn't like buffets.Went here for brunch/lunch.  The prime rib was pretty good, crab legs passable. Everything else standard buffet fare. Macaroons also quite delecious. Pretty good overall for the price. Great dessert selection.We went for early dinner - our first meal since arriving in Vegas. We were HUNGRY! Get there early or there will be a big line. We had a groupon, which came with a bottle of wine for 2 people - so it was a great deal! 

Love that they have a station for the different regional cuisines of France, in addition to the cold seafood station and amazing desserts in the middle. Seriously, save room. My friends all said this was the best desserts we had in vegas (the Wynn was up there too!) with macaroon cake pops, little tartlets, cakes, pies...you name it.

But on to the real food - main dishes! First, the crab legs weren't that great, so skip those and save room for everything else. The prime rib was amazing, and so was the pork with the apple cider reduction and baked apples that came in a single-serve skillet. Adorable and so flavorful! The salmon was also very good, as well as the fall vegetable hash with carrots, squash, onions, and a few other things I can't remember. It was great though. If i wasn't allergic to gluten I would've tried the make your own crepes station, which looked divine. I did however try the caramelized bananas by themseves...WOW they were good! They also have a mediterranean station with lots of crudites and sauces that are great for pairing with a lot of the other dishes you can get around the buffet. 

Don't fill up on bread - there's so many other good things to try!!The wife and I ate here while I was in Vegas for a conference.  Through some of the games she played on Facebook, she was able to score us a free bottle of wine from this restaurant, which was the main reason we chose to eat here.  We also used a comp to score $40 off.  This is an Italian joint that's located in the MGM Grand.  We were both a little full from lunch, so we just went with entree's, along with the free bread.  The free bottle of wine we got was pinot grigio.  It was quite good, as evidenced by us finishing off the whole bottle. :)  For dinner my wife ordered the lobster gnocchi, while I had the seafood risotto, which included scallops and shirmp.  Both dishes were very good.  The $40 comp left us with a total bill of about $27, which was quite a deal for this place.  Many of the entree's here are north of $30, but then again, so are the entrees at most all of the nicer restaurants in Vegas.  This place is very contemporary on the inside, and we had a nice spot to people watch.  While the food was very good, I would say the only negative to this place was the service.  We must've waited at least 30 minutes from the time we finished our meal until the time we finally were able to pay our check.  Our waiter was MIA forever trying to correct our bill.  It was frustrating as we were ready to go.  All in all, I thought the food here was good, but I won't go out of my way to come back here.I know a lot people don't like McD's, but this one is actually pretty good.  Every time I have gone there, they get my order correct and pretty good service.  If you have Sun Dollars from ASU you can use them there.  It's cheap food and the parfaits are good for only a buck.  The bathrooms are always clean and they remodeled the inside so it looks really nice.  They even have a waterfall inside.  It's probably the nicest McDonald's in Tempe.Wait. No. Seriously. $5.99 for steak, eggs, toast, and hash from midnight to 8am? IDEAL. Especially ideal since you are probably broke and/or drunk from gambling all night and somehow stumble into this place. Plan on waiting around 20 minutes to get in, and then plan on eating some moderately questionable steak if you are sober, otherwise deliciously unquestionable steak if you have been drinking. Furthermore, its in Bill's Gamblin' Hall & Saloon, so that right there is reason enough. The crowd in the Victorian Room is a great mix of passed out people eating by their sad-sad selves to groups of people coming down from their X-induced dance-fests at some stupid club where they waited 3 hours to get in only to pay $20 a drink after spending the afternoon putting their faces on.It was 1am on Monday morning.  We all had early flights to catch, and we just wanted something cheap and delicious to end another fun trip to Vegas.  Somehow we found ourselves in Bill's Gamblin' Hall because one of our friends could swear they had steak and eggs.  Luckily, they did AND it was only $6.99.  It came with eggs, hash brown, toast, and steak.  Our server (Ervin) was super nice.  Our orders came out just as we wanted them (and we all asked for different ways to cook the eggs and steak).  All-in-all, we left as very happy and full customers!Second time dining here.   Great food.   Great Service.  The place is clean and nice.  Our food was really good,  good portions.   When we got the check the waiter set a plate down with ice cold sweet watermelon.   We will be back!   We are looking forward to their Dim Sum!My family and I have been going to TC's for many many years!  Whenever I think of TC's I think of their eggs benedict.  Whenever I crave a eggs benedict, I think of TC's, its always been amazing, and my favorite.  Also their crab stuffed pastry benedict.Perched in the rooftop sculpture garden of Madison's new arts center, the Overture, Fresco has one of the best views in town.  Warmed by two glasses of red and three good friends, my experience there was pleasant (ifnot also slightly blurred by the syrah). Some fantastic scallops were followed by a fine beef tenderloin.  The sides (potatoes and a seasonal veggie) were a bit bland but nothing offensive.

However, like so many FoodFight locations, Fresco is big on style and not much else. The price tags here don't equal the quality.  Head there to impress a date or out-of-towner with the view but don't expect too much from the meal.Great food and reasonably priced. It's Vegas so everything comes off as plastic-y but the food was great as was the service... hold for the sommelier who was just a pompous ass. Other than that the only downside was the dessert I chose... basically like 5 chocolates on a plate. No bueno.I've eaten at fdl 3 times in the last year and half, eaten at  burger bar 6 times and fdl hq in sf 2 times....over all very good !  
as to fdl in lv - it's the kind of place to enjoy if you want to get away from the hustle and bustle of the vegas scene that is only a few steps away ...although...i gotta admit...my last visit to fdl which was a late seating...our party of 6 could hear some music thumping...not sure which venue nearby was the cause...but it surprised me...i agree with some of the other reviewers that the desserts are not up to par, and my last visit, the service was also lacking ( they explained that they were short staffed...it looked like they were..in return...they did waive the corkage...and gave us a round of drinks too...very nice ! )
highlight included a sea bass dish, the rib eye...very good....SO had a silky smooth, yet generous chunks of lobster in a bisque and of course, the foie gras...gotta have foie gras !!!
and a nice touch - getting the flowers off the wall "art" ...it holds individual flowers that can be removed and given to the patrons...cool...the chicks dig that !!
i got major brownie points with the group when i brought a bottle of wine that was given to me as a gift 6 years before, the sommelier decanted and i asked that he have a glass with us...he gave us a corny review ( hint of black cherry, currant..blah blah blah ) when asked what the bottle cost on their wine list ...he said it would be $800-$900 !!!  are you shittin' me !!!  crazy !!  

i gotta admit...i like fleur de lys and recommend over Aureole if you are looking for a high-end meal at mandalay ...but my fav at mandalay is still BURGER BAR !!I'm a sucker for all things tiny. So I love small plates.  I just like to share and try a whole bunch of little things.  So this place wins me over on concept alone. 

We tried the tuna tacos, skirt steak, nampol messa wings, and artichoke barigoule.  The tuna tacos were good, but a little to big to eat in one bite and a little too messy to not eat in one bite.  They need to be smaller or less crunchy.  

The skirt steak was good, but it came with one tiny fingerling potato that wasn't really shareable.  I don't think there is a potato crisis right now so pony up a few more.  It came with a ton of tomatoes.  

The nampol messa wings were extremely tasty.  Right amount of spice, meat came right off the bone, and the salad they came with was very tangy and crunchy.  A good contrast to the wings.

The artichoke barigoule had issues.  The carrots, artichoke hearts, asparagus, and tomatoes were ok but they just tasted like vegetables.  They hadn't soaked up any of the sauce.  The cheese was excellent but we needed more of it.  And we didn't realize that there were spoons on the table in a little box until after they took the dish away.  It may have been better with spoons to get more of the sauce.  I'm not getting the concept of having a box of spoons on the table anyway.  They give you a fork and knife... why are the spoons self-service?

One of the things I really liked is their flight of cocktails.  The tropical flight was delightful with a Sumo, sparkling peach, and cherry limeade.  The cocktails were large enough to get a good buzz on.  And you get to try three different cocktails!  Pretty good for 18 bucks.

They can make any cocktail with liquid nitrogen for $25.  We didn't go for this.  But we did go for the affogato a la LN2 served tableside for $15.  LN2 stands for liquid nitrogen, by the way.  They mix it right at your table and you get all the smoke and the ooos and ahhs from other tables.  It's a nice touch.  And the dessert is delicious.  I couldn't have much because it has espresso in it, but still very tasty.  Also, the PB&J macaroons with tiny rum shakes are to die for.  

The decor pretty much looks like Fleur de Lys did, at least when you get into the inside dining room.  Feels fancy but then you look at the 300-lb tourist spilling out of his shorts and t-shirt eating with a camera around his neck and think, maybe not. But I'm disappointed that they took out the roses on the wall and just put in tile or something.  I heard the roses were gone and I thought it was because of some major remodel.  But the frame is still there, they just took the roses away.  Don't know why because they were charming and everyone raved about them.

Service was very good, except for the spoon issue.  Could have let a sister know!  I definitely recommend coming here for the meat dishes or dessert.  The one vegetarian dish we tried needs some work but it might have just been a fluke... or our inability to find the spoons.I've eaten here twice, both times I ordered his specialty foie gra which was melt in your mouth delish! 
What I like about this place is it's so quiet, I don't like noisy places, I can enjoy my high end food without all the noise. It's cozy, not really busy, so the waiters are very good about refills and if you have questions. The tables are spaced far apart so there's some privacy too.
I've also had the Filet Mignon, which was very tender and juicy. Cooked medium rare the way I like it!
Also had the Braised Waygu Short ribs, I enjoyed this dish as well. It was very flavorful and seasoned well.
I suggest getting a groupon or something, spend $75 and get $125 worth of high end cuisine.The location is out dated, but the stores are very modern & actually provide a discount. For me, it was well worth it as all the shops I would go to are there like Quicksilver, Zumiez, Pac Sun, Volcom, Hurley, etc.

I could spend all day trying to find deals :) I think it's better then Primm & Barstow.Great prices and quality stuff. I got new work clothes and the always under rated underwear and socks. I got a great haul for about $350. Most of the pants I got were under $20 and the polo shirts the same. Next time I want to go to the high end stores. My friend got some great deals.This mall is huge.  It's been around for almost 20 yrs now and has continued to expand and add stores even through the economic downturn.  We travel to Vegas once a year in December to go to the NFR and do some Christmas shopping. This place is on our list to visit when we do.

The majority of the stores are indoor with a few outdoor stores in the parking lot.  If you plan to shop/browse the entire mall, plan on an all day shopping excursion.  It will take a while to casually go through it all.

If you get hungry, there's a food court in the center of the mall with fast food options or you can dine in some sit-down restaurants in the parking lot.

I've found some great deals at the stores here and if you catch them at the right time you'll the sales/discounts can be huge.  Be prepared for large crowds on the weekends and if you're driving here I recommend parking on the South side of the mall where I've found it to be less busy and easier to park.

Return Factor - 90%Sometimes this place can get a bit too busy for the staff to be fast, but boy is the wait worth it if you're looking for really, really good Huevos Rancheros or corned beef hash! We've been here so many times and I have yet to find a contender for their Huevos Rancheros. My better half swears by their corned beef hash too, so on our collective reviews I recommend both dishes. The staff here is also always pleasant and when given notice can accommodate large groups or special requests perfectly. I haven't personally ate here for anything other than breakfast so I can't give an honest review of their entire menu, but the next time you're in Las Vegas and are in need of a great breakfast give Raffles a shot!So many Carnegie haters!  Really?

I'm an East Coaster living in Northern California.  You want marginal deli food?  We've got it for you, in abundance!  But ah, when I get to Vegas, I know I'm going to have kosher dill pickles and  Carnegie Deli cheesecake.

I could care less about the gargantuan sanwiches or the lobby coffee shop atmosphere.  It doesn't even bother me that the nearest restroom is 10 billion miles away.  What matters is the cheesecake.

The touch decision?  Strawberry or rugalech?  Through my amazing power of persuasion (bullying, perhaps) I manage to convince my travel companion to order the other.

SO SO SO SO SO SO GOOD.  Cheesecake heaven.  Seriously.

This is the only time I *EVER* order milk, anywhere.

It's a simple equation, really.  Water and pickles, milk and cheesecake.Carnegie's is located at the Mirage, near the Sportsbook. 

The front of the menu reads: "Home of the best pastrami and corned beef in town and blitntzes too!"  This may be, but at $17.99 a sandwich it's a hard to swallow the price even for Vegas.

What to do in this dilemma? SHARE a sandwich, ask for water, and take your order to go.  

Me and my boyfriend shared the corned beef sandwich since we're both not fans of pastrami. Trust when I say, it'll be more than enough: the sandwiches are HUGE. Since the prices on sodas and bottled drinks, including bottled water, were also ridic we ordered regular water. The water cups were given in a normal sized drinking cup with a lid as opposed to the mini sized water cups I abhor. We avoided dining in since the place was packed and opted to take our order to and sit at Sportsbook. I was very pleased that we only ended up paying for the sandwich.

Overall the corned beef was good.  They're very generous with the meat, I had to take apart my half of the sandwich and remove some of the meat just to get the sandwich in my mouth. The sandwich was spot on: the corned beef was very flavorful and tender combined with the tangy mustard we asked for on the side. 

Would I have it again? Yes, but only if I share it with someone!Yum! You know you're in trouble when you get hungry and immediately log on to yelp to find out where you are going to eat. But you haven't done me wrong yelp, in recommending Pita Jungle. 

Today I had a lunch of baba ghanoush and the pita pizza. There was plenty of BG left for me to take home, but the pizza was gone in almost an instant. Let's not debate this in the classic Chicago vs New York style, this is a pita with pizza toppings on it, not brain surgery. But the ingredients were what made the meal. FRESH. the spinach was not previously frozen, the tomatoes were firm and juicy, the mushrooms were not out of a can! there was a touch of feta, and just the right pizza spices. 

It was small, pita bread small, but that's cool, just because I want to eat like a pig doesn't mean I should...all of the assorted staff who approached me were friendly and the service was quick. I will be back for falafel, for pesto pizza, for the macro platter and a couple of the other sandwiches that looked good.First visit and I was not sure what to expect.  Was not to sure what this whole dim sum thing was about only that it was small portions that came to you on carts and you just picked what you wanted. Went with 2 girlfriends from school and we were hungry. We ended up getting 9 plates to share. It did not seem like a lot of food because everything came in 3s. Three small potstickers, three small pork balls, three small this, and that. Well we were so wrong.    After eating all the different things we had to be rolled out of there. 

Place was good, only problem is you don't know how much things cost when they are wheeling them around. They ask if you want it, you say yes, they give it to you then they take a stamp and place it on A,B,C etc.  at the end they take your ticket and bring you back your bill with the price. Everything in Chinese except the dollar amount. 

I would go back and give it another try. Like I said food was good. It was kept hog and fresh.Afternoon tea in the Four Season Hotel, Monday-Thursday 3-5pm.  Scones with devonshire cream, strawberry preserves and lemon curd.  The scones are small, silver dollar sized and so flaky and you can ask for more.  The wait staff's attention to detail is very good, I wore black slacks, they gave me a black linen napkin instead of the usual white, so there wouldn't be lint on my pants.  
4 different  tea sandwiches and 4 different desserts on a tiered 
serving dish.  Each person gets their own choice of tea.  Around $30. 
Beautiful atmosphere in the Verandah, both dining inside and out, next to the pool.  Downstairs from the main lobby.
Four Seasons hotel is attached to the Mandalay Bay HotelFor $16 dollars, walk into a world of sunken temples and pirate ships inside the Mandalay.
The creators of this awesome aquarium got it right when they created the humid and tropical climate of the jungles of the Amazon.  Upon one's first steps into the exhibit, one is enveloped in a humid warmth, and the sound of jungle life fools the senses. Here a unique assortment of species such as the rare golden alligator, the water monitor, and the arapaima gigas (fish that can grow to 14ft) can be viewed through glass displays.  Often, one can virtually be right next to them and see them up close, through the glass.
Once you have passed the tank of ravenous piranhas, the aquarium's glass walls rise at least 15 feet, and within its enclosures one can see a wowing display of ocean life.  Tropical fish such as large, friendly-looking puffers, angel fish, multi-colored tang, and graceful sting-rays provide an entertaining display.
The second room in the aquarium is my favorite, as there is a touch pool where people can get up close and personal with some of the marine life.  Tiny rays, sharks, and horse shoe crabs move about in the shallow pool, and you can reach into the water and "pet" them.  In addition, I love to watch the jellyfish floating about in an etheral lavender light, looking almost like silk blown about by breezes.
The final room of the habitat is the Shark Reef.  a unique aquarium that makes the visitor feel as though they are deep sea diving, and have come upon a shipwreck with sunken treasure aboard.  One is surrounded by glass, and a plethora of underwater sea life.  Nurse sharks, sand sharks, large rays and seat turtles, residing in a world of sand and coral, float around and above you.  In the glass tunnel, one can get an incredible up-close view of the sharks.I love aquariums and this one did not disappoint. It probably helped that I had relatively low expectations of an aquarium inside a casino (only in Vegas!). 

It turned out to be bigger than I thought. It took us about 2 hours to go through the aquarium with the free audio guide. My favorites:

-Komodo Dragon: Such amazing creatures.
-Golden Alligator: Nice surprise right at the entrance. He moved around quite a bit when we were there and opened his mouth.  
-Green Sea Turtles: Large & majestic.
-Sharks: Obviously. ;) So many varieties I couldn't keep track. 

The line at the beginning was annoying. It was even more irritating when we found out it was because of the touristy prom pictures they make you take before you go inside. They seriously made us pose like we were at prom.

Overall, it's a refreshingly nice getaway from the usual Vegas strip scene. Especially fun for families with kids.Great service, Great food, Great Price.

I had a large group of people with me and the staff were attentive in all of our needs. We were seated in 10 mins, drinks came out immediately, food came out in about 25 mins.  Portions were decent, worth the price.  Not a lot of 24hour cafe's have good service like this so I would come here again if I stayed close to the Luxor.My previous review was written over a year ago, and Goodwill has shown some major improvements since then. In fact, I have now re-added Goodwill back to my shopping radar, having purchased a vintage floral dress from the W. Cheyenne location for a mere $3. My favorite Goodwill locations are the S. Eastern and the Sahara at Torrey Pines locations. The organization and merchandising has gotten so much better and I am now a fan.FUN times.  Free porn (what?!)  Hot mixes.  Definitely had a good time the oh... two times we came here on my five day trip to LV.  

Get on their text message list to get some discount goodies/free cover/free drinks.  Text KRAVE to 313131.  Only downside - I have no idea how to get off of that list - I'm back home in NY and just keep getting texts from Krave.  Oops.

UPDATE: apparently you just reply STOP KRAVE to the text message.  It works!This place is loud, obnoxious, and always crowded but that's good for us. We have two toddlers (who we try to teach good manners to) so if one has a meltdown it's not a big deal in this loud restaurant. They will bring out a free basket of fries and have balloons which keeps the kids happy. Sometimes you need a place for kids but you don't want to sacrifice the food. Red Robin is perfect for this! Their milkshakes, burgers, and salads are ALL extremely tastey. Their kids items are big enough for my girls to comfortably share as well. Highly reccomended for loud families!!

Also the service has never been bad but hasn't been awesome either. We keep going back for the food though. Yum!Sadly, I missed out on the late night happy hour.  Here is what I tried though:

Grilled Quail (Caraway and Black Pepper Rub, Lemon Puree, Arugula and Radish -$20): The quail itself was light, tender and perfectly accented with a hint of acidity from the lemon puree and minor spice notes from the caraway and black pepper rub.  Initially, we were just going to drink, but this dish convinced us otherwise.

Wood Grilled Sausages ($13): There are quite a few different types of meat present in this dish (I believe both bison and rabbit were included), and each of the spicy sausage slices is drained in a delectably heavy white cream sauce.  

Scottish Salmon Tartare (Beet, Horseradish, Pita - $18): Scotch egg covered tartare served with thin slices of slightly warm pita.  Use the beets and horseradish to make yourself delicious tartare sandwiches.  

Salmon Creek Pork Belly (Duck Fat Potatoes, Truffle Puree Frisee and Apple Salad -$35): The belly has nice tenderness and was not overdone (as it is at most restaurants that place it on the menu).  Still, it wasn't as light and fatty as some places where I have tried this dish.  The complementing flavors were fine but not extraordinarily memorable.

 I finished it off with a couple of the house's version of the Sazerac cocktail (easily the best one I found in the MGM Grand).  These cocktails were made appropriately with just a small hint of simple syrup and the correct notes of absinthe.  

In closing, NobHill certainly has quite a bit to offer.  As it is, I think I'd like to go again to try that lobster pot pie and a number of other appetizers.  Strongly recommended if you are eating within the MGM Grand.On our recent trip here I decided to try the Southern Fried Chicken. It was very juicy and extremely tasty. The chicken was also boneless which made it very easy to eat. The chicken was also skinless but still had their own "skin" on it with their seasonings. Very tasty indeed! It came with a side of white gravy which was perfect to drizzle on top or dunk in each bite. The piece of chicken was quite large so I definitely have left overs. I again had to have the side of their mac n cheese as it's so yummy.Bobby Q's has excellent barbeque with a great atmosphere, service, and happy hour specials.  I went with a large party (18) co-workers from all over the country and everyone was extremely satisfied with their selections. The ribs and slow cooked brisket and pork were delicious and the selection excellent.  Their desserts were delectable as well (I had the chocolate cake).Ok, I came accross yelp because I was looking for reviews on Brazilian churascurrias. So I picked this one over the one in Scottsdale based on what i read here. 

Happy to say I wasn't dissappointed! We did the all-you-can-eat buffet plus meats for lunch for 18 bucks. Well, the buffet was nice. Full of fresh, tasty and interesting dishes. And then there's the meat.....delicious, juicy, perfectly cooked and it just keeps coming. 

Its a meat lovers paradise, where the servers are continually walking round with freshly bbq'd meats and they slice you endless slivers of the stuff right at your table. 

I was specfically looking for a place like this as I had been to a few in Rio and it was one of my favourite types of food in South America. If I were to compare to the genuine article, I'd say they're no too far off. The places in Brazil probably had more selection but then again i think there may be more selection of meats there at night. I think it may be a little more busy at night too which would help pick up the atmosphere. 

Anyway, I stuffed down as much as I possibly could and was happy with the friendly and fast service. thumps up!Very cool, spacious dining room decked out in black and red. Friendly servers, although a little slow. Delicious food - the chips are fresh and warm, and the three different salsas are all amazing; the grilled peach salad was more like canned peach salad, but still was light, tasty, and refreshing on a hot summer day; and the jumbo grilled burrito...wow! There are so many good authentic Mexican places in this area, but this burrito would probably top them all! The passion fruit slaw and masa-thing on the side were equally wonderful...so much flavor! Like its siblings Fez and Switch, Ticoz offers terrific food in a hip but casual atmosphere perfect for a work lunch or night out.A very nice surprise.  Looks like nothing, tastes good.  Cheap, simple, fast and open late.My friend and I were on a 'budget' trip to Vegas (EG: not looking to splurge over $200 per person on dinner) and after some yelp research on his part, we decided to mosey on over here for a nice steak dinner. 

We didn't have rezzies and yet they sat us by the floor-to-ceiling wall of windows with a spectacular view of the strip. BALLIN'. 

Service was up-to-par and timely. When it came time to inquire about wines, I always like to ask for suggestions and almost without fail, servers will upsell and recommend the two highest priced wines. Initially I decided to pass on the wine as I already was struggling with a (really stiff!) Manhattan but after a couple bites of my steak, I waved another server down (ours was clearly occupied with the next table which had a party of 6, so I didn't want to interrupt her with my inability to make decisions the first go around) who asked if I liked Malbecs. "ABSOLUTELY". It was priced well, he mentioned it was one of his favourites and since it was not the most pricey wine on the list, I trusted his recommendation. It was a fabulous pairing. 

We ordered french onion soup (cheesy goodness) which had a nice depth of flavour and wasn't overly salty, the lobster bisque special (this went really well with the Manhattans, strangely), and both of us had filet mignon with mine medium-rare. 

Great, well-rounded experience.I seriously don't get why this place has such low ratings.  We had the champagne brunch, it was our first meal in Vegas with a best for last mentality and it turned out to be the best meal we had during our 5 day trip.  It beat out Craving at the Mirage and our fancy Mon Ami Gabi anniversary dinner.  Of course the atmosphere is pretty boring but as long as you have good company who cares.  The food I choose to eat was good.  My husband who has completely different food tastes than mine choose what he would enjoy the most and also agreed it was the best meal out of all that we ate on our trip.Love this place.Service was attentive, without being over bearing
Elegant decor, including huge glass panels letting you see right in to the stream-lined kitchen.  
Note-worthy presentation; especially with the appetizers
So much choice (Italian, Asian, American, Indian) that I think some dishes fall flat- the tuna tar tar app was a bit bland. And, though the spare rib was tasty and well cooked, the sauce was overwhelmingly sweet. 
Huge portions- I ate way, way too much- you'll find value even though the prices range form about 25-35 per entree. 
They do have delicious "condiments" to put on your bread, but they didn't explain what they were thoroughly and I ended up dousing a piece of bread with soy sauce! Overall, I would return, but with so many places in this town, I many never make it back!First time visiting and it would probably fall between 3.5-4.

Came with the fellas and we all enjoyed the food.  We had two of the seafood platter.  Good stuff but very over-priced for what you get.  But hey, this is Vegas, it's the Bellagio, and it's a place with trendy decor.

None of us had drinks as we were planning on getting drunk elsewhere. 

After the starter, we had dinner.  Most of us ordered the rib eye which was very good.  Someone had the braised short rib and said it was very good as well.  We ordered all the side dishes to try.

-Potato croquettes were good.
-deep fried/tempura asparagus...good.
-another green dish, wasn't memorable because i can't even remember what it was.
-fried rice....good

great service, great atmosphere.Dim Sum restaurant hidden @ Gold Coast.  If you are craving good dim sum Pin Pang Pong is the place to go.  They have a mediorcre selection of dim sum, probably more on the weekends.  The wait isn't too bad, but if they can have a greater selection of dim sum it would be better.I've been going to Unique since I was little.... when it was called Chic n' Cheap. I always find at least one decent thing at Unique. Granted it doesn't have tons of great stuff, but it is a great stop on a shopping day. And this isnt a psudeo thrift store that more of a vintage store and therefore can charge non-thrift prices. I'm talking shirts under a dollar. yeah.Last night went to Sassi to take advantage of the start of Arizona Restaurant Week. This was my second visit to Sassi. Had been there once before a few years ago. The menu has changed from several years ago, for the better. We had four in our party and started off with the Antipasti for four. They offer it for two or four people. Excellent quality of meats, cheeses, roasted vegetables, olives, caponata, broccoli rabe, beans. They offered $29.00 bottles of wine to go with the $29.00 restaurant week specials. We had two bottles of the Cabernet/Sangiovese blend #501 on the menu. Excellent.  Each of the members in our party ordered restaurant week specials. Roasted butternut squash soup was phenomenal. Sole and Pork Chop were outstanding. Chocolate dessert was the best choice from the selection. The restaurant is a multimillion dollar Tuscan villa set in the desert of North Scottsdale. Just a beautiful place and experience all the way around. Service was superb.I love to hike Piestewa (formerly known as Squaw) Peak, obviously not for the solitude - since it's so crowded.  

It's a rigorous 2.4 (round-trip) mile hike and NOT for beginners.  But it is the most fun. 

It reminds me of our version of the New York street scene - almost egalitarian in a way.  You see people of all sizes, ages, ethnicities, physical abilities, socioeconomic levels, families, friends, lovers, first-dates.  This is where you see Phoenix's diversity, ladies and gentlemen.

It's definitely a wonderful first impression of Phoenix -- from the cross-section of society to the people-watching, and last but not least, the AMAZING breathtaking views, of wildlife (like roadrunners, chipmunks, and lizards), flora and the Valley below.

It's been noted as one of the most hiked trail in in the nation.Went on Wednesday and had the , Beef it up Wednesday Brisket platter . It was the BOMB! awesome !!!! The baked beans were spicy delicious and I can't say enough about the corn bread except order a dozen when you check out and you won't regret it!In my ongoing quest to find delectable food for lunch near my place of work down town, I've come across this gem.  This place makes me feel extra manly with both the selection and the serving size of the food you get.  I keep telling myself that I shouldn't eat everything served on my plate, but I just can't help it at Triple George, it's too darn good.  

First off, parking is limited as it usually is downtown, usually it hasn't been an issue for us though since we just always manage to find a spot or two open at lunchtime.  Once you go inside, there's a certain elegance to the place that gives you the feeling of being a big shot.  I love the tables in closed off sections to the side that make you feel like the part of the restaurant is reserved for you, it only contributes to making my head bigger.  

Second, the one thing that must absolutely be commended about Triple George is the service.  I love, LOVE, the service here.  Everybody from the hostess to the bus boys, to the waiters are incredibly professional and friendly.  No matter how busy the place seems it always feels like I am their number one priority.  They are more than ready to accommodate any request or answer any question I might have and always with a genuine positive attitude.  

Finally and of course most importantly, the food.  The first time I came here I ordered meat loaf wrapped in bacon.  So that gives you the idea of the heartiness of the food that you'll find here.  It was juicy and delicious just as you would expect too.  I've also had the steak sandwich and while I wasn't as big a fan of the combo (I was too lazy to cut off the fat on the steak when it's already in a sandwich), I really did enjoy the chipotle mayo that came with it and again was more than satisfied especially when it actually came medium-rare like I ordered.  

So in short, it's definitely good spot to stop by for lunch if you're downtown with surprisingly affordable options as well.  One day I'll have to stop by for dinner and see if I feel any different about the place, but I doubt it.This place is an awesome venue! I've been here twice, 1st for Bon Jovi and 2nd for Denis Leary's Rescue Me Comedy Tour. Now the artists were the draw, of course, but The Joint and its staff truly ROCK!! Went to see Denis Leary 06-12-10 and he did NOT disappoint! He had his band and some other actors from the show and their own comedy shows. Lenny Claerke, Adam Farara . . . great! the band . . . WAY cool!

Husband played at a blackjack table for the 2 1/2 hours and left almost $600 up . .  that doesn't suck! I took 2 of my girls and one's boyfriend to the show, totally great that there's no age restriction, they all loved it there too! If you get the chance see an event here, you will NOT be sorry!Yes, I overate. Doesn't everybody? Isn't that the point? 

Yes, some of the other "better" buffets around town have crab legs and/or sushi and/or a few of the other dishes. But this is the only place I know where you can literally sample everything seafood-wise you've ever heard of (just about). Wanna know if you prefer crab to lobster? This is the place for that side-by-side taste test you've been dreaming of.

YES!! They had fried clams - something almost impossible to find in LA or Vegas. 

Yes to say Yes!I have been craving some Mexican food, and since it's been a while that I had a good sh%*. I stopped here and order a carne asada burrito with rice and beans. They serve a lot of food and it was very cheap. After eating half of the burrito I was able to fix my back up issue. Boy I was happy, after I got done eating. Next time I will try the carne asada nachos.Wildfish delivered on an extremely happy 'happy hour' tonight to this girl...

The Wildfish chopped salad may be a new favorite - it has huge chilled fresh shrimp, heart of palm, tomato, avocado, bleu cheese, and walnuts - a light meal in itself!  Add a few of the .75 cent oysters, a glass of wine, a side of veggies or a bite of crabcake + some attentive service, and you're in for a real treat!

I'm not sure why I'm not more of a frequent Wildfish visitor... I look forward to another visit soon.  Happy hour is the way to go!Hash House A GoGo is a must go to when coming to Vegas for food.  It is a refreshing alternative to the glut of cheap buffets and overly priced epicurean restaurants.  The portion sizes are humongous as well as having a different twist on homestyle foods.  

The sage fried chicken with waffles is always a sure winner.  Fried chkn is always fresh and crisp and the waffles have bacon right int them.  Pour syrup over the whole thing and you come out a winner, unlike the casinos.

Their meatloaf is your standard classic meatloaf, but without any of the cheap meat taste.  The only thing that I didn't care for much in their meatloaf sandwich was the use of canned tomatoes on top.  It gave a very unrefined feel to the whole thing and clashed with the butter toasted milk bread and smoky cheese.

The banana brown sugar pancakes are worth waking up for even if it means you are still hung over.  The pancakes have nice amount of banana in it and are cooked with brown sugar so you get the marvelous crunchy texture with the well-rounded sweetness.  

The eggs benedict dishes and hash dishes are piled on high and probably enough for two to share or have another meal out of later.  The kiwi-watermelon lemonade is also a feast for the eyes as it layers into 3 different colors and was the star attraction of our table.  

Of course, no one is perfect and we had experienced what many of the other Yelpers had brought up.  Service was really mediocre, and they really did not seem to care.  Our food took over 45 min from the time we ordered and our server said she would get us refills, but would charge us for them.  Great way to comp your customers!  When the food did finally come out, it was one dish at a time at 5 min intervals.  They also messed up our orders.

I think that if you anticipate mediocre service, you should be ok.  Go for the food!So much food, so good too.  All you need to get is the brown sugar banana pancake.  Everything else on the menu is real good but this is on a hole other levelVery busy here even though it's off the Las Vegas strip.  We came here one weekend to check this place out and this place did not disappoint.

The wait was long (~40 mins), but worth it.  

I got Andy's Sage Fried Chicken which came with mashed potatoes, bacon, spinach, mozzarella, and scrambled eggs with biscuit.  This entree is so big that they stabbed a steak knife in the middle of it!

My first bite of this monstrous entree was filled with the juicy taste of the chicken, coupled with the semi creamy texture of the mashed potatoes.  The bacon and the biscuit gave it that breakfast flair.  They sprinkled some spicy sauce around the plate and it added the right punch to the dish.

We also got the pancakes and waffles.  These were your typical pancakes and waffles, albeit in a larger serving size.

Overall, you will be FULL after dining here.  For some, it's a great way to start a day.  For others, it's a great way to end a long night in Vegas.Good food and huge portions I would give 5 stars if they didn't put bacon in everything (goy vay!) I always get the apple pancakes and they are so good!Pretty nice casino!! It's really clean and looks like one of the new casino on the Las Vegas strip!!!

The 4 stars review is for the casino floor only!!!Not my first time staying here, but it has been awhile.

The only reason for my trip was because I got an offer from Boyd for 3 nights stay comp'd. Heck Im not gonna turn that down. This hotel is in the downtown area - so its not you're glitzy fancy place. If you want that you can stay on the strip for 6X the amount you would pay here. This is your basic hotel - no frills. Not even wifi in the rooms. 

Rooms are ok - decor is dated....but it is in downtown. Dealers are really friendly here, they even taught me a couple of new games. 

Considering the only time you are in the room, is when you sleep - this place is a killer deal.Great bar. Awesome happy hour, food, beer, and prices. The place is rarely crowded and a great place to watch a game. A locals paradise. The Mango Hef they make for summer is the greatest beer on Earth!!After reading many so-so reviews, we decided to just for for it and hoped for the best. Maybe we got lucky, but it was pretty good! The service was terrible, but the food was delicious so for us it evened out. My husband and I shared a burger with fries and  the nachos (off the appetizer menu) and he also had a beer, which might have been bigger (like many have said!) if they had more than just bottles. We found that we needed more sour cream with the nachos and our waiter didn't come around until we were pretty much finished with our meal. So, bottom line: go, and ask for and extras when you order so you don't go without them.I have been hanging out by the pool for years!!!  I love the remodeled area and the lights in the bottom of the pool. You have to go to the rooftop bar to get a great view of the lights.  Also, the Olympic size hot tub is an added bonus.  The poolside beds are great for laying on while reading a book or just listening to the music which is also played underwater in the pool.

I have eaten at the restaurant a number of times and would definately suggest Gallo Blanco for dinner even if you aren't staying in the hotel.  I haven't stayed in the rooms.I would have to completely disagree with the other reviewer in regards to the panang.  I absolutely love it!  My husband and I get take out from there at least every two weeks.  He has tried every noodle dish on the menu, but keeps coming back to the Chicken Pad Thai.  I find the vegetable panang to be very authentic, and sometimes it is spicier than other times - but I always love it.  I agree that the decor is an interesting mix and that the restaurant is more Asian blend that straight Thai - but for it's convenient location and decent prices, as well as fantastic panang, we return time after time.Great oysters. The beers went great with the chowders and gumbo. The ambience is a zero but the food is good.Great Italian food and cute atmosphere! Being from the east coast, I am constantly on the hunt for good authentic Italian food. It can be hard to come by and I was thrilled when my husband and I found this great little restaurant. I love the food, the live music nights and the cozy feel. The owners are truly from Italy and they even award a lucky couple each year with a guided tour to Italy by them!  I'm always on the hunt for unique restaurants and this is one of my favorites!I went here this past saturday morning and it *almost* lived up to expectations. The BF and I ordered double lattes, which were very tasty, but tiny considering they cost 4$. He got a french almond croissant, which was not as light, flaky, and delicious as I expected from reviews... but it was good. I got a caramel macaron which was delicious... the caramel filling melted in my mouth and was super tasty. The real problem was that I ordered an egg sandwich and we waited a good 30 minutes for it... for real? it is a fried egg on toast with a slice of cheese..... That was pretty crappy, however, the sandwich itself was delicious! Not quite worth the wait.... but enough to make me not incredimad about waiting so long. I would come back, but I would definitely consider the ridiculous wait time before I ordered another hot meal.Located on south side of Thomas and 5th Av. Across from the hospital.  A not so typical cafe featuring typical, and not so typical cafe eats.  For instance Chile and a  Grilled Cheese Sandwich.  Or  Eggs Benedict, or Spinach Salad with red onions and bacon.  David Charns, the owner is friendly and conscious of quality food.  Open early for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  You can feel well protected with our Boys in Blue frequenting the joint.  For intermittent entertainment, a one man band is sometimes featured on Friday evenings.  Cocktails available.  And if you're interested in checking out First Fridays Art Walk in downtown Phoenix, featured once a month - they're on the bus route.  Super casual atmosphere, good food served up quick with a little smak makes this place fetching.  Be sure to say "Hi" to the dishy blonde at the front door and check out the outfit of the day!This is our weekly breakfast spot - after trying many others we found no match.
The food is served by an amazing staff, drinks are kept topped off and the food is consistent.
The chorizo and eggs crepes are delicious!Like his spotted brother - "he kick's ass" - great food, awesome atmosphere.  Don' t miss the guac and the nachos.  I'd get on the back of this "ass" anytime.Good food and good service. Get the enchiladas!Bayside Buffet's food seems better since the recent remodel. I wouldn't have given them more than three stars, if that, a couple of years ago, but they have definitely stepped things up in an apparent attempt to live up to the flash of those colored lights and automated kiosks out front. They do eggs/omelets very well, and the meat selection is good. Lots of crab legs. Desserts are hidden on the far side of the dining room, but they are worth the walk. Like most buffets in Las Vegas, they can occasionally leave foods out too long - they either continue to cook in the trays and get too hard or they don't get enough heat and get cold. It's a juggling act for the staff.  The dining room is tropical and nicely decorated.

Bayside is far better than the wretched MGM Grand buffet - within the MGM family it is on a par with the offerings at Mirage and Treasure Island, and a notch or two below Bellagio.Excellent salad with filet.  Great shrimp cocktail.  Tasty wine and mixed drinks.  Awesome berries and cream for dessert.  Classy joint, just like all Flemings restaurants.  According to our server, they were unexpectedly busy for that day of the week and he was overly apologetic for slower than usual service and comped our beverage.  This is what makes a great restaurant.My little taste of a famous New York Italian ristorante in Sin City! I'be become a regular. Thanks Robert and Mike for excellent service!Wow, if there's one advantage to the over-the-top, gaudy nature of Vegas, it's in their spas (or at least this one)!  I could not think of a better way to spend the last day of my vacation than here in this huge, themed spa.  It was easy making reservations, and when we got there, the staff waited on us hand and foot.  Baggage was checked in at the bell desk in the lobby, and  once we got to the spa in the Augustus tower, we were immediately given a tour of the facilities.  

The tea room was a great place to relax and sip the chamomile (?) iced tea  and snack on the fruit/pretzels.  The steam room was spacious, but I didn't care too much for the sauna because it felt exactly like being outside in the Vegas heat.  Could have also done without the Arctic Ice Room.  However, the Roman Baths were fabulous.  The water is supposely mineral-enriched, and whether that's true or not, my skin definitely felt softer after I dried off.  There are these amazing heated stone lounge chairs (I believe they call them chaises) located next to the Roman Baths that do wonders for sore muscles.  There was no better remedy for my calves than lying on a thermal stone chaise, particularly after nights of dancing in high heels.  

My Classic Massage was with Sarah, who was a very nice, chatty masseuse.  Her technique was great, but she didn't focus on my knots as much as I liked.  Or...maybe I didn't have any knots left after a few hours of sleeping on that thermal stone chaise.  Either way, though, who cares as long as I left feeling that wonderful?!

P.S.  Patrons who pay for a spa service get complimentary access to the gym.  Yay for working off some of those calories from all the fine dining and drinking!My first time at Ethiopian cuisine after numerous failed attempts at getting someone to go with...I've been working on this for years but timing never worked out. Or maybe I just wasn't dating the right people or something ;)

So! after an attempt at a Chinese place that we found out was closed Sunday, here we were. The service was very relaxed so be ready for some people watching and good conversation.

We ordered the sambusa-puff pastry filled with lentils and vegetables-for an appetizer. One per person is more than enough they are very filling.

We also ordered the fish goulash and a deep fried beef dish with onions. I was nervous about the fish goulash for some reason, and of course as soon as I tried it I wondered why. It's a white fish chopped with vegetables in a delicious red sauce. The bread underneath soaked it all up!
The beef was good and something to order if you don't want any sort of sauce, but to be honest I will not order it again, just because I really enjoyed the sauce from the other dish together with the bread.
There was so much food for the two of us, we did take some home and eat it the next day. Everything was just as delicious. And so cheap! With a couple sodas, our appetizers, and all that glorious food coming out to about 25 bucks, I will be back for more! And often!I know, there's something to be said about the  irony of a tourist going all the way to Las Vegas to eat a an off-strip chain restaurant.

This place is a locals restaurant  that's a bit of a drive from the "strip;" so you won't likely be among the tourist crowd here.

The food and service are outstanding. The acoustics (odd thing to mention, I know) are nice, too, as the noise washes over the room, drowning out conversation specifics from other tables, without causing you to raise your voice to talk to those at your own table. Manages to create an air of public privacy.

Depending on how long you're in Las Vegas, if visiting, if you want to get away from the casinos and have a quiet dinner with spouse, business associates, etc, then Fleming's is the place I recommend.

Note: not much of an after-hours bar, however. Seems more of a dinner time and early post-prandial drinks type of place.No corking fee is the best part of this place. Calamari is great and you can't go wrong with any of the steaks. Last time we went I got the seared scallops, which were amazing. The bar is well stocked, always crowded, which can be a pain sometimes and make it difficult to get to the bar and order drinks but the wait is never long enough to bother me. The service is superior to anyplace we've ever been. The music they play isn't what you'd expect (Frank Sinatra) but rather new pop type music (Rob Thomas).Here's what is great about T-Bones:  It is a great LV steakhouse without the attitude.  I had the veal cop and my wife had the basic filet.  Both of our entrees were excellent.  Her filet was melt in your mouth fantastic.  My veal had a slight mesquite char to the outside but equally good.  We had the   Caesar and the dressing had a nice twist.  The price point is on the high side for off-strip and downtown premium steak restaurants.  But the service and atmosphere was great.  The RR is a great destination for a night out or a weekend stay and make T-Bones part of your plans.Stopped in here for a quick beer.  Didn't have a chance to try their food, but it smelled and looked amazing.  I'll have to give it a shot next time.  Bartenders were very attentive  even though they were packed.  Great looking outdoor patio too.Coca Cola Sampling, mmm


Like most of the folks here, I swung by to try the Cola samples from around the world.  Once you walk in, you got all your Coca Cola merchandise on the first floor and towards the back, right before the escalators is where the giant polar bear lies for you to take pics with.  I was actuallly.. really scared of it. I knew it was just a costume and someone was in there but, it was just SO big. Definitly had the O.O face as I walked towards it. I think they noticed too since the polar bear kept waving at me .. *waves back with a scared face + awkward smile*  

Made my way up and went on to order the Cola Samples. (Semi cute cashier, just throwing it out there)  There's 16 different flavors split between two trays for about $7.  If you're coming with friends and fam, don't you even think about getting one order each.  It's something you can share with.. many a folks since all you really want is a sip and not even so for some of the more "unique" flavors.  (There's one that tasted like mouthwash, but I'll let you guys figure out which one it is). So fade in, get your sip on and look out for the "oh, hm, uh uh" faces.This is my favorite Thai place in Vegas so far.  Looks like a fast food joint on the outside (even has a drive-thru window for quick take out pick up), but inside it's very classy with cozy tables and an aquarium.  The food is always fabulous!  I would highly reccommend the Spicy Eggplant, and of course the Pad Thai.  Skip the spring rolls though.  Spiciness levels can vary- sometimes "5" is just perfect, other times way too hot, so be careful!  Excellent service- very polite and friendly servers.  Never much of a wait either.This place is to die for!! The red seafood combination curry is THE BOMB DOT COM! This place is nothing less then amazing! The serves are always coming to check on you and are very courteous. The place is super clean. Fresh vegetables, great portions, and service is excellent. This place is my absolute favorite Thai food spot. They are quick with your order and they have never disappointed with the flavor and quality of their food. They only thing I disapprove of is they are closed one day of the week!! LolYou can't go wrong with Buffalo Wild Wings. Beer, Wings, and over a dozen flat screens on which to watch sporting events. The only thing l will say, is that it sometimes gets too loud and it's hard to carry a conversation.The Cafe is slightly hidden from the main areas of Mandalay Bay, and when you see the breakfast prices you begin understand why they did so.  $20 for a 2 egg breakfast with juice is kind of a splurge, but when I cook eggs at home, they don't turn out nearly this good.  These were probably the best eggs that I've ever had, and I don't even like eggs that much!  They give you about 5 or 6 different choices for a meat, and the Portuguese sausage is an excellent choice.  I'm a little iffy on the potatoes, tho - not quite as crisp or tasty as I would like, but it's still an awesome breakfast.  Your bread comes with jam served in tiny jars, since the Smuckers plastic container with the peel-back lid isn't fancy enough for The Cafe.  It's impossible to wrong with the 2 egg breakfast, but the smoked salmon platter also sounded amazing.

Breakfast and lunch only - no dinner.  If you're hungry and staying at The Hotel, run downstairs to The Cafe for a yummy breakfast.Spoiled enough to get to come here for dinner with some of my gfs. 
This was one of the most amazing dining experiences I've ever been through. 
The restaurant was spacious and the staff was extremely attentive.
Every dish served had amazing thought and creativity behind it.  Both surprising your taste buds and rewarding it at the same time. 

Can't say enough for the bread cart (I'm a bread lover :D ) and the cute dessert cart in the end.

Got the tasting menu, and just when I think they are done with the dishes being brought out, I was informed I was only half way through.

Truffle risotto was my handsdown favorite!!!

The only downside is the length of dinner, we took about 5 hours for the 4 of us since there was just so much to eat!!I was very surprised by our visit to Outback tonight.

Out management team is in town for a meeting and we decided to grab a quick dinner.

Our waitress Trista was very attentive to our needs.

Our drinks never went empty.

Our food was cooked perfectly.

My only complaint is our table was very close to a table on both sides of us so it became a little to cozy.Is it damning with faint praise to  say it's the best restaurant of its type when there's no analog within the city?      Until now  most of my experience with the pasties, or bridies as we called a  very similar dish In Scotland, has been uniformly  bad in the USA.  E.g  every  British theme pub has one on the menu  and seem to share the  same supplier.

This was so much better than I had hoped.  That they had draft cider too was  even better , a rarity in AZ, but perfect sense given the origin of the pasty in the English  West Country. Should have been Scrumpy ,a man can dream can't he? 

The complaints about them not being traditional fillings is , well, odd. There wasn't a lot of variety in the UK diet,  less so on the working class end. So   On to the food.   Everything about the decor,  waiting time and suitability for groups is true.  Staff are friendly and  frankly it's nice to be left alone   rather than constant hovering. 

Onto the food. Pastry  rocks,  they've nailed it.   It supports the  contents right to the last.   

Fillings I had the Lamb Vindaloo which was close, but, but missing a sharpness/ e.g  vinegar, that I usually look for but it was still really good.  Dipping sauce complements it nicely.  My wife had the banger's and mash  version with  a red wine sauce.  Again  pretty good. 

So why  four stars?    Many comments here have mentioned a lack of sensitivity  with regards to the flavors/ herbs and the thyme was   way overused on the bangers/mash gravy and it's  a shame as you could taste what they were trying to get at. Additionally the price may seem like a little on the high side ( would be  daily)  but  think about what you have paid for every processed , gray meat  excuse, of a pasty  and just smile.    Worth  working your way through the menu.This narrow restaurant is tucked away in a strip mall in Tempe near ASU. Popular among the hippy type, it reminds me of my time in Portland, OR. There are only a handful of two seater tables and one long bar for seating. The restaurant fills up fast at dinner time and is a very tight fit to try to find an open seat among patrons and servers. 

I ordered the Royale with Cheese. I would have liked to have it without mushrooms but the pasties are pre-made so no changes or substitutions can be made. Luckily the mushrooms were pretty big and easy to pick out. The pasty was delicious overall but the meat was a bit salty. The menu says it has french fries but they are really just potatoes cut like fries and not actually deep fried. I liked that. I was afraid the french fries would make it too greasy but they were a great addition. 

My friend had a Cottage Pie Pasty. He said it was delicious and had no complaints. The red wine sauce complimented it well.

As I noted above, this place can get pretty busy and the servers run around like crazy serving and bussing tables. Service isn't superb but the food really makes up for it. Go here and you won't be disappointed.White ale is awesome,, chicken tikka pasty is nice :)I'm eager to go back and try more dishes!

I ordered an array of contemporary sushi pieces. I told the sushi chef what fish I was in the mood for (akami tuna, hirame, fluke, hamachi) and he created some spectacular duos (see pictures) - the fish was definitely fresh, although some of his creations were better than others, and some were overpowered by his use of greens, resulting in lack of flavor; Which is why I only give them 4 stars. 

The Black Cod soy was phenomenal, but I recommend you share it with someone as the tastes can be a little too much after a few bites.

They have an excellent Sake menu as well. Service was sub par as far as politeness. One of the servers actually shouted across the restaurant while we were dining, so I'm not immediately jumping in my car to try this place again- maybe in a few months.Moon Nightclub is located at the top of The Palms.  I came here on a Friday night and both guys and girls were free to get in.  In addition, girls got 2 free drinks.  Can't ask for anything more.  The club has great views of the strip.  There are scantily clad women that dance on platforms, pretty good music and a lower lounge that used to be the playboy lounge.  The lower lounge was pretty dead compared to the dance area upstairs.  The club is also located off the strip so if you are staying on the strip, you will have to make a long walk or drive.I came back for seconds since I was staying at MGM! Their steak and eggs warm sandwich was good, but their tomato soup with parmesan was great! The sandwich was nice and warm and made on the spot! The soup stayed hot so be careful. You can also order half soup and half sandwich, so I had to try their grilled cheese with the tomato soup which was AWESOME!! Affordable and located inside MGM Grand.In my fairly short experience I have found that my favorite pregancy food is wheat pancakes.  How did I find this out?  A friend brought me here for breakfast the other day and those plain wheat pancakes took me through the day (2 meals) and erased my nagging sickness.  Any meal that can nuke the puke is good by me so I'll definitely be back

In general the food is good (excellent bacon, just the right amount of done) and the fresh oj hit the spot.  They even accomodated my friend's young daughter and made her the strawberry pancakes in kid form so we didn't have to pay the $9 for the adult ones.Breakfast here was great!  Highly recommend it!  Seeing what the rest of Scottsdale has to offer, I was disappointed that they didn't serve dinner.Had a great brunch type meal to start my day and recommend getting the half & half.  You can't go wrong.  Sizeable portions.  On weekends, it gets super busy so I go during the week.  Also ordered take-out and was finished on time.Simply put, I do not eat here enough. I should make it a point to eat here at least every other week because they are that GOOD.

They are always busy but the food is always fresh and delicious. 

I have loved almost everything I have tried here except the falafel. Otherwise, I would have given them 5 stars but their falafel is a little on the dry side for me.

The Gyro's are always amazing. Filled with just enough meat to veggies ratio and the perfect tzatziki sauce.

The kabobs are always on point and have yet to disappoint me yet. Never dry or overcooked. Perfectly moist and the most delicious tantalizing bites I can put in my mouth.

The hummus and babagoonoosh are always a huge hit for me too.

I love this place.

The prices are very accommodating and I love that I can call ahead to pick up my order.This place is good.  It's little high price, but it was good Thai food.  I wish the portion size was bigger.Great atmosphere and drinks are unique. I love to pre-game at the Downtown Cocktail lounge. It atmosphere is very chill and drink are pretty good. The music played by the DJ could range from electronica to Trip hop. The servers and bartenders are very friendly. You should definitely try out their Absinthe drinks. They're pretty good.MADE is going to be my new stop for unique gifts and the occasional treat for myself.  The shop if filled to the brim with an eclectic selection of books, cards, jewelry, art, children's toys, pet toys, decorations, clothing and accessories.  If you have a few minutes to browse the wares offered in this adorable shop, you are guaranteed to find a gift for just about anyone!  Don't miss the gallery attached to the back of the shop.  It is small, but has some amazing pieces to ponder.I actually ate at the wolfgang puck bistro located in the venetian hotel and this location as well both times were great which is why it deserves 4 stars.

At the bar and grill I had the salmon which is uniquely served with vegetables under and some green sauce which was great as well.

At the bistro I had the lobster and bacon club sandwich which was also great served with garlic shoestring fries.

and for desert get the raspberry ice cream with chocolate cake can't remember the exact name for it right about now !

as for appetizers, make sure you try the pizza and popcorn shrimp because those deserve 4 1/2 stars !There is so much that is packed into the small, totally unassuming space.  For starters, if my sister didn't start walking up the pathway to the front door, I never would have known this was a bar.  I looks just like a house, with just a small "Open" sign giving it any sort of resemblance to a bar from the outside.  Once inside, the vibe of this place is out of this world.  Folks of the low key, kinda-funky kinda-normal variety inhabit the place, with great local artwork adoring the walls and once small bar area in the back corner.  Don't come hungry, but definitely come thirsty, especially if you are like me and love your beer. This ranks towards the top of my list of places where you can drink beers from all over the nation (and the world) under one roof.  Two columns of beer fill the menu, and you get a great bang for your buck on the prices of these beers.  Even if you are not an artsy, hipster, funky type of person, if you love your beer at all you must step foot inside.  You will not be disappointed.This is one of the greatest place to wind down after a long night because it's the only coffee shop I know off from the strip that's open 24hrs.  I've held many great conversations here with a good friend, good ambience, good crowd, and friendly bartista. Great place to study as well if you can find room to sit inside.Being that there are a limited amount of Korean restaurants in the valley it's hard to try to compare them. It's either good or bad. Although some of these places go through many changes in owners and the quality and service fluctuates.

Nothing can compare to Southern Cali Korean food but this place has been a favorite for the family. There are other places but this is the closest and never had anything bad. I love the table top grill and can never say I no to this place. 

I don't know about the sushi here since I always known it for just the Korean food so I will just stick to that. Anyone wanting to try Korean food do it right and go all out here!!!

Another cool thing about this place is, during spring training there are a lot of Korean Baseball players in the majors, when they are in town they are known to frequent this place more than once a week, who knows they might even bring their teammates.I can safely say that Oreganos has the best stuffed pizza in the state of Arizona. It takes about 45 minutes to bake, so on top of the general 20-60 minute wait for a table... just make sure you come on a night you have plenty of time and are in the mood for a good time. While you wait, there is a full bar with staff that will be happy to greet you and offer a drink. 

The location isn't huge, almost 40% of the seating is available on their patio (along with a second, much smaller, outdoor bar).Great neighborhood pizza joint. Zack, our server, was extremely friendly and laughed when i called him Adam all during lunch. The wings were good and the thin crust pizza was excellent. A good value for your money.  Another wonderful place in Gilbert and we shall be back!!This place is pretty great and it doesn't hurt that it is walking distance from my apartment. Really good food with more variety than normal bar food.  Great beer specials.  There is a band that plays Thursday nights and they mostly do covers of songs that are fun to sing along or dance to.

And...they have NTN.  What more could you want?Cheap. Decor, good foodI first read about Bouchon a few months ago while perusing the blog of a really awesome food blogger.  Breakfast is the most important meal of the day, so I figured I'd start my day properly with a visit to Bouchon Bakery.  I didn't feel like blowing my funds on a full sit-down brunch, so the bakery downstairs was the next best thing.  Not to say that the bakery is cheap (omfg, Porto's in LA...) but it's a more thrifty alternative. 

We picked up a tomato/feta focaccia (which the server offered to warm up for us) and banana walnut muffin.  Both were delicious.  The muffin was moist and not too sweet; the focaccia was savory and tasty. Nothing fancy, but the quality was more or less there.  One day, I think I'll actually venture up into the restaurant... but for my first Vegas trip, the bakery would suffice. :)

If you're passing through the Venetian, go ahead and pick up a snack while you browse the interesting and eclectic assortment of goods that you probably can't afford.Hi- new to yelp and to Phoenix- but wanted to put a plug in for Pink Pepper.   While relocating here and living out of hotels, I found myself going back to this place at least twice a week- both for the food and the friendly people.  The service is great, the prices are reasonable, and the food is fresh and very authentic.  Of course, being new to the area, I haven't really checked out many other places!  But I have been to Thailand and Pink Pepper's food is very authentic.  If you're looking for trendy decor or a place to be seen, this is probably not the place for you.  But if you want good Thai- go here, ask for the seafood salad- and if you like it really hot, say "pet mahk mahk!" and be prepared!Cool spot to get the international goodies.We came for lunch on a Monday.  We met up with some friends who were staying at the hotel.  We were seated and immediately told that they server was really busy and that he would be with us as soon as he can.  After looking around it looked like they had a large group sitting upstairs.  

When Tim did arrive at the table he took his time and answered any questions that we had.  We placed our drink orders, I had a root beer that was on draft.  The root beer was served in a beer type glass with no ice.  It was some of the best root beer that I've ever tasted.  

I ordered a Lil Boy Blue burger.  The burger was perfectly cooked to medium.  The toppings were fresh with two types of onions, caramelized and raw.  It also had a lettuce, tomato, and of course Blue Cheese.   You have different options for the buns, I choose a whole wheat one.  It was fresh and tasted great! The fries were delicious and hot, just the right amount of salt!

Although I won't be rushing back here, It will be in the back of my mind for when I'm in the mood for some great root beer and a burger.Good AYCE and sushi is very good.Great place when hungry for a really good burger. The fries are excellent. Try to not eat burgers much, but when I/we do, this is the place of choice.

Prices are reasonable, service is good and food is yummy.An absolutely beautiful gym with pretty much everything you can ask for in one spot. 

Nestled within DC Ranch, walking up to the Village is like entering a luxury resort. The professional staff greets you cheerfully as they scan you in. 

You descend to the luxurious locker room areas where your membership card serves as a key for your daily locker. The locker room is stocked with everything you need to get ready for the day post-workout - showers feature shampoo, conditioner, lotion, shaving cream, and even razors. Fluffy white towels and washcloths are plentiful, and there are vanity stations complete with hairdryers, flatirons, curling irons, q-tips, cottonballs, mouthwash, and makeup mirrors.

Stop by the water station on the main level to fill your cup with ice and water to take with you while you work out.

Once you hit the gym-floor, the options are endless. Upstairs is an extensive cardio area with ellipticals, stairmasters, and treadmills. There is also jogging track, a Kinesis area and TRX area on the upper level. The main floor has a basketball court, racquetball courts, and a weight training area with a few hidden surprises like a Curve treadmill (not electronic and VERY challenging) and Jacob's Ladder. 

I've attended several group classes including Pilates mat classes, Interval Training, Kinesis, and Core, all of which have been challenging and fun. The trainers are friendly and helpful, providing good instructions. The equipment is in good condition and is plentiful. 

The cafe has some great healthy options for a post-work out meal, although they also offer some pretty tempting non-healthy options as well (Pizza, chili fries, cookies) which are tricky when you're trying to burn off those calories :) 

Features I haven't yet used are their childcare (which I hear is wonderful), the salon and spa, and the pool. 

The gym can get a bit crowded during peak hours and I've had a few workouts that were derailed from my original plan because there were group classes taking place in the area I planned to use (ie. the weight area) but the nice thing is that there are so many options that it's not too tough to readjust. 

The Village is one of the few places I can say it is a pleasure to work out :)Sherman, set the Wayback machine for 1961, we are going to the Hotel Valley Ho, in a little patch of desert called "Scottsdale, Arizona".
It was my birthday this week and my kids were in town to make sure that I continue to get older:)
I did get older, but not by much...and certainly no wiser:)
We stayed at the Valley Ho, so I could celebrate in style (and keep the condo neat and tidy:)
It wasn't so much a "staycation", as it was a chance to live a little differently for few days. You don't turn 40 for the first time very often and this seemed like a memorable way to mark the date:)
When we checked in at the Valley Ho, the Chairman (Frank Sinatra) was styling his way through "Luck be a Lady" and we thought we had stepped back to a simpler time...a time in which celebrity was worshiped and fawned over, just because they are famous...a time when you could lounge by the pool and day-drink your cares away...a time when just getting yourself to the bar was enough work for one day:)
In short, we stepped squarely into 2009:)
The Valley Ho delivers on the promise of nostalgia for an unremembered past...a mid-century revival of the avocado green, pastel turquoise and rust orange memories that almost none of us share, but that we all long for.
The Valley Ho takes you to the Disney version of 1961 and damn it, I liked it...a lot!
I found myself thoroughly enjoying the suite (the room and the hotel look like the '60's, but with HDTV, iPod plugs, decent tubs, good cell phone reception, double headed showers and really comfortable beds:)
I found myself wishing for the return of fins on my car and car hops on roller skates, along with $.25 a gallon gas and $.25 a gallon Tequila (almost interchangeable for both drinking and fueling purposes:)
Room service, spa, workout facility, restaurant and the pool are all first rate, and the people watching is wonderful...this place has become a destination again!
The pool is a terrific place to give people watching a real workout:) The Oh Bar pours a nice drink and they keep 'em comin!
Lots of eye candy for the guys and girls to ogle and everybody mixing and mingling like there is no tomorrow...and maybe that's true!
Maybe there is no tomorrow at the Valley Ho...When you step through the time warp back to 1961, but get to bring your 2009 stuff with you...the price you pay is getting stuck in the vortex of "now"...but at the Valley Ho, "now" seems to work:)We've been here twice, and we had a great experience both times. From the service to the bread to the wine to the steak, this restaurant is first class. No matter where we go in Vegas, I usually order steak, and this steak is hands-down my favorite. It is expensive, so know that going in and you'll have a fabulous time! I always eat waaaaayyyy too much and need a nap afterward!

Note: They are known for their Cajun rub, but we did not enjoy that flavor at all. Stick with just a plain ol' steak... no need to get fancy :)

Let me reiterate: Don't pass up the bread!The hotel itself is just A-OK. It is getting on in years and until they remodel all of the guest suites it will be nothing special. 

The pool more than makes up for the drab rooms! It features a slide, a play pool, a waterfall, a lazy river, and plenty of lounge chairs. I've never had to visit the pool area with children, so I can't really speak to the safety of everything. But I really enjoy the laid back atmosphere of this area. 

The poolside drinks are really expensive. I recommend pregaming in your room and buying one more down by the pool!Great food, great happy hour specials, nice waitstaff.If I could give separate ratings for the movie theater experience and the restaurant/bar experience, I would give the theater a 4 star rating and the bar/restaurant a 2 or 3 star rating. Here's why:

The movie theater is probably my preferred choice in the Phoenix metro area. Christown? No freakin' way. I don't want to get shot on the way to my car. Tempe marketplace? Not unless you want to watch 17-year olds make out in every row. Arizona Center, nope. Not there, either.  

The theater is pretty clean, and paying the extra two bucks to sit in giant, reclining chairs, have an assigned seat, not deal with kids talking, etc. is totally worth it, IMO. I can just purchase my tickets online and avoid having to wait in line or the possibility that the showing will be sold out. Genius.

Parking is in an attached garage and is free when you remember to validate.

Honestly, the only negative thing I really have to say about the theatre itself is that every time I go into a restroom there, the first stall is always out of tp. Always. Sometimes the second, too. The bathrooms seem to be cleaned and maintained regularly, except for this detail, which kind of turns into a big detail when there are twenty women waiting in line for the bathroom when the movie gets out. It must be the Murphy's Law of movie theatre bathrooms. Ugh. 

The bar/restaurant is mehhh. If it were just a stand alone restaurant, it wouldn't be anywhere I'd frequent for the food itself. Think an above-average Applebee's. But having the option to actually order real food (and DRINKS!) in the theatre is pretty neat. The waitstaff always does a good job of not being disruptive during the movie, and are usually very friendly. Candy/soda/popcorn can also be ordered, at pretty typical movie theatre prices. But again, not having to stand in line with 50 other people for a package of red vines and a sprite makes it SO worth it.

Lastly, there are two theatre types. Cinema Suites and Fork & Screen. When you go online to check showtimes/purchase tickets, it shows you what type of theatre every particular showing is in. There's usually some in each type of theatre for each movie. This is where it gets kinda weird-fork and screen is fine, I would still come here if that was the only type of theatre. Still a comfy chair in a way better theatre. But after sitting in the cinema suites, you won't want to go back. Huge seats (that recline! woot!) and way more space in between the groups of seats. Because the last thing you want is to be sitting THIS CLOSE to a stranger who's apparently never eaten a taco before and loves to elbow bump all movie long.Why did I eat Mcdonald's the afternoon before I came to B&B? 

Bad move.

So I did my best to soothe my weak stomach with ginger ale to prepare for my long awaited meal at B&B.  I'm slightly picky with food, especially meat, so I had the beet salad and the goat cheese raviolini.  The menu is pretty diverse so be sure to ask a lot of questions.  Our server was really attentive and able to answer our many questions.  

The layout of the restaurant is simple and elegant.  Lots of dark wood, a huge wall of wine bottles, nice lighting.  My food was pretty good but because it's one of Mario Batali's restaurants, I expected to be blown away.  I can't say that I was, but I also wasn't feeling my absolute best and probably would have enjoyed it a lot more if I was.First time to B&B and while overall good ..... Improvements can be made. My wife and I selected two different tasting menus so we could compare them. My wife's pasta courses were very good and the first course absolutely perfect. My regional menu was very unique but a bit inconsistent. I will say that the calf's brain ravioli was one of the best dishes I have ever eaten. Inconsistency however kept a star off my rating. My wife's last pasta course was super spiced and was left un eaten and my cheese plater was as forgettable as a Costco sampling.  The wine pairings really helped the meal and the service was perfect.   Pricey for the experience but what the heck....it's Vegas!Not really sure why some many people have not found this place to be outstanding. I have experienced many places like this but this is one of the best I have had! If you want traditional style then you found it here. The servers were great and the quality of meats were just about perfect! I am sure it may change from night to night but I am a fan!I thought the animal rights activist in me would get pretty pissed at this place, but they actually take care of the lions very well. In total, there are about 27 lions, and they get rotated out. They stay at a ranch for most of the time, and a lion spends up to 6 hours in the habitat. They have trainers in the habitat with them and the lions seems very happy. its completely sound proof, climate control, purified air, serene environment. The only bad thing is all the damn flashes, but at a zoo, you would get flashes too. at least here, they don't hear anything except the waterfall. It can be hard to get a good view, but the lions seem very relaxed, and are usually sleeping. They sleep like 18 hours a day, just like house cats. Plus, the lion habitat is free, can't get better than that!In town for a two night stay and having been to Vegas several times, I looked forward to staying at Caesar's for the first time ever in my life.  It usually is pricy but I scored a $99 per night reservation.  Upon arrival, I found out the hard way that self parking is on the opposite side of where the lobby is.  Soooo be ready to walk through the whole casino with your luggage to check in at the front desk or check in your baggage at the Bell Desk.  

By the afternoon, I was ready to check in but upon arriving, I didn't see any sort of lines being formed.  Unlike other casinos, Caesar's didn't have the DIsneyland queue where people line up to check in.  So lines were just being formed randomly behind every front desk person that they had.  Not exactly the most organized way as I was able to score a short line while I saw another person standing 5 deep.

The room was pretty good from the Forum Tower.  The room is a bit older but had a good view of the West Vegas side facing Rio and the Palms.  The shower had the "rain" faucet and the bathroom mirror had a little TV inside.  Unfortunately the TV was on the outside and not where the toilet was.  Boooooo!  

Caesar's location on the Strip and proximity to other casinos made it a pleasant place to stay despite the horrendous triple digit temperatures that I had to deal with.  The location, plus the quality room, at a decent price makes it a definite desirable option for any out of town group who wants to set up their vacation home base in the mid-Strip.Request a room in their newer towers that were recently renovated. much nicer and up to date.I've stayed a Caesar's a few times, and this last time I have to say they have really stepped it up.  Every time I'd see someone from the hotel staff, they'd take a second to ask how my day was going and see if there was anything I needed.  The place pretty much speaks for itself, so there's really no need to go on and on about the decor, but the pools (and the bar at the pool) is awesome and a perfect way to spend a day.  You'll probably want to stake out a chair early, since they tend to fill up pretty quick on the weekends.  All in all it was a great experience, and Caesar's is definitely my "go to" when I'm in Vegas.

My only criticism would be that the Bloody Mary's at the bar/restaurant near the front desk are absolutely wretched, but I won't hold that against them... :)Went here for opening day of the season this year... and GLAD we did!  FREE admission. FREE daybed.  FREE booze.  18 Pitchers of Margaritas later and our tops were off.  Not sure about the other reviews who were implying that they saw some not so great tits but while we were here everyone exposed deserved to be.  Made some new friends including a UFC fighter and had an awesome time!  Will definitly be back when I visit sin city in a few weeks.I love Pita Jungle.  Mainly I visit for their hummus and ice tea.  Plus the shrimp/pita/tomato thingy is to die for!  Parking at the 44th/Indian School road location is a nightmare so just run in and pick it up!This Pita Jungle does an excellent job with takeout. I can call ahead, order my food and within ten minutes, the food will be waiting for me in the front. I also enjoy the reading material waiting for me should I decide to walk in and order it instead. So I am adding this to my list of favorites for take out that gets me in and out!I have always loved David and Goliath ever since there was an exhibit of David and Goliath art at the Grove in Los Angeles. (That was a long time ago). Forgot that there was a David and Goliath store in Vegas until today! Just happened upon it and had to get my favorite of the David & Goliath designs "PEAS ON EARTH." Ended up with the t-shirt. $30. Wanted the collector canvas but it was $99 and it was small. Just happy I got my shirt! Pricey for a t-shirt if you ask me, but I am treating this shirt like a piece of art.I love Encanto Park. I initially came here because I live so close, but there are a bunch of reasons why I come back. First of all, it's beautiful. There's a little lake and water system that runs through the park with a few walking bridges that add a nice touch. There are tons of walking trails and ducks/birds/swans/turtles to look at. My boyfriend has hit golf balls there a few times and really enjoys the facility. There may be a hobo lurking here and there, but that's what you get almost anywhere in downtown Phoenix. There's a children's amusement park that I have yet to go to, but I'll amend my post once I've gone.

Overall, this park is perfect for an afternoon stroll, a book in the shade, or place to hit a few balls.The PROS:  Excellent Sound - All great seats - Easy to get to from the casino area.  Thoroughly enjoyed the k.d. lang concert ....possibly the best show I've ever been to!!!

The CONS:  Do NOT buy drinks here.  They "pour" the drink from a gun that shoots out exactly one oz of alcohol ....then they charge you like you just ordered a bottle of effing Cristal.  ....I made the mistake of ordering a long island tea, which tasted like pure bar mix (everyone agreed) that I had to return as the show started.  My gf got a simple vodka/diet & we basically had to take out a loan to pay our bill.  Stupid...ridiculous....over-the-top maddening.

Bring your own bottle into the venue and order a soda as a mixer - save yourself $50 for 2 rounds of awful weak drinks in tiny plastic cups.  Nobody searched my purse, so feel free : )

Enjoy the show!  Great venue!Weird thing happened to me. I was driving and there was this car accident on Charleston. People who know me understand how I get when it's car accidents...I get antsy. Plus I was thinkin of food. Mmmm salad. Something light you know. But I did smell fried food.....So while I was waiting for cars to hurry at 2 mph just to get past me I noticed this M & M Soul Food. Now I remember M & M from LA and I wondered if it was the same thing. I got retarded and drove over the median and pulled into the parking lot. Sure. It's 10:30am. I'm thinkin granola and my fat ass is getting soul food! Walking into this establishment - well it's no 4 star restaurant. It reminded me kinda like a truck stop place....Kool Aid 2.00 WTF? Well we gotta keep the Kool Aid man in Bling! 
I saw a sign. Oxtail.....then I saw another......Chicken wings and waffles. I wanted the oxtail. The savoring of oxtail - stewed for hours, falling off the bone goodness of melting meat....
(music stops) Oxtail won't be done for another hour....NOOOOoooo Christmas is ruined again.
What about pork chops? Smothered or fried. Holy crap....decisions...I ended with fried with mac and cheese and red beans and rice. Definitely some of the best fried pork chops I've ever had - with hot sauce....Mmmm It was crispy and juicy, full of flavor.
What? You think that's it? HELL NAH! I had chicken and waffles. MMMMmmm Damn not as great as Roscoe's but hell it was GOOD!
I definitely am coming back for everything else on the menu. It was just way too hot to eat some of this stuff.....Wow...Thinking about it now...
I'd like a salad.Very good food, large portions and excellent service. Every time I am in Vegas this place is a must!I really like this place!  If you want an old fashion barber, where you can get an actual razor shave and beer or other drinks?  I say, pretty cool.....

Location - 5 Star - very convenient on the southeast corner of Eastern and Coronado Center Drive where U-Swirl and Sushi Wa is located. I like places where there is plenty access and this one has it.

Service -  4 star - I find the service to be like almost all other places, just a slight bit higher. What this means is that they are sure pleasant enough and efficient enough.  Just not anything tremendously special to give it a 5.  Of course they offer you drink and or a beer if you desire one and for this, that is why they get a four. 

The Haircut - 4 Star - I find the haircuts here for my kids are very, very good. The quality is very even, and there is care and attention.  At the other franchise places, you feel like you are in a revolving door as they take care of you in 7 minutes - 10 minutes when you have a simple boys / mens style.  Here, they truly take their time.

If you want a traditional barber, this is certainly the place to go.  Price wise, I have to give them a 3 star.  20.00 for a boy cut is 5.00 cheaper than the men's/beer/message price, however, 20.00 is a bit on the high side.

GK says, check this place out!Sandwiches!!

Dude, this is my favorite banh mi place evoooooore! It's really inexpensive and the ingredients are super fresh.  The bread is freshly made, and they have a ton of selections. I really like the chinese egg and sausage banh mi and the charbroiled pork one. MMMM! The sandwiches are about $3-$4, so it's handy for broke college students like myself (also located across the street-ish from the Trop garage of UNLV). I've had pho from here too, and it was pretty decent, but I usually just go for banh mi.  The soup was just cause I was sick that day and had to study haha. Still tasty nonetheless. 

Downsides: This place smells like smoke! gaaah, horrible.  I recommend taking your food to go, unless you like the taste/smell of carcinogens with your food.  Also, the service when you're seated is kinda slow.  I drink a ton of water and the refills didn't come quick enough after I loaded my sandwich with Sriracha.  Plus, they don't really have consistent waiters or whatever.  It's like everyone is doing everthing? I'm not sure. Personally, that's not really a big deal for me since I feel like most authentic Asian restaurants have that same kind of attitude, but sometimes people wanna be dined for real so be cautious 0.0 

Overall, I'd definitely come back...and back...and back again.  It's tasty, low cost, and it's right by school, which is the biggest seller for me.  It's something different from Chipotle or whatever is around campus.This is the place to go for authentic Japanese; they even have a special Japanese-specific menu that's not normally given out that has a ton of good stuff on it.

I've been here 3 or 4 times in the past month with my wife and the food is always excellent, and the staff always friendly.  Prices are reasonable.

If you're looking for super-Americanized sushi they can make it but you'll be better off at Ra/Kona Grill or somewhere where the club music is blasting at eight million db.I don't understand the people who don't like or understand the light rail. I think its a big step in the Valley embracing being a big city. I live near the light rail route so maybe I'm biased, but having the light rail has gotten me more out and about trying new restaurants downtown and in Tempe. It's a nice ride and a great cost savings on game nights.Awesome white pizza!  I still dream of those mounds of ricotta!  Price-y at $15 plus tax for an 8" pie, but recommendable.  I liked the eggplant rollatini, but it was too salty, so I won't be ordering that again.  Ooh, but what I wouldn't do to have a slice or two of that white pizza again... 

(If only Miele's would serve whole wheat pizza crusts like Nello's, I might be persuaded to bump the review up to 5 stars.)This store is surprisingly legit. Fry's has managed to do something that no other chain has. At peaks times, they have an employee directing customers to fast check out lines so you are out in a heartbeat. Do you hear me Safeway? They have more than one lane open! Groundbreaking stuff, I know.

This store has soul, good employees and good products. I routinely save a ton of money, and not just because I am a shoplifter. Just kidding.

Check this place out, it's where the SoSco locals go.This is one of my favorite Scottsdale stops for breakfast. The drive thru makes it super convenient and the food is always good. My personal favorites are the croissant sandwich and the az burro. Their coffees are also delish!While visiting Phoenix during our Canadian Thanksgiving weekend, we figured what's a more American activity than shooting some guns? :)

My girlfriend (who's also my coworker) had recently attended a skeet shooting team building event so we thought we'd show off our skills to our boyfriends. The four of us arrived shortly after 10AM and they set us up with some waivers as we watched a safety video and took a short quiz. With our ear plugs, eye protection and shooting gear, we were ready to go. The guide gave us a quick demo on the clay releases, reinforced gun safety and then we were set to go on our own. We did manage to make it thru about 10 stations, but being that it gets quite hot in Phoenix as the day progresses, we didn't stay as long as we would have liked. (There was a whole other section of stations we could have tried out)

It worked out to be about $50 for us ($30 for 100 clays and $10 for gun rental + taxes) and honestly that's pretty good for a morning of entertainment.I went looking for the typical "not real Chinese" buffet on a Sunday and found this place.  Never had Dim Sum before so thought this would be different. From the moment we sat down, the carts were on us putting stuff on the table and having us choose from a selection that I honestly cannot tell you what I ate.  I just said yes to what looked good.  I wasn't disappointed, but I can't tell you what I ate! :)  I do know that I accidentally said yes to the chicken feet thinking is was just fried chicken.  I'm adventurous, but that was too much so I left it.  Without even asking, they were cool enough to take it off of the bill.  We all laughed about how the server's children loved it, and they were really great.  The cart ladies struggle with English a lot, but that's OK as again, I just said yes to what looked good.  Overall the price was pretty reasonable and I tried a lot of food. I'll be back!Maybe it's weird that I am a girl. But I like this bar. The service is always spot on. The staff is friendly and the beer is good and cold. Has a good happy hour menu and it may be swamped with guys but I still like the Tilted Kilt for the fact that you know what your getting!Yummy food.  I like to eat here for lunch. Everything is good but my favorites are the quesadilla and huge salad, the best part is the creamy green tomatillo dressing (looks like ranch but green) I put it on everything not just the salad but the burritos,  tacos,  and even dip my quesadilla in it.I'm a DIY kinda guy. I like working on my car. I like fixing up the house. I enjoy these things not because (like so many hipsters) I think its cute or cool. I fix things because I'm cheap, and I think things should last. The awesome thing about Harbor Freight is that they sell tools that are cheap and that last. They have almost any kind of air tool or power tool you could need, plus enough hand tools to build an arc or repair a aircraft carrier. My only qualms are that they don't have fittings for PVC and the lack of a lumber yard.Great Staff.I go here for the three dollar sandwiches.  You can't beat the price, especially for a prepared sandwich with fresh ingredients.  I will be back soon!I like coming to Tempe Town Lake to relax and walk around. It's quiet enough so that you can listen to the airplanes approaching . It's a good place to get to know someone special. This is the closest we'll get to "walks on the beach". 

It's just a good place to hang out. Enjoy the nice quiet site of the lake.Mimi sampler is a good appetizer.  The zucchini is cut the long way, for a good zucchini flavor over the breading.  
I enjoy the Chicken Cordon Bleu, as it tastes fresh, and well cooked.  In retrospect this meal was heavy on the fried side, so I will search for a different combination next time.I ordered the Cajun belly rub Burger and fries for dinner, burger was good not as spicy as I expected, but that didn't stop me from eating every messy bite and needing a belly rub after...  My daughter and her cousin split the BBQ wings appetizer and if sauce all over their hands isn't proof they enjoyed it, you should have seen their faces! It's a great family place for dinner. The girls loved the dog pictures everywhere and they especially loved eating peanuts from a dog dish and dropping the shells on the floor. Good atmosphere and service too!A neighbor of mine turned me on to ASC and Im glad he did. As far as I know its pretty much so the premier indoor soccer facility all us soccer fanatics here in AZ. I've been playing for several years now and I really enjoy the set up over there. The only complaints would be that the outside nets suck and the surface out there needs some work as well but other than that its all good.My friends raved about Hungry Howie's Pizza, because they have flavored crust. Ranch, cheese, butter cheese (huh?), garlic, and maybe some other flavors that I'm forgetting but too lazy to find out about. 

I don't usually eat my crust. It's just one of those things, so I figured if I could eat my pizza crust here, then I would give it a high rating. 

I've heard about Hungry Howie's, but have never eaten it, because apparently the closest location is in Santee, and I don't venture to the Santee area on a normal basis. Like, ever. So, we ordered 3 pizzas, 3 flavored crusts: Ranch, Garlic, and Cheese. 

Ranch crust = salty as all hell. I ate one of my pizza crusts, but drank half of my bottle of water afterwards. 

Cheese crust = fine. Nothing awesome about it. 

Garlic crust = deliciousness. 

I would say the actual pizza is equivalent to Round Table. Which, is not a bad thing at all. 

I would also say that....I would order pizza from here again....If there was a location even remotely close to me in CA. Wait, I won't be living in CA anymore, so maybe I still have a chance.Did a good job of getting us back on the road after a bad blowout. Explained why tire blew, and went over a bad pressure sensor and options on that. There was an issue on getting the right tire from another dealer that took some extra time, but no biggie there.LOVE this little gem tucked away in a strip mall.
The clothes are amazing and the shoes are better than most large department stores. The only draw back is that some of the prices can be high and a little shocking. Great place for unique finds and great sales.

LOVE! LOVE! LOVE!Urban is one of my favorite stores so it couldn't get any better when they opened not one, but two locations in Las Vegas.  Not to mention, they're located within a one mile radius.  This location (Miracle Mile) has a bigger selection but lots of the time it's unorganized.  Go figure, it's in the middle of the strip.  On the other hand, the Mandalay Bay location doesn't have as big of a collection but it's very organized.  The employees are friendlier, too.  If there's a sale going on, be sure to check out both locations because I've noticed they seem to carry slightly different sale items.This is one of the few car washes in this part of town as I think the next closest is Clean Freak Car Wash (not counting the ones at gas stations). I didn't feel like driving that far today so I decided to give Kelley's a try. Not bad.

It has two drive trough car washes, ones where you pump quarters/tokens and do it yourself, and even a full size RV wash. I've never even seen a RV wash, much less an automatic wash so I was impressed. They also have a detail center and a RV dump station (I think $5). So they seemed pretty diverse.

I went through the "soft touch car wash" (far left) and it seemed to do well. The automatic car wash on the right was labeled "quick wash" or something like that and the prices were the same. 

I was a little confused on how the automatic wash worked as I've only gone to the ones where it hooks onto your wheels and pulls you through. This one you drive up and the machine drives around your car and does it's thing.

Here's a tip for you - before you go in grab the brush in the bucket and pre-wet/pre-scrub any difficult areas such as your grill or wheels. That way when the machine goes you have a better chance to get everything off as automatic cleaners generally do a terrible job on those items.

So why the $5 star? I felt like the prices here were a bit higher than other places. I used to have the unlimited plan at Clean Freak where I could go as many times as I wanted in a month, plus I got free and unlimited vacuuming for something like $15 a month - here, the wash is going to cost you $5 to $9.

I am no expert on pricing as I either buy the month plan and use it super frequent or I just wash it at home.Chipotle has some good burritos. I usually get the chicken burrito, with hot salsa, cheese and sour cream. 

The guacamole is also my fav, with chips, not on the burrito, it adds a weird taste, but that could just be me. I can never finish the entire burrito, yes, I've tried... but always need to save the rest for later.This is another Phoenix restaurant with great ambiance and decor. 

I was able to arrive before the rest of my party and had a couple drinks from the outdoor bar. The dirty martinis here are delicious! I also had a couple flatbreads (cheese & chorizo) which were both around $10. They both were very tasty and filling. 

For dinner I split the forbidden rice bowl (I added chicken) and the seafood cioppino ($25). I was surprised how much I liked the rice bowl, I am not exactly sure what type of rice they used, but it was on the sweet side in a good way. Other people at my table had the hanger steak , salmon and the french onion burger, but were not that impressed with it. 

I would suggest giving this restaurant a try, I'm glad I did.Love the lunch specials here.  Such a great spot for lunch and the food is delicious.  The service has always been great too.We were shopping in the area and decided that we were in need of refueling, so we stopped off here to grab a bite. We were greeted right away and opted to sit outside on the porch.

Our waitress was out within a minute or so and took our drink orders and filled us in on the daily specials. She was very friendly. I decided on the Chicken Piccata and he decided on the Lasagna - both came with salads, we went with Caesar. 

The piccata was my favorite dish and there was a slight hint of lemon to the sauce, which really kicked up the flavor in my book.  The chicken was obviously fresh and it was cut into perfect bite sized pieces, so no knife needed on this dish!  His lasagna was good, but just wasn't anything to write home about - although I would probably order it again if I was in the mood for a red sauce dish!

The porch atmosphere was nice, but the tables felt really crowded.  There were high tops, as well as, regular tables all lined up in a row and when people walked by it was pretty much assured you were going to get bumped into.  The day was perfect for sitting outside though, so it was worth it!

We were semi-disappointed that they didn't offer a tiramisu dish, but the apple dessert did sound good and may have to happen next go around.

Overall: A-
A touch crowded porch couldn't damper a good meal with a great view and friendly service!Bought our used ford focus here a few months ago and brought it in today for an oil change. Fast, helpful service and they even filled and rotated our tires! We walked over to the biltmore mall while they worked, but I noted the sign that offers their guess the ability to borrow an ipad while they wait. That's pretty cool.Great bar tucked away from most others. The atmospher along with the staff is second to none. cheap drinks and a good time. Good place to go an just relax with a beer and some good company.I've been craving pizza and Rosati's seemed like the perfect place to satiate that need. We had a promotional discount for a thin crust pie with two toppings. Seemed like a great match for a Friday night. 

Driving up we realized this was more of a joint to call ahead and take the pie home. No biggie tho, the pizza was delish! There are a few tables inside, with very basic fluorescent lighting and close proximity to the register . (There are a few iron wrought tables outside.  I may have missed if there were napkins or supplies there.)

The cashier asked if we had called ahead. (Super chipper and pleasant.) The toppings aren't listed on the wall so we stepped aside to review the menu. The wait time was approximately 20 minutes. Everyone was super helpful and nice.

I have no basis for comparison of a Chicago thin style crust pizza. I hail from New York. I can tell you this thin crust pizza was crunchy and cut into perfect squares and I very much enjoyed it. 

My topping options were equally distributed underneath the cheese. (I went with pineapple and jalapenos). There weren't any goopy sections in the middle where the pie crust wasn't crispy. Yum!

I'd definitely do this again.Love this place for lunch or breakfast. Food is always fresh and nice to get the occasional breakfast for lunch.One of my favorite breakfast places!Always packed which is a good sign! Very good foodWe get take out often - it is always good & the order is always correct. Large portions so the prices are reasonable. Very friendly staff make you feel welcome - every time!I never ate here until last week. I'm picky on the wings, for me they have to have the right sauce and enough meat. Well I came here and ordered the bbq boneless wings and they are bomb! I mean good! The fries are okay too but I think they add sugar on them and that's weird. Other than that it was good. I also tried some of the hawaiian flavor wings but I didn't like them. They kind of tasted like the chinese sweet and sour chicken.I saw the reviews before me when preparing my own. Yikes! I can only assume there's new management now. 

I brought my car in for a whatever-mile tuneup. They did a quick check before bringing it into the service bay, found out they were out of stock for my model's oil filter, asked me to come back in 2 days when their reorder was scheduled to arrive. 

I told them I needed fluid levels checked now, and would return in a few days to complete the checkup. 

They topped up coolant and oil at no charge within 5 minutes, and said they hoped I'd come back when the filters were in. 

I'm going back this week - the filters are in - and will update this review for better or worse as things fall out. 

But for now, I'm a fan.From 4-6 PM every single day of the week, you can go and forget that bitch, Lady Luck, totally ditched you at the baggage carousel, that you lost this month's mortgage at the Craps table, and that the "hot" slot machine you sat with for so long was nothing but a tease. Because from 4-6 every day at Sushi Roku, you can pretend that you're a high roller, order a large Kirin beer, a spicy tuna roll, a shrimp tempura and jalapeno roll, an order of spicy prawns and chips, and a mini chocolate volcano cake off the Happy Hour menu. And when you get the bill that's less than $20, you can feel like you've just hit the progressive jackpot. Except that you are still leaving with an even lighter wallet. But at least you don't have to worry about paying that pesky winnings tax.Small vanilla soft serve with chocolate crunchies... LOVE Carvel!I like Vons most of the time.  Their produce is hit and miss sometimes though.We stayed there this past weekend while my husband had an r/c world cup championship boat race. The rooms were spacious & we liked the fact there were kitchens in each of the rooms. Only issue was the room keys kept deactivating. Also, hopefully this resort will get in more business, the village shopping & restaurant area was like a ghost town. A lot of the shops were vacant. Kinda sad since the resort is beautiful!Excellent service! Started with the lobster bisque. For my entre, the filet and lobster with a side of the potatoes romanoff. I wish I could remember the martini the waiter recommemded because it was good. Priced about the same as every other Vegas steakhouse....but come here for the quality and service. Had dinner before watching PeepShow (very convenient, next to the theater).You must check it out if you head to Vegas. During the day it's just a roof with holes to let the sun in, but when the sun goes down, it is transformed into a giant tv screen spanning 2 blocks. The site says 6pm, but they didn't turn the lights and music until about 7:30pm. The last show is midnight. 

The music stays the same, but the graphics and presentation change. Last year's theme was more 70's while this year's was themed more like the 80s.

The activities to do around here are very touristy, but you can see a lot of the older casinos. After all, this is the original Vegas Strip. Along with the casinos, they have the Fremont ziplines and the Neon Sign museum.  They also have a stage where some bands were putting on FREE concerts.went here today for lunch.  and as usual its good stuff!!!
had a charbroiled pork bahn-mi and a nice hot steamy bowl of the beef pho.  nothing like boiled cow parts, noodles and broth on a cold winter day.
prices are very fair, service is terrible, but to be expected in a place liek this for the price. ill be back!Restaurant here has really improved its menu.  Added raw foods selections, Latin vegan from Chef Mayra and new vegetarian specials.   Fresh juices, the green goddess pita and meatless burgers are still there w/gr8 salads and an improved dining area.  Service is sometimes slow but you can call your order in advance.I live on the East side of Las Vegas and although there are Clark County Las Vegas libraries closer to where I live I prefer to go here to study and get some school work done. It's not the biggest library out there and I agree the collection is not as big as LVCCLD but this library is a great alternative if you want to avoid the craziness of a bigger library.I had the first Jersey mike's sandwich in LA and loved it... the meats are always freshly cut and the veggies they have are perfect for a sandwich. 

Had the sandwich again the next day and it keeps getting better day by day.. good Sandwich. So long SUBWAYI like dinning here.when I go to vegas.  Its good for family and its not too crazy or trendy.  I like their steak and lobster.  The only thing i didnt like is that their wine selection and the fact that the waiter is always try to recommend very expensive wine. I love wine but i don't like spending 100-200 for a bottle when they only cost about 30-60 at the market.  I wish they had a cheaper selection of wine so I can enjoy it with my steak.  That's why you have to go eat your family so they can pay for you.  Haha.  But expect 100+ per person with a glass of wine.This mall has everything for everyone. From the upscale department stores, to the basic everyday mall stores, this is a great stop for anything and everything. 

Though it is a bit of a walk from the heart of the strip (and a semi-tough drive depending on traffic), it is a must for those early mornings/afternoons when you just don't feel like hitting the tables or the pool.I love cigars, therefore I love going places where you can smoke them. After running across Casa Fuente in the Forum shops I had to drag the wife in there. 

They have a healthy selection of their own label cigars in the humidor, from around $10 at the cheapest to some of the more expensive at around $200. I settled for a cigar for around $20 and it had a smooth, medium smoke and finished great. 

The sales staff in the humidor weren't that helpful on choosing,  but that was all right since I mostly knew what I was looking at. They offered to cut it for me and even light it if I wanted them to (I didn't!).

They have a nice  cafe-like area out in the Forum shops themselves and it was nice sitting out there and smoking, having a little drink (Casa Mojito) and just relaxing doing some people-watching. I can definitely see myself coming back!Wonderful pastas and wines with a view of Lake Las Vegas, their version of the Ponte Vecchio and gondolas.  Lovely place for lunch.  Great service with charming waiters.Disagree with previous reviewer.  Robertos's is as good and solid chain/over-the-counter Mexican food restaurant as you're likely to find in town.  It's fresh, they prepare the food with real ingredients after you order it, it's open 24 hours, what's not to like?

This particular location seemed cleaner and nicer than a few others I've been in around town.  

If you're a carnivore, I highly recommend the Carne Asada burrito.. great flavor, and not at all lacking anything in terms of how much steak you get!We rented a 44' patio pontoon boat for the day for 12 of us. The boat was great. It had a bbq and slide. We had lots of fun. We went down to "The Narrows" and in to a couple coves and also beached at the sandy beach. It was a pretty good price as total rental including gas was $720 USD so it was $60 each. They did say we did a good job on fuel use though. The rental was from Forever resorts.

The reason I docked a star was that the speaker system on the boat wasn't working and we didn't find out until we were already on the lake. Fortunately we had a couple electrical engineers with our group and were able to determine which wires were loose and got it working.We stopped because of the reviews very accurate very good. The place is small not many seats. I had the turkey my wife had the roast beef both were very good. The only thing I did not like was the bread could've been better tasted like a large hot dog bun.
We will be back!You walk into the smell of a real pizzaria, there was a little TV and some teenagers playing nintendo on the floor, kinda like a pizzaria living room.

I went here to pick up a pizza to go, not calling ahead I made my decision a taco pizza, ordered a coke pulled up a booth for a while.

Things were somewhat quiet, then a rougher looking couple came in sat down ordered their pizza with a coupon and brought their own drinks "yikes..things seem tougher in vegas"  

Anyways, I was really impressed with how the owner handled these guys, called them right out on "so you think you can just bring your own drinks into a restaraunt"  words don't do it justice, but it was priceless and handled perfectly.

My taco pizza in retrospect was a poor decision, although delicious, it only left me wanting a turkey taco grinder...

I would recommend this place for its great food and genuine atmosphere, maybe during the day only for families though...

When in vegas again I will be back for my grinder!Consistent service every time, rarely much of a wait and fair prices.Since it was 111 degrees outside, my friend and I really didn't want to ever exit the Luxor (where we had a package of two nights / Criss Angel tickets - which BLEW CHUNKS) so we got tickets to see Carrot Top. 

Even though he's obviously done this show a million times (300 times a year, he said) he was still funny and he made himself crack up, which makes me crack up. His props are super silly and I find that right up my alley. I'm a educated, professional woman with the sense of humor of a college frat boy (ooh, that should be my yelp description).

I would see this show again!I have had a few alterations done here, and they have had my clothing ready for me the next day.  Very efficient, reasonable, and the alterations were perfect.**This review is for drinks only**

For me, Mix is the perfect place to go to start off the night or if you want a chill place.  It's relatively relaxed, no line and cheap cover.  It's typically pretty easy to get a drink, and you can finally get a breath of fresh air out on the patio (if you need to take a break from the air-conditioning and recycled air).  Considering that it's more of a bar than anything else, I think it's a little ridiculous that they charge cover...but I guess every place in Vegas charges cover!We came here Friday night for a friends birthday. We made reservations ahead of time, but we were running extremely late, so we gave them a call to let them know we would be there soon. When we got to Mandalay, we couldn't find it for the life of us, and finally, we were directed to TheHotel. The elevator was extremely scary because I felt like I was going to fall straight down. The view was very nice, but we did not get a window seat since we had a big group.

I shared the tuna tartare appetizer with a friend. It came with taro chips and guacamole. Very tasty! For the entree I had the Atlantic Cod. The croutons in it were so good, then again, what isn't when it's drenched in butter right? The cod was cooked perfectly, moist and flakey. The sauce was buttery and had capers in it. If you don't like capers, I still suggest you get this dish because you can't taste them, probably because the butter masks the flavor, but still very tasty. And for the record, I like capers (Thanks Tiff L.).

For dessert, we were all too stuffed, but the birthday girl ordered tiramisu and our waiter got down on one knee and serenaded her. So sweet! The service was extremely good and they don't make you feel awkward like most nice places do. In the end, they gave us complimentary freshly baked madelines with nutella sauce. They were still warm and in the tin! LOL, yum.

The next time I come back I definitely want to try the foie gras, gnocchi, and the beef tenderloin.

Best of all, the prices are not bad.

I will be back Mix!We love Home Plate. We are repeat customers. The pizza and garlic knots are delicious. We have only had 1 bad experience and that was with service. It took 45m to get our check and we never got 1 refill. But we have not seen that server there the past couple times we have been there. We always recommend this place and can't wait until our son grows up and we can play all the arcade games!Panera Bread, although a tad overpriced in my opinion, is a decent place to a grab a quick bite to eat. I am not going to say they are a healthy option compared to other "fast" type eateries because I don't think everything on their menu is really promoting great health. However, it is a step up from a burger and fries combo at McDonald's. 

This Panera is a staple of The District, sits directly facing the parking lot and is conveniently located. The establishment is large and spacious, which is good, because anytime I have been here the place has been steady with patrons. Customer service is good, although I always get hit up to get their card, which I decline, because I don't go to Panera enough to warrant getting the card. Plus, all in all I am kind of fed up with this every freakin' place I go wants to give me some card deal. Hrumph. Anyway.

Food - I ordered the Chipotle Panini and my husband ordered the Smokehouse Trukey Panini. Both came out deliciously melty and warm, pressed perfectly. I received mine with chips, my husband got a cut up apple, so we shared. Overall loved the paninis. We also ordered a yummy blueberry muffin which was dense and flavorful. 

Quality vs. price - Again, as stated above I feel Panera to be overpriced. I got two combo paninis (which do not come with a drink), one small drink, and a muffin, my total came to almost 20 bucks. The paninis are on the smaller side, so the price value does not exactly match the quality and quantity of what you are receiving. However, the taste is good.

So you have to fight your battles with fast, convenient, "healthier" food. Of course I will return to Panera Bread in the future. I just wish it did not hurt my wallet so bad.This place is our second home! 

First off don't expect Mexican food. Salvadorians speak spanish but do not cook the same way. 

The pupuas are great. It almost like pita bread stuffed with cheese, pork, loroca are a combo of all. 

For breakfast you cannot go wrong with casamiento. Eggs, platnos (Almost like fried bananas) with cream, a mix of beans and rice together and tortillas (that are like pita bread, that is Salvi style). 

That with a cup of coffee or ensalada (fruit drink) will definitely fill you up. 

And if you are looking for a deal, this is it. 2 people and the bill is under $20.00. 

If you don't speak Spanish don't worry, they are very nice and understanding when you order.the drinks were good,the food was good. the dinners were enough to share. 2 couples we got 3 apps, and 2 entrees, 3 veggies and each had 2 drinks and our bill was $150-ish + tip. the food was good and the service was really good. cant remember the name of the wairtess (tall blond) she was great!! she gave us suggestions that were good!!I love stopping at this place because it's not pretentious and it's not packed but there are still fair amount of people here. Live bands and great beer. Drinks are a little expensive but it's Vegas....We wanted good food and that's what we got! The service is friendly and the decor is nice. Plus at 9pm there's live music. I ordered the beer cheese dip with assorted breads... sooo good! I think there chicken pot pie must be good because the table next to me was raving about it. I got the shepherds pie since the waiter preferred it. It was tasty without a doubt but something tells me the chicken pot pie is the real winner there with a creamy tomato base and fluffy pastry topping. It's large portions there so sharing an appetizers is recommended.There's not much I can say about Starbucks that you dont already know. But one thing I can say about this specific location is that there always fast and super freindly.Two things I learned: 
1. The Cheesecake Factory has prep cooks from 4am-12am every day. Everything they make is made fresh every day. 
2. The Cheesecake Factory is actually somewhat tasty. 

We had a really great server and the food was good and came out fast. Its portions are oversized, absolutely. Like most chains, it is advised to share. 

The cheesecake really is fabulous but I'm not chomping at the bit to return here as it is kind of pricy for  chain food.Conveniently located near Energie and Miss Sixty, this store draws in a lot of the hip young folks.  The store is nicely decorated, and the staff is friendly and knows how to dress.  However, most of the employees don't know much about the products and also different sales processes.It's Starbucks! How can you go wrong?  I love their variety of drinks and treats! 

The service at this location was great! They kept the line moving quickly and did it with a smile on their faces! They did a fabulous job and I'm lucky that this location is just around the corner from me! 

Thanks Starbucks for the morning pick me up!With all of the heavy foods you find in Vegas, it is nice to find a somewhat healthier alternative and at a cheap price. They had quite a variety of different choices along with some of the tastiest rice and french fries I have had. 

It is a place to get a quick bite to eat that isn't a 5$ hotdog and a beer that you get in all the casinos. If you are a vegetarian or vegan this might be the only place on Fremont that gives you more options. The lentil soup was actually surprisingly better than I was expecting.I really love this place, all the specialty cake and pastries are gorgeous and look delicious, there is a lot of them i never tried before which i find very exciting!

I had the banana sponge cake today to go with my tea and it was really moist and buttery, simple yet delicious!

the owner is sooo nice and friendly, I love the fact that they serve your coffee in a REAL mug and not the fake paper one.

You can enjoy your goodies there or to go.

The goodies are more Korean style than European but they have very nice basics such as a beautiful tiramisu.

The establishment itself  is charming and relaxing, this is a "British teatime" type of atmosphere in the heart of Chinatown.

Really unique little place,

A must go!The Trump is pretty rad.

Pros: 
-Beautiful rooms with kitchenette, fridge, jacuzzi tub, 24 hour room service
-Free shuttles to Wynn and Caesars palace that we never waited more than 5 minutes for
-Fashion show mall across the street is awesome
-Cheap for a five star hotel
- "Free" wifi included in the resort fee
- Quiet and smoke free
-free 4pm checkout time if you call the desk! Loved this.

Cons:
-No casino for those who do care
-pool is dead, go to Wynn for a real pool!
-Cost us 6 bucks to use the business center Internet...
-Limited restaurant choices ... I.e. there is like, one really expensive one
-Since it is off the strip views are kind of weird in most rooms.

The Trump is a great hotel for those looking for a luxury experience without a big price tag. We spent most of our time at the Wynn /encore anyway so the shuttle was perfect. Would recommend for sure especially cause I don't really gamble. Not gonna lie pool was disappointing though! Oh well..We've been here before when it was so crowded and overly noisy and just made for a disastrous dining experience. We've also been here when the other diners have been more reserved and understood how to use their inside-voices. Definitely, I prefer the latter; definitely. 

Hana is a good value for the cost of dinner. One can bring in one's own wine, beer or sake which is a terrific deal. I've taken in a flask full of sake, warmed up in my lap, for sake bombers and didn't get any funny looks. The fish is fresh (or at least we've been fortunate enough to not have any freshness issues) and brought out in a timely manner. 

I understand we missed their 2-year anniversary. Bummer. I am happy to see they made it past this threshold. Maybe I'll see you there tonight?I went here a couple of weeks ago as a chaperone for a 3rd grade class.  The same day we were there, there were 2 other schools.  The place was adequately staffed enough to put on a 7 person gunfight.  Most of those volunteers worked elsewhere on the compound (ie the blacksmith and sheriff also did the shootout.)  

The "museum" is quite large, almost entirely outdoors - so do not plan this on a hot and sunny day.   Most of the buildings w'ere deconstructed and shipped there from other parts of Arizona.  All of the buildings have a decent amount of information posted on/near the front explaining the building's origins, history, and use.  Everything from a farm, to a church, to a school, homes, root cellars, sheriff,  cemetery, bakery (worst exhibit imho,) and the list goes on and on.  However, you can't go inside most of the buildings.  Most are blocked off (to preserve the antique items inside presumably.)

Their website is awful.  Don't even bother.  

If you go, as I mentioned, it's all out in the elements.  Beware.  But you can bring your own lunch, which you can enjoy in the town square under one of several giant shade trees.  

My 8 year old son enjoyed it and would like to go back.  However, as a mother of 4 kids, I know more kids will not enjoy this than will -- but it's a great place to take out-of-towners and history buffs.I get to Vegas about 5-6 times a year, and the last time we were in the mood for something different (and not in a casino). Our friend found a review for Hot N Juicy online and we decided to try it out.

The food was great (AND HOT), if you go, be prepared to get greasy and have really good spicy cajun/creole food.

The owners were friendly and made sure we had enough to eat and drink. The timing of all the food coming out was a little off, but I think that will improve with them only being open a couple of months when we went.

The only bad thing for visitors is getting back to your hotel if you don't have a rental car. The taxi situation near Chinatown is not good at nights (especially on weekends). If you have your own car... head west on Spring Mountain Road, and be ready for a good ol' fashioned crawfish broil...Pad Woon Sen - that's all I have to day.... just kidding, I have loads to say. 

First, the Archi's is clean and the staff are friendly. 
Second, the food is yum. After eating there a number of times, my favorite is the Pad Woon Sen. When I'm feeling wild and crazy I get the Pad See Eww. 

The only thing is the spice can vary from time to time. I'm normally a 5, but sometimes it's burns like a 7.I've been going to Casman since I first moved to Vegas. It's a great place.

When we first moved here in 1991, they used to have a teen nightclub called "Club Alternative" I've also been there for conventions, Baseball Games, and concerts!

Most recently it's been for 51's games... Thirsty Thursdays is my favorite night, because they serve $1.00 beer!  However, be ready for long lines. I also like the Fire Work Nights!Casinos are designed to distort the sense of time so that you will spend hours upon hours at the machines, spending your money - this is no big industry secret.  The Strip also rocks the wee hours, especially on the weekends, so there's plenty to do and see.  Fantastic!  What is absolutely NOT fantastic, however, is realizing at 11 P.M. that you haven't eaten dinner, and as a responsible Yelper and lover of snazzy food visiting one of the capitals of snazzy food, a street hot dog will not do.  Several heart-wrenching phone calls to various concierges later, the Venetian informs me that they still have three (gasp!) restaurants open, and to me, Zeffirino sounded the best, so they immediately added me to the books. 

And so it was that in a stroke of fate, my friend and I happened upon a really good restaurant in Vegas, and a very reasonably priced one ($100 for two people - entree for each, one drink, and an appetizer), which is great after reading Yelp reviews of other restaurants talking about dropping hundreds of dollars per person.  We were the last table seated, and they closed the kitchen before we got to dessert, but hey, that was all our fault - though it would have been nice to ask us if we wanted dessert during dinner, just in case.

We started with the sea bass cake on saffron sauce as an appetizer, which was good, not too fishy but nothing too snazzy.  I had the duck, and seriously, I have never been fed so much duck on a plate in my entire life, and I was definitely very pleased with the flavors and the preparation of the dish.  My Dining Buddy had the fettuccine with seafood, which was served in a good but non-threatening tomato sauce.  The wine menu was like a novel (seriously, it had a table of contents), but I selected a very tasty cocktail (Berry Lemonade) from an extensive list of delicious-sounding mixed drinks and martinis.  Aside from the drinks, the menu, though extensive, was nothing mind-blowing from what we sampled, but all was satisfying, tasty, and reliable, even for people who aren't crazy about Italian or seafood.

Especially given the late hour, the service was excellent, and our view of the waterway in the Venetian with the occasional serenading gondolier provided great atmosphere.Roller derby lives!  If you remember either the Great Depression, McCarthyism, or Joanie Loves Chachi, you probably remember roller derby.  Sometimes a serious sport, sometimes a three ring circus, roller derby had pretty much died out by the mid-eighties.  Then, early this century, a new breed of skaters emerged.  All-female teams, skating mostly flat-track and with decided punk personae, revived the sport.  These self named rollergirls now have leagues in over fifty cities.  Las Vegas' own Sin City Rollergirls, aka the SCRG, aka the Neander Dolls, are a new team, formed by Ivanna S. Pankin (you figure it out).  Other players include Trish the Dish, Glam BAMM!, and Lorena Bobbitt.

Now, I remember Joanie Loves Chachi.  And I remember roller derby.  I decided to check them out.  The first time was during a practice session.  Practice sessions are informal affairs; the SCRG outnumbered the spectators, and the most vocal fan was the mother of one of the skaters.  Nonetheless, it was worth a quick visit.

Next came an actual match, versus the Angel City Derby Girls.  If you like to watch highly polished professionals beating the crap out of each other, then you've got to go see...something else.  If you want to see a bunch of quirky but obviously competitive people playing for real, see the SCRG.  It was fun, and after about the first period the rules were easy to follow.

Interested?  Tickets are dirt cheap, and their schedule is on their web site.Ambience = A++; It really is a beautiful setting and the perfect place to go when the weather turns nice.  We even drove around the neighborhood a bit to get the lay of the land.  I hadn't been in that area since it was all farmland in the 80s.  

Food = B; We both had burgers.  There really wasn't anything special about them, which is not to say they weren't good... they were.  I'm more than willing to go there again and try something different - something more "authentically Joe's".  The fries were again, unimpressive.  The drinks were a little on the bland side; my first go was a Dr. Pepper which was flat.  

Service was relatively quick for how many people were there.  My husband said the bathrooms were pretty awesome.Good fresh salad bar with a nice selection of soups. Can get crowded and loud during peak times. Join the email list and get weekly discount coupons sent directly to your inbox every week.closedThis place makes the best fried burrito. I got the combo with the pinto bean burrito and the mexi fries (tater tots). My sister had the crispy beef and her husband the tacos which were all excellent. Try it!One of the best places for lunch in town.  My favorites are the Havarti and Asparagus sandwich and the Thai Chicken Wrap.  It can get busy around lunch time but that's a good sign.  DO NOT MISS THE BAKED GOODS!  They are some of the best in town.  Their former location was a bit cuter in decor and more intimate so it doesn't get a full 5 stars from me but I would definitely recommend Bertha's!Road this once in the summer of 2007 when we were staying at Mandalay Bay and this ride was some surreal trippy 2AM ride when we were walking the strip a couple hours before our plane ride back home and it was still like 80 degrees outside.

I felt like I was Keanu Reeves in Scanner Darkly that night after we ate at some McDonalds at some plaza on the strip.  Bright lights everywhere...Flashing lights...Everything was moving...Everyone was looking at me...I could see everyones next move before they even made it...I could see into the future...Everything was so vivid...No detail gone to waste...OMG...I AM TRIPPING!!!  OMG...I WAS TRIPPING!!!

I probably should've gambled that night.  Maybe I would've been able to know what cards were before they were even dealt.

Thank you for helping me not walk the strip much longer that night.  T'was an experience not to forget.  T'was an experience not to relive.I never thought I would become one, but alas...I have become one: a Sprinkles fan.  What the heck.  Before ever setting foot in a Sprinkles store, I had this image that it was for rich Beverly Hills types who had all the money in the world to spend on ridiculous things like cupcakes, but after actually going to Sprinkles (again and again), this place grows on you (or you on it), and you discover that its sweet cupcake love is available to all.

I'm not gonna lie.  First time I tried it, I was like, What's the big deal?  It's good, but it's not great.  And then, after a week or so, I was like, I want to go again and try a different cupcake.  So I go, I try, I like, and then, another week goes by, and I somehow find myself back in line at Sprinkles, eyeing the day's cupcake flavors and trying to make a decision.  It's a sick, somewhat pricey ($3.51 for one cupcake), fatty cycle, but I wouldn't have it any other way.  

Also, Sprinkles does great things occasionally, so be on the lookout at their website or on azcentral.com.  This past weekend, they were doing a charity event where all red velvet cupcake proceeds went to Haiti relief (no guilt!), and the weekend before then, they were giving away free red velvet cupcakes if you wore an AZ Cardinal t-shirt or hat.  Great cupcakes + great ideas = bliss.

PS: Give the banana cupcake more love.  If you like bananas, you will NOT be disappointed by the banana cupcake.  It will treat you right.  I highly recommend it.I don't do much shopping here, but I have been to the V Variety Theatre and the Saxe Theatre several times.  The only store I regularly go to is Sur La Table.  I could just look at all the cooking things there for hours.

I also enjoy going there to people watch.  It's interesting to observe the tourist in its natural habitat here in Las Vegas.  They wear shorts even when it's 60 outside.  They go without coats in the middle of winter.

The Miracle Mile Shops provides me with a great space to do this people watching - right under the glittery mask.  I also go to the Coffee Bean and use their free wifi.

There's much to praise the Miracle Mile Shops for.  It is a neat place!I ate here once w hubby after we wandered around Whole Foods next door...I was starting to get cranky and nasty. Hubby knew it was time for me to be fed.

I was hungry and completely demolished my plate. I don't even remember what I ordered. It was rumored to be brisket, but I was so hungry I didn't check twice. I left with a happy belly. Food tasted good, but the overall impression of the place was, "It's not that big, it's clean enough and the portions were pretty big."

I became a fan, but hubby said his food wasn't so good and had no desire to come back and give them a second chance. Boo. :( Pity because we live so close to them.The gyros are first-rate! Pricing in line with other Greek places. Service is quick n friendly.Being a huge fan of Chicago, and the cuisine it creates, I'm always on the prowl for a good Chicago style pizza or hot dog. I stumbled into Johnny's one day on accident after being disgusted by Z Pizza and I'm glad I did. They do the single best reproduction of the true Chicago hot dog I've had in Phoenix. Perfect bun, dog, relish, onions, sport peppers, celery salt, tomato, and pickles. There is no ketchup to be seen, which scored some big points in my book, until I looked around the corner and saw it was served but with french fries... I guess I can let it slide. Johnny is a nice guy and serves great dogs. Can't beleive nobody has reviewed this place yet...Deals were found thru out. Its good to see more booths were staffed then not. It's all new stuff so if your looking for pre owned or tools go to the outdoor one. It's a dollar to get in. The mini donut Booth is gone but plenty of places to eat are open. Security is present so don't try it. It's goof to come here on hot 100 plus degree days. Grab a smoothie and wall around.Long live China Gate! If there was a mecca of Chinese food for me in Arizona, it was China Gate which was torn down in the construction of Metro Center to make way for a Petsmart, Bed Bath and Beyond, Subway, Blockbuster, and Starbucks. No joke.

It was finally resurrected in a strip mall (by another Starbucks) on the west side with a shorter menu and much better atmosphere then ever before. It is located in this satellite piece of the strip mall right at the corner of the intersection. 

It is still a nice place to eat even though its in a strip mall because of some great interior design. Although the floorplan of the place is a little awkward with a bar area and dinning room with a big tv when you walk in and another dining area down the hall. They have the equipment to do karaoke in the front section on the tv, but I don't know if they ever actually do it unless you have a party there.

But the food is the best part. It is on the Americanized side but you are eating Chinese food in Phoenix, AZ. It's hard for me to get anything other then the Mongolian there which is incredible. Most people get it with Pork, but it is also awesome with their deep-fried tofu. They also have awesome spring rolls, but they aren't quite as good as they were when they were China Gate.

They have lunch specials still but they aren't as mind-boggling as they were at China Gate. At china gate, you got a full dinner plate, fried rice, soup, and an egg roll for 5.50. Now you get a slightly smaller sized main dish, rice, soup, a tiny salad with sesame dressing, and some wonton action for like 6.75. 

But still overall, its one of the few great independent places on the west side along with Mike's Rigatoni Bistro and Touch of Thai.I love coming to Pink. The atmosphere is so comfortable and all of the instructors are down to earth, strong, confident women and they make everyone feel welcome. I've done several of the classes but the pole aerobics is my favorite. It's a killer workout and it's so fun. The studio just recently moved and they are still getting settled but it doesn't take away from the point of the visit; getting your booty kicked (and popped )I have had intentions to come here for a long time. The reviews have been suspiciously good, and I felt that I needed to know why. But, it isn't all good so I will try provide the lay of the land. 

The good
It's a two room bar that has both room and potential. It's a classic dive that gives a homey feel to regulars. They have a happy hour, but it is not needed due to the very reasonable prices on a normal night. Ex. I ordered a Captain and coke, and the lady asked me if I wanted a tall or a short. I ordered a tall and that was 5 bucks. Now you might ask, how much rum can there be in a $5 cptncoke, and I claim 'enough'. This impressed me so much that I stayed for another one. 

The other part of the bar have craft beers and I need to check that out on my next visit, because there will be a next visit for sure. The bartender lady was nice and clearly the caretaker of the regular day-drinkers. 

The bad
I knew where this place was, and when I parked in the back I wasn't sure I wanted to go in. I didn't know if I wanted to park my car here. The people that roam this plaza is of the seedy type and that is not something I like. But this bar has been around for a long time, and I am sure that the area has changed during that time. I will give it the benefit of the doubt. 

The unknown
I haven't been here late at night. I need to. I want to check out the true clientele of this place, and not just the time-passers. They have bands that play here, I don't know how good they are or how wild it gets. This is another thing I have to figure out.We are doing low-carb and the salads here are very good...  

The ahi salad is VERY good, and my husband enjoys the Cobb (no blue cheese and avocado on the side) he gets ranch, and it is quite tasty, and I get the avocado, YAY!   

Have you had Ahi down the street at Hank's in GVR?  Sadly, or wonderfully, the ahi at Sierra Gold far surpasses the ahi at Hank's....  for many $$ less, go figure!  

The beers are cold, and the service at the tables is good as well.  Not too much, not too little...  We usually see the same servers so they know us, but tonight we had a new server and she was equally as attentive, and got us our happy hour beers before the end of happy hour, so of course... we were happy!I have had just about everything on the menu. And it has all been so tasty!  I am never let down. The wait staff is always super nice, helpful and educated onthe menu. I would highly recommend eating there. And try it all. You won't be let down. And always check out their specials. They always have them and they are always awesome!!  The owners are great guys and really care about their restaurants and that shows vigorously throughout the food and the people.if you haven't been to the real eiffel tower.. this is as close as you can get! but of course, it is NOTHING like the real thing.

the lines are long.. so make sure you have a snack with you while cuddling with your loved ones!!

once you get onto the observation deck.. walk around! take pictures! turn off those flash.. to capture the lights of the famous vegas strip!  stay a bit longer!! to witness the bellagio fountain show from up top with their lightings!!! it's so pretty!!I went up during the day ($10 during day, $12 at night). It was super busy so the wait ended up being about 45 minutes, but I liked it up there and ended up staying a bit longer than the rest of my elevator group. The wind felt good on my face and I got a few nice pictures of the Strip (and the traffic on the Strip....).

I just wish the Bellagio fountains had their show when I was up there (instead of just before). I think I would have enjoyed that.When I left Arizona six years ago, the craft beer scene consisted of Papago Brewery and Four Peaks. I would never complain about either, but there just wasn't much going on. After a recent visit, however, I found that there are not only a ton of new breweries but pretty awesome beer bars as well. Bravo, Arizona.  

My visit just happened to coincide with AZ Beer Week (seriously) and Boulders on Broadway had an impressive lineup of drafts for the occasion.The day prior, they had tapped Dogfish Head 120 Minute IPA, something that beer bars in San Diego only dream about. They also had a bunch of seasonals and local beers that I would never be able to get back home.

After a few beers, I wanted pizza, my significant other did not... but this caused no problem at all due to their "personal" sized pizzas.  Genius!  Why don't more bars do this? Life is great when you're not arguing with friends about topping choices. 

I only wish this place was around when I was in college. No offense to Devil House (RIP), but chugging penny beers until someone broke the seal (literally, tape covering the bathroom door) just doesn't seem to measure up.This place is very close to my new house. So I thought I would give it a try. I am always looking for new and good places in the new hood.
I came in and asked ,what is the price to hem pants. I wanted to get my uniforms hemmed as they come to us unfinished. 
Only $12.00 which I thought was very reasonable. I had only taken one pair in because, you know you have to test the waters.
 Well, I was in no hurry to have them done so a few days later I came in to pick them up. I tried them on and they were perfect. I am very happy. 
I also asked about the dry cleaning prices for bed covers. Very reasonable also.
So when I have a chance I will be back here to get the rest of my uniforms altered.
 Mon thru Friday is 8-6, and Sat. 8-4. Closed Sunday.I'm a huge fan of Belgium beers--based solely on their beer selection, Brasserie V would be 5 stars. However, their food is pretty inconsistent and, at times, very mediocre. They have a different lunch and dinner menu--the lunch being my favorite of the two with some pretty fantastic sandwiches (the apple and provolone is my favorite). The one consistent thing on the dinner menu is the mussels and frites. They're hands-down the best in Madison. Paired with a Belgium beer or two, and you've got an amazing night out. The vibe in the restaurant is great--busy and lots of energy. However, the wait & bar staff is pretty hit-or-miss. Overall, really great--but not perfect.Was here for Ballet Under the Stars on 9/24, which was hosted at the outdoor ampitheatre on the lawns (300+ attendance).

Beautiful architecture and public space - great nighttime views of the Mill Ave. bridge from lakeside walkways overlooking Tempe Town Lake, outdoor fountains, spacious lawns. Perfect to catch a concert or view the exhibit collection and a leisurely stroll along the lake afterwards.

The Center has both a 600-seat theatre as well as a 200-seat studio and hosts diverse, multi-media programming as well as ongoing exhibitions.
The Center is well laid out with plentiful parking, including overflow lots at Hardy/Rio Salado.Ohhhh yes I like me some bar food wings. Bartenders are all hot too kinda like the wings. I got great service and good food. Their menu has some cool stuff I would like to try too. It is a regular gaming bar but I like the contemporary modern music. It is dark in there but upbeat.  The average age is a younger crowd from what I saw. No complaints and no issues here!Espresso's changed.  I believe it's under new management, and some menu items are gone all together.  First, they no longer offer wine at all.  My favorite coffee drink, the Viennese, is gone.  However, they still have the Scotch breakfast, as well as the tea lattes I loved so dearly, virtually unchaged.  Table service still exists, though my Macchiato was served in a glass already made in one glass, instead of one glass of milk, the espresso shot in a shot glass, biscotti, and water.  It's possible that it was done that way because I ordered it iced, though.  Coffee itself was impeccable, with the right strength and not burned at all.  Really enjoyed the Nutella waffle, and at $3.50 the price was right.  The TV had sports on, and the music was less synth and more indie rock.  Not sure what to make of it overall, but I'd return for the drinks.  Definitely a place to grab a coffee and snacks and stay for a while still, though.  Between this and Starbucks, I'd rather go here, naturally, but not by much.Jalape√±o Inferno is now a great new addition to my list of lunch spots close enough to the airpark to not be absurdly late for work! I recently went here for a team lunch after doing a little research and was pleasantly surprised by how good things turned out. 

The chips and salsa were great, but the salsa lacked that gritty (I'm in a hole-in-the-wall) flavor that I truly love. The spiciness is toned down a little more than I like too, but the flavors were very tasty,especially their version of a spicy selection. The chips though, that's where they got me... Some of the chips are regular corn chips that you would expect in a Mexican restaurant (but with quality) and the other chips were just cuts of tortilla that were deep fried! I couldn't stop eating them!

For my real lunch, after eating more than enough calories in chips, was Courtney's Favorite Burrito Inferno with chicken. It was off the very hot portion of the menu. The chicken inside the burrito was awesome. It was nice and blackened before being chopped up for my burrito and I could tell. The burrito itself was topped with Inferno sauce and hatch chiles, and it totally won me over. It wasn't the best burrito I've ever had, but I'd be lying if I didn't say it was really good. I also got to try some of the Mexican pizza. If you can imagine what good nachos taste like, you'll understand the flavor, but now imagine that feeling of the perfect bite when eating nachos throughout eat bite! The Mexican pizza at Jalape√±o's calms down your brain's instant guilt trip by rewarding your taste buds with a  perfect bite every time.

Jalape√±o's was great for lunch and it was great for a group. The waitress seemed a little bit impatient, but next time I visit here I will update and clarify if that was just a fluke. If you're in the airpark for lunch, drive a couple miles north and give this place a try; it ain't bad.Thanks to Groupon we found this place.  It's a nice Mexican joint in North Scottsdale.  Tucked away in the corner of the shopping center, there's no way I could've found it on my own.

After browsing the menu, I ordered:
Queso Crisp, $5
Monster Nachos, $10

The Queso Crisp was pretty good.  Kind of hard to screw up a Cheese Crisp, so I wasn't expecting anything less than good.  The Monster Nachos was very good.  I am a self-proclaimed Nacho-lover...and I'm a fan of their Nachos!

The service was so/so on the night we went...they were packed, so it was understandable.  Overall, pretty good experience.

**TIP** - the parking lot can get crazy packed on weekends, so park in the first spot you find.

Return Factor - 95%After waking up after a long Friday night of drinking and dancing I was starving the next morning. Located downstairs on the casino level @ Planet Hollywood is a place called Earl of Sandwich which served hand's down the best TUNA MELT I have ever had. It's a freshly made albacore tuna salad and melted swiss cheese on artisan baked bread. It was so good that before I called it a night on Saturday, I picked up another TUNA MELT and ate it in our room. Seriously... I think there was crack in there it was so good.So for the first food trip of LV 2011 is.................Earl's! Huh?  Not a buffet???!  Nope...we were hungry, in a rush and wanted to spend less than $10.

Located right in the Miracle Mile Shops and PH Casinos....I'm glad I get to experience this place the first chance we get because every time we walked past them since...it's been long lines and packed packed packed.  The lines are so ridiculous long that my buddies and I termed it....Loser Lane....hehe....where you lost big in gambling....trying to get cheap food/kill time at the same time :)

I ordered the Roast Beef sandwich with horseradish cream sauce and veggies.  I tend to always order the Roast Beef at every new sandwich shop I go to...so this place is no different.  Add into the fact that most of the crew ordered their special or the Italian....so I chose to be different.

All I can is...my sandwich is juicy..tender...tastes great with the creamy horseradish sauce all for under $10.  I wished the portion was bigger though...and...well....let's just say the rest of the night of drinking hit me harder than it should because there's not enough food in my tummy :(

Overall, pretty good sandwich to check out if you are sick of buffets, trying to kill time and don't want to gamble.I'm pretty sure this place is open 24 hours? We came at 2am and the place was about half full. Honestly, take all the reviews with a grain of salt... When I wanted to go to Ike's in SF, my friend told me not to because "how can a sandwich be THAT good?!" "Maybe because I LOVE sandwiches???" I thought, but in hindsight, really... how CAN a sandwich be that good??? Didn't like how there was no choice for bread, and you have to get white, but it was still nice and toasted =) The Hawaiian BBQ chicken would be my recommendation but from what I've heard, you can't go wrong ;)It's their bread that makes their sandwich awesome. I got the tuna~ but I'd recommend you get chicken or something else~ since tuna has nothing but tuna and cheese.I love this place 24hrs and the food is good. Good prices especially for vegas. 

I would not suggest getting the broccoli cheddar soup not that great quite watery and no flavor added. My boyfriend had the chicken tortilla soup he loved it. The look of the chicken tortilla  soup reminded me of the one chillis sells I don't eat chicken so I couldn't tell you if it taste the same but he seemed to really enjoy it.Okay, so we finally made it to Sauce. and we were mostly happy with our experience. 

Sauce is an Italian themed pizza and sandwich place that serves wine. Currently, they are running a summer special of: two glasses of wine, one large salad and one personalized pizza for $20.00.  A GREAT DEAL!

Since our first visit earlier this summer, we've been back a few times and the food has been universally good.  

For some reason, we go around 4:30 or so on Thursdays or Fridays afternoons before a movie and the place is usually half full. The downside in going at this time is that Sauces is full of screaming infants or toddlers with indifferent supervision (see photo). 

We have seen very few male parents at Sauce, but mostly young mothers who are meeting with other Moms for a play date at the restaurant. For the most part the Moms will take five or six tables at the far end away from the cashier, but the noise can sometimes be overwhelming. Also, the three and four year olds are known to sometimes escape from their prison with pasta soaked hands . 

So, go for the food, but avoid the Mom's section in the back, and don't wear white!

Okay, you've been warned.I got a call from a friend the other night that a new sushi bar had opened across from her  local laundromat. Not knowing exactly what to expect from a sushi bar called "SakeBomber" I diligently made my way down to Tempe to check this place out, hoping to find another great sushi happy hour (which runs Monday through Friday 5-7 p.m. as I write this review).

I definitely got the nightclub vibe from SakeBomber. It was low lit with colored lights lighting the bar, there were flat screen TV showing sports and hip-hop music playing just slightly too loud (perhaps they're taking a page from the Ra play book).

There was no wait for a table during the Wednesday night happy hour. I ordered edamame, a crispy california roll and a spicy salmon roll. My friend got a spicy tuna roll and a crispy eel roll. While we didn't do any SakeBombs (hey, you wanted a legible coherent review right?) we did enjoy some $1 warm sake.

I'd love to write you something more descriptive here... but all I can really come up with is that "the sushi was pretty good." I enjoyed it, but it didn't knock me off my feet (although the spicy salmon was actually spicy, a nice change from most other places I've tried in the valley). The rolls were slightly larger than what gets served at Sushi 101 (what I would classify as SakeBomber's most direct competition). The only problem I have with this is that it gets difficult to get the entire roll in your mouth in one try.

After reading everything above, you might be thinking to yourself, "Why the heck did he give this place four stars?" Price. Although this wasn't the best sushi in the world and I personally didn't care for the atmosphere, as I write this, the happy hour menu is probably the most reasonably priced I've found. Edamame and two rolls during happy hour  was only $11.

I'm definitely going back to SakeBomber... not only do I want to try some things on the non-happy hour menu that looked enticing, continuing to go at happy hour will hopefully keep the sushi monkey on my back from continuing to eat a hole in my pocket.This place looks cool inside and has a fun vibe.  

First the downsides: menu can actually be a little overwhelming, you get the impression the staff is overworked/crazy busy (how long does it take to make tea?) to the point where if there are more than four people ahead of you in line, you want to shoot yourself.  Unless you have nowhere to be, ever.  

Upsides: huge selection, fairly helpful staff (paralyzing indecision?  that's what they're there for), ambiance, coolness factor.  

I need to try the food here.First eating here
Reese the bartender was really cool
I loved the food
Had steak and eggs
I definitely will come backDangerous place to shop!  Lots of neat imported goodies, many in sample sizes so you can try them out before buying the bigger size.  I got about 6 different flavors of hot cocoa, a maple sugar candy in a maple leaf shape for me (Michigan thing), and filed away a lot of ideas for gift-buying when I get home.  I might even ask Santa for a gift card to World Market for myself!Great Show but in my opinion I still like O and Ka better. Whatever you do don't pay full price. There are always discount tickets around, you just have to look for them.

This time I was able to find $88 tickets via the Cirque app on my iphone (it just linked to a Mirage ticketmaster site).

I was worried about where to sit but it really isnt an issue. All seats are good and I would argue like others that the cheaper seats towards the top are actually the best seats in the house.Come for HH, it'll allow you to eat more AND save money at the same timeOK so I'm not a big gelato connoisseur or anything. In fact, I don't actually know what makes it different from regular ice cream or what justifies making it more expensive. That said, I did try it here and it was good stuff. 

The best part was the flavor options. There are a lot of them and I'm sure you can find something you like. The fruit ones also seemed to have real pieces of fruit in them and were very strong in flavor but not at all artificial tasting which was very nice. I myself had the coconut flavor and it was really good. Very creamy and thick (clearly not for anyone on a diet. I bet this stuff is made with pure fat) with actual coconut pieces mixed in. I really have no complaints other then, of course, the price. A small was something around $5 and while the portion was quite ample, I still didn't see why it was so much. It wasn't ridiculously expensive but still. I'm probably just being picky though and people who actually know about gelato will tell me that it's so much better then ice cream which is why it costs more. I personally couldn't really tell other then the more creamy texture.  

If you're in the mood for some refined flavors and very creamy ice cream  and don't mind paying more then you would for the regular stuff then I have no problem recommending this place. If however, you want some of the regular stuff for cheaper, go somewhere else.Heard they recently moved to a new location but this was my first time.  We had  a fantastic pizza from the brick oven as a group starter, Turkey club for me, reasonable prices and exceptional service.  It was a 99 degree day and one of the guys in our big party told the food server from the very first, to keep bringing him sodas as he was absolutely parched.  He was a bit over the top on his request (borderline rude) but the server kept pace with it all and his drink was never empty.

Besides the group pizza as a starter I had the Turkey club Sandwich and side for $8.00 which was wonderful, I chose the fries which I normally don't let myself have and they were tasty.  The turkey club sandwich had the right amount of crunchIf you haven't been to this Farmers' Market you are in for a real treat! Prices aren't as good as I thought they'd be at a market, but the quality makes up for it (and most vendors will give you a smokin deal if you buy in bulk). The produce is outstanding- So fresh and tasty!! The farmers and vendors themselves are a bonus, too, friendly and generous with the samples, and really sweet with the little ones. Look out for Great Harvest breads- we bought a loaf of carmel apple bread and we can't stop eating it! It is soft and moist, and has little chunks of chopped apples and carmel.

I wish there were a little more variety- the produce is fresh and bountiful, and the food vendors have some great things (look for the pulled pork and green chili breakfast burrito, oh mannnnn they are awesome!), but I wasn't so impressed with the crafts. Hopefully there will be more as we near the holidays. Most of what you'll find is so-so jewelry, some nice soaps and candles, and tie dye.

The parking is kinda crazy, but you can drive around to the back of the park and park on the street. Hardly anyone parks there and you get a nice walk along the pond and through the playground. Beautiful way to spend the cooler mornings with friends, your children or walking your dog.Took a cab down to the Stratosphere since it's too far to walk. Had purchased some TravelZoo deal for discounted tickets to the top of the tower. It's a little over priced, but it's cool to see all of Vegas from the 107th floor. There is a bar up top and you can stay up there as long as you want. I recommend going around sunset, as it's a 360 degree view. You can also see the crazy people doing the rides up top or jumping down to the bottom!Best hotel I've stayed at by far!  I was there in the summer with my family.  and we had a room on like the 45th floor.  Sweeping view of the strip.  Amenities are great.  This hotel has about 5+ pools.  Very nice shops.  And is convienient to fashion show mall.  Would love to stay here again!TIP: Kumamoto oysters! And the New England clam chowder (one of the best I've had)!

REVIEW: Although it's not my favorite place to dine for seafood, I have always been a fan of Kings Fish House.  I love that it's located at the District, which has been remodeled and decorated for the holidays--festive!  We came in Sunday night for dinner.  It was not busy at all, and we were immediately sat at a booth.  It took a little while for the server to come by and greet us.  By the time he came by, my boyfriend and I had thoroughly looked through the menu and were ready to order.

Anyway, we ordered, and our server brought us some sourdough bread and butter.  The sourdough bread was fresh and warm--crusty on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside.  For starters, we had a dozen of the Kumamuto oysters, which were not bad.  Served alongside horseradish, mignonette, cocktail sauce and lemon wedges, the oysters were small yet plump, sweet, and creamy--as they were supposed to be.  There WERE a couple in the bunch, however, that were a little on the fishy side... it wasn't enough to ruin the meal though.  I had also ordered the New England clam chowder--so good!  It wasn't thick or lumpy how most chains serve clam chowder; it was perfectly soupy, creamy, and clammy! lol My boyfriend's not regularly a fan of clam chowder, and even he liked it.  For our entree, we had the crab leg dinner special (I forget what kind they were), which came with a pound of crab and two sides.  For sides, I had the vegetable ratatouille and macaroni and cheese, and he had the saut√©ed spinach and cheese grits.  The crab legs were good.  They were thick and had some nice sweet, juicy chunks of meat; I was only sad that there wasn't more!  The shell itself was spiky and a little rough to get through, but worth the work if you really like crab.  The sides were good, but nothing to rave about.  The meal came out to about $140, without tip.  Our server was great though, despite the fact that he was little busy in the beginning.

Overall, Kings Fish House isn't bad.  They've got great reasonably priced seafood.  Plus I hear they have a pretty good happy hour.  Gotta give that a shot next time!i love BBQ Chicken in California and was excited to see the logo in vegas.  It was quite interesting,  they serve the BBQ Chicken here, but its not BBQ Chicken the restaurant.  

It's a cool little korean bar/ bar food type of place.

cool place to chillHere's how a 1-star shopping plaza gets 4 stars.

So it's New Years day last month and we were just finishing up our brunch, bloodies, and a session of watching bowl games at the Grapevine.  A small army of us decided on an impromptu day drinking pub crawl in old town.  It was 70 degrees and a perfect day to stroll.  The only problem was my lady friend (from out of town) left her tennies in the room.  She only had pumps and her dogs were already barkin from the long night preceding.  

So off to Salties they went.  She and I left on a mission to locate some sandals.  I thought snatching up a pair of flip flops would be a no-brainer at Sidewalk Surfer.  Little did I remember that is was New Years Day.  Everyone was closed, even Triangles.  After 2 laps around old town, it looked like it was going to be either the pumps, cowboy boots from one of those awful turquoise stores, or she would have to man up and rock the grocery store feet. 

None of those options sat well with her (I could've handled the pumps, but I absolutely despise dirty feet).  I made one last ditch effort and drove down to Southbridge area.  I only saw one door open at a place called the Garage Boutique.  On a hunch we stuck our necks in and said hello.  Katie, the owner, informed us that she was closed, just doing some admin work or inventory, but offered us to peek around.   Took us about 15 seconds to figure out it was another swing and miss!  It was a children's boutique.

She saw the dismay on our faces and had to ask "what are you looking for".  I gave her the 5-sec version with hopes she could point us in the right direction.  To our surprise, she leaned down, grabbed her own pair of sandals and gave them to Lindsey (aforementioned lady friend).  No joke, they were even the right size.  She said to bring them back when we can.  SCORRRE!!

I couldn't believe it.  Such a solid find.  I offered her money and she wouldn't take it.  I even offered to bring her some bagels or a bento box from Kyoto (I think that creeped her out a bit haha).  I was 2-3 drinks deep and we were fired up at this point.  So we went about our day...yada yada yada.  Needless to say we had a great day thanks to a genuine person helping us out.  The moral of this long rant is that Katie is the shit!  Her boutique is full of cute kids stuff: clothes, all sorts of fresh gear, mother-loving accessories, trinkets, and the like.  Not only does this boutique have some great pint-size threads, but its owner is a enormous sweet heart, life saver, and obviously has great taste.  If you have children, make sure to drop in.  You won't be dissappointed with the service!      

p.s. I only mention the 1-star because most of the tenants & shops are gone.  If you see any shops in the Mix are open, they are definitely worth a looksie.  

Thanks again Katie!It's a chain but a good one. It's been at this location for a long time now, they're still thriving, and it's all for good reason.

There are a lot of great options here but some of my favorites are the catfish po' boy, fried alligator and crawfish boil. One must try appetizer are the saut√©ed frog legs. If you haven't had frog legs before this is a good place to try them. 

They've got great atmosphere indoors, a great patio that typically features live music and the service is always fantastic. A fine choice for lunch ,dinner, drinks or all of the above.This place is pretty great. It's a bit pricey, but from what I tasted, you get what you pay for. I had a "alex-something" dish, and it was amazing. The menu is huge, and if even half of it tastes as good as what I had, then I would definitely recommend this place to anyone. I will be back.It's tough to find breakfast in Vegas, but this is a good spot if you're staying at Caesars. The crepes were tasty, and they have premade yogurt parfaits and stuff if you just want to go cheap and fast. It's right across from Rao's.

There was a conference going on and the line got pretty long, so plan ahead for your time.I am in Las Vegas for work and I love this little restaurant!  Their French toast with berries or the other French toast with bananas and nutella.  OH and the lobster egg benedict on croissants is delicious!  This place is a must go for breakfast, forgot to mention the bacon is nice and crispy.Great music and lounge area. So far it's the one I've really liked compared to other hotels I've been. If you like to just chill n people watch it's definitely a place for you. They also have a dance floor f you wanna get your groove on. I highly recommend chilling there if you don't feel like gambling.I was introduced to San Tan Brewing Company by my niece and nephew. They always know where the good places are and San Tan Brewing Co. was no exception! The food was good, they had TV's and good beer. It is a good place to meet up with friends and family or to have HH with coworkers. It's located in Chandler's Town Square which just adds to the coolness. As you walk in you can see the huge tanks where they brew their own delicious beers. I also like the vintage p.o. boxes that they have converted into benches you can sit on while you wait for your table. Nice touch!Potato Valley Cafe is a lunch spot near downtown, specializing in, not surprisingly, baked potatoes. This place gets mad props for being one of the few black-owned business in the area (the only I know of in my limited knowledge), giving a discount to federal employees, and shelling out some tasty taters filled with copious and interesting combinations of ingredients. I think the veggie combo has around 3 or 4 trillion ingredients in it, including mango (an odd choice, but it works). It sorta works out to be a potato's take on a taco salad, w/ the potato acting as the taco shell. When you've scooped out the fixings in the middle, you can pick up the salted potato skin and enjoy its crispy goodness as a hand-held treat.

Normally I'd give a place like this 3 stars, but I feel compelled to give it 4, if only for picking a simple, yet workable idea and just running with it. The food is good, and that's it -- not great, just good.  But good enough to come back, and better than most of the greasy spoons polluting the area. So this is a 4-star lunch spot, in its class.I liked my food, and the beer I had (the Xingu) was good as well.  I had the brie and prosciutto panini because I was starving and found myself well-filled by the end of the second half of the sandwich.  The ambiance was really nice, the fire, the candles, the couch.  Really a perfect evening all around, especially at half price (for their 1-year anniversary).  The wine list looked a bit expensive, but all-in-all I was pleased with the experience and wouldn't hesitate to return.I like this place a lot, it is cute and cool, but the prices for wine are silly for S. American brands.  Your best bet here is to buy a bottle of something in the $27-$35 range rather than glass at a time for $12-$14.  Then if you don't finish it (you are going to finish it), take it with you.

We do love the back area, its very neat, one of the best patios in Phoenix and they're dog friendly.  Come in the morning for Coffee and Tammie Coe (YUM!) pastries.  They also serve MJ breads for their evening tapa style options.

For food, get an order of Bruschetta, its very nice and they have some very good food for the price.  This is where they shine - not with the wine, which is pretty good, just overpriced.  Their cheese platters are also quite good, well worth it.

Each month they have a wine tasting with Kim Hartleroad, make sure you come in for that.  For $25 you get some nice snacks, 3 to 4 wines to taste and some great lessons from a local wine guru.

Its very nice to have a place for evening tapas and wine as well as great options in the morning with Illy Coffee and Tammie Coe pastries.  They have a great place here, make sure you stop in, day or night!Bomberos for breakfast!

I had the cabeza bagel sandwich with fruit and the man had the chimichura  with spicy potatoes . Both were delicious. It was raining outside so we dined in and the rain and crowdedness created quite a cozy ambiance. Their coffee is excellent too!Came here today to see Little Fockers. Since it was the 1st show of the day I decided to order a Starbucks drink to have while I watched the movie. A large was perfect! Made just the way I like it and it lasted the whole movie. This time I was prepared for it being chilly and had a jacket and wore boots!
I still love those comfy new chairs..Ok, I really liked this place. It's been eight hours since I had lunch there and my mouth is still happy.

My husband and I on a whim, decided to have a rare week-day lunch together and go for some sushi. Wanting to try a new place, we headed over to Sushi Eye.

We were greeted by the owners, a Korean couple, who was very nice and welcoming. Our waitress was very sweet and she was quick to get our orders in and our drinks on the table. By the way, I tried their bottled Ginger Peach Black Tea and it was sooooo good. Not sweet at all, which is how I love my teas, just a natural flavor.

Anyway...

We ordered a side of edamame, which is pretty much going to be good anywhere you go.

Then we ordered four rolls: Cherry Blossom (my fave!), The Elliot, Spicy Scallop and The Atkins.

The Cherry Blossom was soooooo good. I don't remember all what was in it, but I think it was Tuna, avocado and one other item. But it was drizzled with a sauce and coated with Macadamia nuts. I've never seen that before but OMG, delicious!

The Elliot was my hubby's fave. It was eel and it was good, but it was a little sweet for my taste.

The Spicy Scallop was good, but sort of unmemorable. I didn't not like it, but it didn't wow my mouth.

The Atkins was also awesome and different. It was tuna, avocado wrapped in cucumber, but the rice wine vinegar sauce that was drizzled on it put it over the top. OMG, I was licking my lips from that for hours.

Sushi Eye will definitely be a return visit for us.Very good place food was cooked great staff was friendly I would love to go back and try more thingsSeeing as how this was the closest bar to my dad's house when I was visiting, I inevitably ended up here on the first night in town.  There were only a handful of people there, but I just wanted a beer, and O'Donoghue's provided with the on-tap Blue Moon.  Service was fast and friendly.  My biggest complaint was it shutting down early, but I guess that's typical of this part of Scottsdale.I really enjoy this place. From my experience, you cant go wrong at Pin Kaow. 

The service is perfect. They seat you ASAP and the water glass of mine is constantly full. They check-up just enough so you feel remembered, but not pestered. 

Food here is just like Grandma's :) 

Cucumber salad and papaya salad (youre not supposed to eat the crabs, just suck on them for their saltiness, not too much of a fan) are good appetizers. If you're looking for soup rather than salad for appetizers, the Tom ga kai soup is my faveee, and they make it well here.

For entrees I usually get Red or Green Curry. Yummm. I have found that the red curry is spicier than green when ordered on the same scale.  My last visit, I stepped away from getting my usual curries, and got the ground chicken larb salad. It was just as I had expected, almost as good as grandma's ;]. I recommend this dish, I think people stay away from food that they don't know... but larb is ground meet of your choice. Thai basil and cilantro really dominate the dish, along with this it has the standards of onions, and fish sauce. With the ground meat, you put it in cabbage wraps.. mmm. So, you can call it a variant of lettuce wraps. 

My only complaint is the lack of rice they give for the curry... There is so much broth for this and i like to have my curry and rice well proportioned, but they dont provide you enough... I know how the asians hate wasting!! But I dont think it would go to waste if they just gave another scoop. 

I have tried tmy friend's pad thais, pad see ews, and other noodle dishes. I am not too fond of getting these here because I feel that I can get these in chinese take out!

My recent discovery is on Sunday nights they have traditional Thai music, which is relaxing, and dancing performances that are nice to watch. Stop by this place, despite the negative reviews.. try it for yourself:]Everyone has an opinion about good Thai food, and I think Pin Kaow is awesome.

I've yet to eat anything here that was not fantastic. Some of my favorites are the satays, Penang curry and chili mint noodles. The food is legit, but the ambiance and service are spot on too. The servers are very friendly and attentive, and even though Pin Kaow is usually busy when I've been there, I've never had to wait long for the food to arrive. 

Really good for ordering dishes to share family style (if your group can agree on a spiciness level). This is the only Pin Kaow location I've tried, but I'd definitely be open to hitting up the others in the future.Friday...can't eat meat due to Lent.  Luckily, my awesome fiance suggest Pin Kaow.  We ordered

-Papaya Salad: We ordered a 5 out of 10 spicy, gosh it was super spicy.  We were diligent in picking out the shreds of bird's eye chili.
-Tom Yum Goong:  We ordered a 6 out of 10, but it was not as spicy as the Papaya Salad...it was perfect.  When it arrived at our table, I fished out 8 pcs of medium to large size shrimps out  and put them on a small plate.  I realized I do not like overcooked shrimps.  Fishing them out will stop the cooking process.  The soup by far is my favorite.
-Crab Fried Rice: The most delicious crab fried rice, out of all other Thai places that I have tried.  There are lumps of crab meat in this mix.  So good!

At the end of the meal, they bring out a small plate of orange wedges.  

The server wasn't very attentive.  She wasn't so friendly either...but the food is good!Very relaxing atmoshphere.  If you are looking for big pool party you will be disappointed here.  The wife and I went on a Sunday, it wasn't crowded at all (we arrived right at 11), The drinks are priced comparable to other places on the strip, around $8 per beer and $15ish for mixed drinks.  The staff inside was friendly, the door guys seemed a little full of themselves but that is everywhere you go so to be expected.  
Very nice, clean pool.  The water temp was very nice and to our surprise you can now be topless IN the pool which has changed since a couple summers ago.  You can not walk around topless, (to the bar for example) but you can lounge in your chair/area and take a dip in the pool.  Pool temp was very comfortable and refreshing and CLEAN.  If you have been to the other pool parties in Vegas you know what happens when you have 1500 drunk people in a pool...
Very relaxing, people mostly kept to themselves with some light mingling, a small non competitive litle volleyball game with the beach ball... The sun stays on your the entire day but there are places to find shade which makes it enjoyable on our scorching summer days.
Will be back for sure.My family went for brunch today and something went wrong with our order.  The manager on duty came out and took care of it right away. I commend him for his attention to the customer. We will be back for the food and service.It's always pretty, always changing, always open and it's free!  Photo op!!!  Whether you're a local or a tourist, it doesn't matter - we all go here.  For that reason, it can get pretty crowded.

Lots of plants and flowers that make up a figure like ladybugs in the spring, cornucopia in the fall, animals for Chinese New Year, etc.  They have mechanical parts to them so some figures actually move.  They add a water element too like a fountain, waterfall, pond, etc.

Take your kids, mom, girlfriend/wife, daughter, friend here.  They'd love it.  Well, maybe except if they're allergic to certain plants/ flowers.I never thought I would enjoy yoga.  I play ice hockey, enjoy cycling and time at the gym, and was talked into trying out hot yoga.  And I was quickly hooked.  This type of workout compliments the other activities very well.  I have noticed increased core strength and increased range of motion.  I have been to True Hot and Sumits recently, and both are very good.  I like this place better, mainly due to the variety of instructors.

Place is very clean, nice staff, and really only complaint is that sometimes, the 5:30am weekday, and 7:00am weekend class gets too crowded.  I guess that its not their fault that so many people want to get up THAT early for yoga...Mushashi is your typical teppanyaki style Japanese restaurant. When you first walk in, underwhelmed is probably the word that comes to mind. The paint is chipping/dirty, the furnishings have seen their better days, and any decorations that they did have were modest at best. They do have some really cool kimonos on the walls though. Probably to cover a hole in the wall or gang graffiti or something.

The bathroom is a complete disaster. The door didn't lock and the upkeep was... Basically there is no upkeep. I've seen frat houses have cleaner bathrooms. It was pretty gross.

So after all that, I STILL gave this place four stars. Why? The food is that good and the price they charge at happy hour is ridiculously cheap. The food is comparable, if not better, than the much more expensive teppenyaki locations. Literally the cost is about 1/3 or 1/4 what you would spend at Benihanas. The chefs are all very friendly and they put on a fun/funny show, but thats nothing new to this type of setting. 

I do not recommend the sushi here. Stick with the teppenyaki. The uni that I ordered looked and tasted like it was scraped off the bathroom floor. 

Overall, great food and great price. I actually made myself hungry thinking about this place and will most likely go tonight!i had a rack of st louis style ribs, burnt ends and pulled pork combo....baked beans as a side...good tasty bbq but very pricey, for the above with two drinks was $50 .....i would go again next time I am in Sin City........My friend, Heather, and I had a lovely dinner at 1130 on Saturday night. We made unnecessary reservations (don't you just hate that - you make a reservation and the place is empty??) for 5:45 PM because we were seeing ATC's Enchanted April at the Herberger, and I needed to be at the theatre by 7:15 PM. 

Heather had the Raspberry Cosmo and I had the Bellini-Tini (vodka and peach schnapps). Both were delicious!

For dinner, Heather got the Pasta Rustica, and I had the Smothered Chicken. I devoured my meal. The grilled chicken was on rice pilaf and was definitely smothered in a Red Pepper cream sauce. Then, the chicken was topped with goat cheese and spinach. Yum! 

Heather liked her pasta dish too, but she tasted mine and said that next time she'll get the chicken.

While I nursed my one drink, Heather enjoyed a cup of french roast coffee that came out in a French press and smelled heavenly. 

As we walked over to the theatre, Heather commented, "That was a really great meal." 

I agree.I came to Cathouse this past weekend the night after I went to LAX. So my party and I had a chance to directly compare the both of them. I must say that Cathouse beat out LAX for me.

One thing that was great here was the music! Granted this particular aspect may be graded on a curve since i'm not apart of the electro dance craze right now. It was a breath of fresh air to hear some songs you can actually dance/groove to and not just RAGE and jump around like a bunch of semi brain dead cavemen. The lounge offers two floors, and that night 1 was playing electro pop top 40 songs and the other (where I was) some old and mostly new songs that weren't top 40. It was a blend of R&B, dance, and hip hop so you didn't feel like there was the same beat and breakdown in each song -___- haha

This place wasn't too super packed like you will find most LV clubs which I liked! There was enough room for you to walk around and also enough room for some of us to start our own cypher on the dance floor (I'm a dancer), which was AWESOME!!!

One thing that was TERRIBLE about this place but I was able to turn a blind eye to was the bartenders. I'm sure they're probably pressured by the club but the drinks here were unacceptable. Granted the club gave out 2 free drinks coupons to all of the ladies, but still. The drinks had no taste of alcohol. My female friend gave me one of her free drinks (what was supposed to be Cranberry Vodka) and I was literally drinking juice... in the club... But it was no big deal because the music took me over anyway. So if you're one of those people that need to buy drinks at the club, you will be HIGHLY disappointed!

One thing I can say that was great about this place that I almost forgot to mention was the service. We passed by the entrance earlier in the day and the guy working the front spoke yo us and was very informative and easy to talk to. Even the bouncers/security on the inside were nice compared to your typical bouncer. My friend and I were sitting at a booth that I guess was payed for and a bouncer came up to us and politely asked us to stand and that he's trying to sit a party there. We had no problem and was surprised at the generous undertone. Also I remember dancing on the floor calling people into the cypher and I jokingly point at a bouncer waving him in. With no hesitation he goes into a buff man pose and pokes his chest out. It looked pretty silly, but I was surprised at the participation in letting loose a bit!

This review's integrity may be ascue because of the crowd that night as well. Everyone seemed to want to have a genuine good time and could actually groove and connect with music other than primitive mindless fist pumping!! (Ok enough electro dance bashing).

Cathouse! Great music, great vibe, crap drinks, great staff!Good, quality food.  Love the fact that I used to eat at that Taco Bell when I was little.Wanted Mexican food and have eaten at the one in Planet Hollywood and loved it.  This one was not as good as the one in PH, but it was good.  We ordered chips and salsa for the table, which came with 4 different salsas.  I liked the mild and hot red salsas the best.  The food everyone got was great.  Service was quick, ambiance was a little boring inside where we ate.We came here for drinks the inside was spacious with a mechanical bull people were having a great time with that.  The outside patio was nice with the fire going.  The setting was ranch and country-ish but the music was pretty much anything mostly top 40 but the dj was willing to play whatever you request.  I think the DJ was the star of the night he had great music and didn't hang out behind his turntables all night he was having fun with the crowd and engaging people in a good time.Really good foodThis would be a 5 for me except the last time I was here for my company Christmas party we got very poor service. We could not get the servers to come by with more food and when we asked about it we got a very pissy manager. They closed out bar down early and we drink a lot. Really stupid move. I am willing to do it again but they did a poor job of talking care of 40 people.Microbrewery & coffee house? Hello Cartel where have you been hiding all this time!

Some have said if you want atmosphere head on over the Lux, but I think that's discrediting what Cartel has to offer.  Lux and Cartel Coffee are 2 different styles, respect the differences. 

Was in the area and found Cartel by fluke, I was in need of some coffee, yes I can admit I am a caffeine junkie and Cartel was my dealer, from the board above you can tell this a coffee joint (ok they have tea too if coffee isn't your thing).  I went with a Latte, which was perfectly blended with a cute little heart design, so sweet.  

With coffee in hand I gave this place a more through look threw, I like the vibe of it, lots of seating room. I didn't realize it was a microbrewery until I had the coffee in hand; I'm intrigued and need to come back and inspect that soon.

Since Cartel isn't that far from me I'm sure I will become a regular in no time haha.  Glad to find another place to get a good cup a joe.Great food, best Mongolian BBQ I've hadGuru Palace has so many highlights that it's hard to pick just a few.

The lunchtime buffet provides the opportunity to mix dishes, and I'm a huge fan of both their Palak Paneer and Daal, so a lunch trip is always my first choice (even though lunchtime wait service is on the slower side).

Their dinner menu is fairly basic, but I've never had a dish that I disliked.  And while I prefer the veg dishes the most, the Lamb Vindaloo is also very very good.Great food and a good atmosphere!Carnevino is Mario Batali's high-end steakhouse in Las Vegas (located in The Palazzo).  With steakhouses, the first thing people want to know is if the steak is good.  The steak here was very good (some of the best I've had).  Of course, a lot of these high-end steakhouses put out good quality steaks that are cooked to the appropriate temperature.  They tend to struggle with the other menu items though--the starters, sides and desserts.  Unfortunately, Carnevino is too similar to other steakhouses in that respect.

Carnevino is huge and boisterous.  They keep the restaurant pretty dark.  The decor is nice and the seating is comfortable, but the overall look and design of the restaurant is nothing new (or impactful).  They do feature a large bronze bull statue at the front.

The complimentary bread included cheese puffs that were good.  I cannot remember what other bread was served, but it was at least okay.

I started with the big eye tuna crudo, which featured tuna sashimi dressed in a vinaigrette with a side of radish and cucumber salad.  The tuna was fresh and good though it was a very small portion.  Some of it was a little over salted.  The radish and cucumber salad was fresh and crisp.

For my pasta, I had the fruit di mare, which featured spaghetti with a tomato sauce, lobster, squid, shrimp, and clams.  The seafood was a generous portion.  I liked the lobster and the shrimp.  The squid was fine.  The clams were just okay; I've had better.  The clams here were not as meaty and tender as I would have liked.  There was a little bit of grit and sand in some of the shellfish though.

The tomato sauce had a little bit of heat to it, but it was quite thin, watery and bland.  The waiter said that all of their pastas were housemade, but the spaghetti did not taste like housemade spaghetti.  Maybe it was, but I have had better housemade spaghetti at other restaurants.

I tried my friend's pappardelle dish, which was served with mushrooms.  We both agreed that her pasta was a little bland.  The texture of the pasta was good though.  I was not a fan of the pastas at Batali's Osteria Mozza (though the pastas there were not bland but salty).

The main course was good though.  I had a bone-in New York Strip and it had a great char to it.  The inside was nicely medium rare.  It was juicy, flavorful and tender (which is hard to do with a New York Strip because it is lean).

They also offer a dry aged bone-in ribeye for two people.  This ribeye gives new meaning to the word bone-in (check the photos on Yelp to see what I mean).  The ribeye was huge and they carve it tableside.  The ribeye was very good--great marbling, juicy, flavorful, and tender (one of the best steaks I've had).

I also sampled a little bit of the filet portion from the porterhouse.  This was my least favorite of the steaks.  Maybe the filet was too thick because the center of it was kind of bland.

They offer sauces on the side and I tried their wine reduction (Barolo Ristretto), which was oily and had no flavor.

I did not get to try many of the sides, but I did try their creamy mashed potatoes (mixed with mascarpone and a poached egg).  The mashed potatoes were very creamy and flavorful.  The other sides sounded good.

It was my friend's birthday so Carnevino made a big chocolate cake for the occasion.  The chocolate cake was rich and fudgy, but it was just okay.  We also had some of their gelato on the side (chocolate, vanilla and coffee).  The gelato was a little icy and lacked the creamy, smooth texture that is common with gelato.  The flavors were not that prominent as well.

Service was good.  Food came out at a good pace.  We were a large party, but they had a large and attentive staff supporting us.  Before ordering at most restaurants, I engage the server to understand what are the most popular dishes and how are they prepared.  More often than not, I let the server direct me in what to order especially if I sense the server is passionate about the food.  Here though, the waiter was a little pushy.  As soon as we sat down, he was directing us on what to order, how much we need to order and so forth.  Service was still good, but the waiter was just not for me.

Carnevino's meat was very good and unlike several Las Vegas restaurants I've dined at, I walked away satisfied.  Prices here (like other Vegas restaurants) were pretty steep, but at least I felt that the main food here (steak) would match up well with some of the other very good steak places I've tried, which makes Carnevino a good Las Vegas option for steak lovers.

By the way, my friends said they saw Mario Batali (he was eating with John Cusack near the bar).

The Palazzo has complimentary valet parking.  I would imagine like other major casinos that they have complimentary self-parking as well.Just happened to stop by here to try something a little different. Nothing local is around where I live, so I'm always going to the same coffee places. This was a nice change of pace. I got an Americano and I was great! Try this place!While we are not NYC by any means and do not have bagel shops on ever corner, of the few we do have, Einstein's hits the sport every time. Just by the shear number of checkin's alone I guess that defaults me to having to click the 4 star, Yay! I'm a fan, for this yelp review. But in all reality, they win because the competition just isn't very good. Here they have the best smears/spreads and an excellent variety of bagels to choose from. Their staff are generally always friendly and they are generally pretty quick in terms of getting your food to you. My main gripe with them is the price for sandwiches which taste sub-par at best, so I just stick with the toasted bagels with smear.If I'm in Vegas on a Thursday night, I'm definitely hitting up this spot. Drinks are reasonably priced. Spanish music + live performance are on point. It's in a strip mall, a little out of the way from all the activity on the Vegas Strip, but never a dull time. (Cover was $5-10. Thanks to a few girls who were stumbling by drunk at the time, the bouncer was a little, uh, distracted.)When I am craving really awesome fish and chips, this is the place to go. Especially on fridays, where their fish and chips is all you can eat! Although, be warned that the fish and chips servings are huge so come super hungry lol. And Fridays, they have some live music adding to the awesome vibe of the place. It's an awesome cool place to have a drink and get my fish and chippies on :)I had a ball on my first visit to Geisha! My friend reserved a private karaoke room complete with a stripper pole! As soon as the drinks and food started flowing everyone  was up singing and dancing all around the rooms. Great service, food and drinks!

Most recently I made a visit to on a Saturday night with my girls and we had a great time, the DJ was playing good music and it was very lively which made for great atmosphere for a "girls night out". We started with a round of drinks of course, I ordered the Harajuku Lover which was made with pear vodka and sparkling sake, it was the perfect drink to get the night started. We also ordered an array of appetizers my favs were the edamame and the seasoned fried calamari rings. We got our drinks and appetizers pretty quick but we all ordered specialty maki rolls for our dinner and some of us had to wait up to 45 min. after the first person at the table got their food. I get that that everything is made to order but if we put our orders in at the same time  45 min. is a long time to wait. At one point everyone had their rolls except for me and I had to ask the server was my order put in. If we hadn't been drinking and talking and enjoying ourselves I would have definitely complained.I'm still giving them 4 stars because out of all the times that I come to Geisha this was the only night that there was a slight glitch in the service. I'll be back soon most likely for their awesome happy hour!Just weighing in for the rating, the 4 and 5 star reviews that precede mine sum everything up nicely. I'll just pile on and say that the seafood counter is ridic. Super fresh, no fish smell, competitive prices and a great selection.I really enjoyed the raspberry chocolate macaron. I'm so happy that there is a place in the area that makes this wonderful pastry in the valley and does it well. We also purchased the red velvet and chocolate cupcakes. Those were pretty good. I will return to have lunch and another macaron.Great theatre. Huge, clean $5 matinees. Good concession variety. I went to the Bring your Baby to the movies program 1st Tuesday of each month at noon at Westgate AMC sponsored by the Bump and was surprised to be the only mom there. 

There were 2 other couples but no moms or kids.  Usher came in and gave me baby food as part of their giveaways but no low noise level or dimmed lights or changing area like babycenter.com and bump.com had mentioned there would be. 

Either way it was great to feel welcome with a stroller although I'm not sure if the other couples knew they were in a theatre for moms and kids. 

Hope they advertise this program more. I'm sure lots of stay at home moms would attend.I've walked by this place many a time and I'm pretty sure the "venue" has changed a bit b/c every time we tried it out before it was a SUPER SEEDY R&B and Hip Hop "club".  This time it was more main stream music (Top 40s kinda stuff). 
We happened to walk by on a Thursday night (about two hours after arriving) cuz it was past 1am and Carnival Court (our go to outside bar for Thursday night arrivals) was closing at 2.  It ended up being a lot of fun. 
It's small, the floor is sticky and some of the guys are questionable...but overall the people were fun, the dancing was good and they were open till 4 or 5am, so we got ours. 
Only bad thingS?  No bathroom inside, so you're forced to walk into the nearest hotel to piddle.  The mixed drinks were $7 at 130am, but nearer 330am someone tried charging everyone $10.  We quickly pointed out that we'd been paying $7 (of course she thought we were too drunk to care) and she quickly corrected herself.  
That's all!A few weeks ago I wrote a review on Al's Beef and thought I would do the same taste test with Luke's. 

We ordered the Italian Beef Combo and the double Red Hots just as we did at Al's.  The beef was tasty and the sausage was great, no surprises just as one would expect. What it wasn't -- cut too thin & a wet mush which is what we had at Al's.  Again, sorry! 

The Red Hots filled the poppy seed bun and seemed twice as large. The Vienna Beef dogs snapped as you expect and had a really good taste  Yes, they were boiled too, but clearly someone was watching the stove so they wouldn't over cook. 

Now, in Al's favor their restaurant feels more Chicago-ish, say like a smaller version of Portillos. Luke's is definitely more southside with a lot of Chicago pictures, including 'Bad Rex" Grossman formerly of the "da Bears".

The final tally came to just under $14, which seemed more than fair given the quality of the food and the portions.  Enjoy!Big Buddha, great Chinese food! Reasonable prices and normal Americanized staples. I like how efficient they are for take out orders and the way they package their takeout items rocks (sealed almost tupperware containers!) Fast, and very reasonable prices. Mongolian Beef, Singapore style rice etc. So good. Very well done and tasty. I normally take out for dinner here, and sometimes stop by for a lunch special which is a real bargain. YUM.My Stars are based on Two Things Only!

The Quiche Pie and the Chocolate Chip Cookies! Especially when you go early and they are coming out of the oven! MMMMMM!

Breakfast of Champions!

http://www.paradisebakery.com/It's free, and happens every hour at night at the Mirage. It's pretty cool to stop and look at the first time you see it, every time after that you kind of just walk by it and if it happens to be going on you might smile, but continue walking (unlike Bellagio Fountains show which will usually make you stop 9/10 to finish the song..unless it's Celine Dion ..ughh). Anyway, it's definitely fun to watch and it doesn't make you wish you could get those minutes of your life back (like Sirens of TI does). 

~GSo cool! I had a lot of fun, and its free!! We actually stayed at the Mirage, but it never woke me. I think my sister woke up with it, but it didn't seem to bother her too much. It is very short, so I thought that was nice too. Just a little something to spice up your evening! Just some advice, if you are staying at the hotel, make sure you go and see this from the street or valet pick up. It really makes a HUGE difference and is just so much cooler than seeing it from the room!Great staff, very helpful in wine suggestions. nice place to people watch in the palazzo shopping area.... I personally love to do a wine flight right next to DVF :)
Had a FANTASTIC kenneth wright Pinot Noir due to a staff recommendation- soooo good! Wine shop next door to buy selections... good cheese platter as well.

Definitely would come back here... different vegas type of vibe.Excellent food and service - their 9  oz Wagyu (American Kobe style)  rib eye steak is almost too big to finish since it's so marbled with fat., like eating a standard 16 oz steak. Their other main dishes are also excellent including Dover Sole, Maine lobster, etc.  I love their coffee/doughnut dessert, along with their Banana Creme pie - second only to Emeril's (sorry!), and their warm chocolate souffle.Nothing bad I can say about this store, except I wish it was bigger lol! The girls love coming here for their prizes for doing great in school or just cuz mama feels like spoiling them. The prices aren't bad compared to the toys r us express around the way, and my girls love how girly everything is! Sales people are great with the kids and they're ok with my girls looking and giggling with glee.

Love the stamp program but not sure if they honor it here when I asked them I don't think they understood my question so I just let it go, ;)ok so visiting Phoenix for the weekend and was about to go to another BBQ joint and decided to check it out on Yelp. Found nothing but bad reviews and one of those directed you to Stacy's. We went and it didn't disappoint. The only downfall is that they had run out of pork ribs (we went about 5 ish). So we sampled most everything else. Beef back ribs, falling off the bone. Honestly I've never liked beef ribs but these were so tender I felt like I was eating pork spare ribs. Serving sizes for meat were HUGE. Also ordered pork rib tips, pulled pork sandwich, hot links, and chicken. My family of 10 was very happy. Sides were also very good, mac & cheese, mashed potatoes dripping in butter with awesome homemade gravy, red beans and rice- spicy, potato salad(my mom said was the bomb and she usually only eats her own).  I also tried corn on the cob but didn't like how it turned out. Not sure if they forgot about it, but it was seriously overcooked. However, since the rest of the food was awesome I didn't ding them for it. So if you live in Phoenix area, or just passing through this tiny bbq joint is worth your while.I'm on board with this place.  An island themed fast casual place that has great chicken rice bowls.  I haven't tried anything else, but I always dig places that can do a good brown rice bowl with fresh veggies and good chicken with a good sauce.  Rumbi does it.  The burger looks mysterious to me, but there are so many places out there that do a good burger, I don't anticipate trying theirs.The Pho here is top notch and the spring rolls are out of this world! I am relatively new to vietnamese cuisine but have been to a few other places in the valley. This however is my favorite. Taste the pho and you'll know why they kicked our ass back in the war, the food was better than what the GIs had.We love this place. They quality is so good we never waste time baking deserts for company anymore. The variety they offer is outstanding. Our guests are always impressed. We have never gotten anything we didn't like. Why are we just finding out how awesome good  cupcakes can be? It seems like the cupcake has been around for  a long time but no one took it to the next level until 3 years ago. Regardless, I am glad they did and Retro does it just as good as anybody.This is one of the few places that I've found in the UNLV area that has decent vegan options.  They have 4 tacos that can be made vegan (ask for the tofu ones w/ out the crema sauces), and these toppings can also be put into a burrito.  They have several vegan side items (black beans, plantain chips-YUM, sweet potato fries, and even a quinoa salad).  If you're a UNLV student/staff member, the 4 tacos, 2 sides + drink for $5 is an awesome deal.  For the omnivores, the nachos look like a super deal -- a giant pile of chips and goodies for like $4.50.  Beware on the vegan tacos -- these can be SUPER greasy sometimes. Still tasty, but a little gross.  
They also have a huge selection of microbrews and high gravity beers in addition to a large selection of tequilas.Had lunch there this Sunday, and we liked the experience. I wasn't impressed by the d√©cor, but didn't bother me either: as long as it's clean, I'm fine with it. I care more about the food and the service :)
The field greens salad was simple and nice and the bf loved the lobster bisque. We shared the vodka pasta, and even though it looked small, it was just enough food for the two of us.The absolute best sandwich you will find in Las Vegas drunk at 2 in the morning.  The fresh baked bread overflows with every cold cut and topping you could possibly imagine.  I have no idea what I paid for that foot-long, but it was WELL worth every penny.

The staff was overly friendly to two guys who obviously were in dire straits and in NEED of sustenance.I like going in the early afternoon during the week. I avoid the weekends and the weekdays after 4pm like the plague. Crowds drain me. I avoid them when shopping. 

I like the bulk prices, clean store, friendly staff. However, I'm not the exploratory type, though that is one of the personalities Costco markets. That's why there are no aisle signs. They want you to explore, discover, and search for what you need - in hopes you stay longer and end up buying more of what you see, even though you don't need it. It works, even on me. I admit.

All in all I go because I have a consuming family. So buying in bulk saves me money and time because - in theory - we won't run out of things as quickly.I really really enjoyed this place. We went with a group and had no idea what we were getting ourselves into. with around 8 people we basically just gave the waiter a set price and told him to pick stuff himself and let us try as much of a variety as we could. The lowest he could go was $40 a person which sounded fair to us. 

For the next hour and a half he brought out around 10 plates all with delicious things for us to taste. I was worried that no one would leave full but we all filled up pretty quickly and everything was beautifully made and tasted great!

It's pricey but I think it's worth it. Next time I go, I will be prepared to drop more cash to get more food.

I will never forget the sea bass. Ever. 

The waiter was great by the way. I don't remember his name but he's great with people, knows the food inside and out, and really made it a great experience for us. He's blond with curly hair, not too tall, and lean, not a big dude. try to get him if you can.I wish we could have ordered more food.  Their menu was extensive! 

We were only able to try their ceviche, one sushi roll, seared kobe and these taquitos.  They were all really good! Skip out on the lobster taquito though. That was everyone's least favorite.

Other than that, had a lovely time here.  Food was great.  Def. coming back to eat again.  This time, I want to try the sea bass, which I was eyeing last time I was here.We were staying in the Palazzo and really wanted sushi so we came here.

Definitely get the family style recommendation option. 

Basically, you tell your server what you like (like yellow tail, tuna, avocado, pork, miso, etc.) and a budget, and they bring out family style dishes within your budget that they think are matched with your favorite ingredients.

This was amazing - we wouldn't have ordered many of the things they gave us.

Definitely ask for some sushi, and definitely ask for miso-braised sea bass - this was the best item we had!!!!!

Otherwise, just let the kitchen do the work for you. The surprise element is great too. If you don't like a dish, the kitchen takes it back with full responsibility too, which is great.

There's two areas to sit in, the front area near the entrance and the "sugar cane" room in the back. We got sat in the latter, and it was much cooler than the front. Quieter, a little darker, and more "exclusive" seeming than the front.the only reason i give them 4 stars instead of 5 is the price.  a tad pricey but the food is always prepared colorfully and tastefully.  they often have a combo deal which is good to share.  their portions are very large and this is enough for 2.
the atmosphere is pleasant, usually chilly so bring a sweater.  a couple of the older men that are waiters are a bit grumpy but at least you don't have to deal with them often.  i would recommend it.Touristy place to take out of town friends.  It's sort-of old west.  They have live entertainment, fire pits, and chairs made of odd stuff.  Cool place for families with kids, but be aware:  Depending on what time you show up there will be some adults out to drink, and party.

Food is better than your average bar food but the prices are a little steep.

We went during a slow time of day.  The service was terribly slow and unorganized.  Even with no one there things seemed hectic.  Our waitress payed no attention to us at all.

On the other hand...the bar staff was fast, friendly and more than competent.  I sort of felt sorry for the bartender.  We had to keep asking her for things that our waitress was neglecting (napkins, silverware, water, where is our appetizer? etc.).  The bartender ended up doing her own job at the bar (and she was much busier than the people in the dinning room) as well as our servers job.  I bet she hated that (but she didn't show it)  We gave her a big big big tip.I finally made it to this Chompie's location... and just like the rest of the Chompie's I've been to, it goes to the category "Best Deli in AZ" - still not New York, and I think I may even prefer Goldberg's in Atlanta, but in Phoenix, Chompie's is the place!

We were there for dinner and I did order one thing that I never ordered from Chompie's before... Sweet Potato Fries!  Yes, Chompie's has pretty good sweet potato fries - yay!  I filled up on pickles and I also had a salad and a scoop of their whitefish salad.  (I probably would not order that again).  

Stick with knishes, bagels, sandwiches, and even omelettes - you'll be pleased.  Oh - and I cannot forget their soups... especially matzah ball and kreplach - yummy!  And if you have a sweet tooth, there is PLENTY to choose from!

Now I'm craving Chompie's again... I have to figure out which location is closest to my new digs!Okay, judging a Vietnamese restaurant on the decor is a little jaded IMHO.  Ambience is certainly a factor when dining, and if that's your most pressing criteria you're probably not fit to go into most Vietnamese places.
Pholicious does a great job with their food-went their for lunch over the weekend and tried their oxtail pho which was very good.  My buddy had chicken & vegetable chow fun which was also delicious.  Sizable portions and the most unique serving of Thai iced coffee I think I've ever had.  Almost like a half old time Italian espresso pot on top of a coffee cup that holds the coffee and condensed milk.  You're supposed to stir this then add the contents to the accompanying glass of ice.  Unlike dummy me who just dumped it in the ice :)Excellent service, good music and great food.I heard great things about JJ's sandwiches. So I took a gamble and phoned in a Italian night club sandwich with hit cherry peppers with no mayo. The sandwich did not disappoint. It was tasty, the Italian sauce was tasty. I like the French bread, it was firm but soft inside. Price was 5.75 for a good size sandwich.I ate here for a work dinner in and it was alright.  We had chips and salsa, asada, strawberry drink, tamales, and it was all decent.  The carmel flan looked nasty and none of us would eat it ;))  Service was  a bit slow in the server bringing us drinks and water.  It is in odd location towards back.i've heard so much hype about this place and after reading some reviews about wearing heels, make up and accessories--i was a bit worried. it actually didnt matter as much, if you're not trying to impress anyone. if you had a hot bikini, you're fine. you'll be in the water, so accessories and heels wouldnt matter much. it may if you have to stand in the general admission line.

guestlist line went by pretty fast--there were 3 parts to get through: guestlist into the general pool area where you stood in line again to be let into another line for them to search your stuff. since they're so thorough, it takes forever and a half. my tiny clutch of a purse took a good minute or two. also, no bottles of any sorts, even unopened bottles of water. they do have water fountains inside.

once inside, we grabbed some towels off of this obscure pile of towels. there were no distinctive signs for pool boy like encore beach club. we settled by the 6" pool area and tanned. the food was decently priced--a bucket of chicken with waffle fries for about $13. they were enough to feed three girls, with left overs.

the place got pretty crowded around 2pm and the water got a bit murkier as well. beer bottles and straws were floating in the water. random conga lines forming in the pool and people stomping water. love the green chairs for you to lay on to tan.

it was a nice place to be but after the previous night, i couldnt drink too much. lots of fit and beautiful people. great place to people watch and to dance. the DJ was a bit on and off with the music, but when he was on, the pool was moving.We had a group of 14 that went to Wet Republic on a Thursday. They had a DJ/music but no one with a big name. We rented a private bungalow ($1,000 min that goes toward food and beverage - you get your own TV, ) and it was worth every penny, but the bungalows are a LOT more expensive on the weekends. Bottle prices, beer bucket prices, etc. were on par with Vegas clubs (bottles starting in the $400s and buckets of Corona for $80, plus with the bungalow you have to pay about 28% in tax and tip on top of those prices).

There wasn't a big crowd that day by any means, but we still had an awesome time. 

The one thing I want to point out - bring the absolute minimum in regards to personal belongings. With the bungalow, having a little bag with my camera and phone, ID and money in it was no big deal - but I'm glad that's *all* that I had, because they cleaned my friends out. One of them had singularly sealed, OTC headache meds (in a brand new box that had never been opened!) - confiscated. Another had sealed band aids confiscated. I understand that they have a very strict policy regarding illegal substances, but it's not posted until you get right to the entrance. So if you'd been waiting in line, or if you weren't staying at the Grand...you're out of luck, and bye-bye to that Ibuprofen you need for that hangover headache or whatever. Again, I understand if this is the rule, but it would have been nice to know it ahead of time, especially as I've been to other (albeit smaller) pool parties in Vegas, and plenty of clubs, without ever having anything like that confiscated.Hidden gem in Silverton Casino. Seafood and steaks, at a reasonable price point. We had crab cakes, lobster bisque, risotto with seared scallops, NY steak. Bread basket was a bomb! We'll return.Even though this location is not the best I still love Target. If you really want a good target experience drive a little more south and hit up the Tempe Marketplace location or go a little more north and go to the Raintree location.For the most part a standard Target.  The Pharmacy Staff is great.  The staff has been generally nice and helpful.We have been to Brutta a half dozen times and the food is consistently great. Finoccio pizza is a favorite, and the large salads are big enough to share w/3-4 people.

Derek (owner?) has been uber-accommodating to my partner, who has a wheat allergy. She brings in her own crusts, and they load it up with any toppings she'd like.

Friendly, kind service + terrific pizza & salads + good wine or beer. Perfect for a relaxed night out with friends or sweethearts. A consistent favorite.A charming, small restaurant in a central location.
I had wanted to try this place forever and I'm so glad I finally did!
Absolutely wonderful food and top-notch service.
Go when it's not busy so that you get a good seat.
You absolutely MUST try to CenPho Press Panini. Apple slices, bacon, and creamy brie complement eachother SO nicely!This place starts out as sort of an old fashioned general store/gift shop, & you wend your way through to a doorway leading to a fairly large restaurant with wooden chairs & all sorts of "old junk"...  pictures, guitars, skillets & so on hanging on the walls.  It's different & interesting, although the more conventional booth seating at a comparable place such as Black Bear is more comfortable.

Things were fairly busy here on this Tuesday at about 11:30 AM, but I landed a reasonably comfortable little cove with a table & chairs to enjoy my lunch.

Lots of things on the menu looked good, & I settled in on a 1/2 lb. Bacon Cheeseburger for this first visit.  It came with a little cup of Cole Slaw & a brim full cup of piping hot Vegetable Beef Soup.  Now, let's get to the extremes.

My burger was cooked just right, & it was SPECTACULAR!  It was my new favorite burger ever, ever...  even surpassing such greats as Five Guys, Smashburger, & Bobby-Q.  The Cole Slaw & soup were terrific, too!  The prices are very reasonable as well.  All this was only $8.49, & there were other lunches on the menu for even a couple dollars less!  (Then why only 4-Stars, you ask?)

The service was pretty awful!  Although my server was nice enough, I had to ask her twice for some extra napkins, twice for a glass of water, once for some ketchup (that I shouldn't have had to ask for with this order), & she brought me a drink I didn't order.  Then at the end, there was the drink I didn't order on my check, so I had to look for her for a while to have her fix that.  Also, she never refilled my water until I was about to get up to leave!  This is 1-Star service, people!

Friend Matt S. was so right about this place in his review!  I just can't get myself to give it fewer than 4-Stars because the food was so special.  I'll try the one in Ahwatukee next time & see how it goes over there.     :-))Huge lot of shoes to pick from and great prices.  I've bought a few pairs of shoes here and will probably buy a few more as long as I live in the area.I'm not a big fan of LVAC, as I think that they are rude and uncaring to their customers.  

That being said, I signed up for a gym membership with them because I was desperate to lose weight after having surgery 2 years ago.

I tend to go to this location around 5:30/6:00am.  Parking is never an issue, although I'm not one of those people who stalk others for a spot right by the door.  You're at the GYM.  You're going to EXERCISE. 
Walk an extra 50 feet.  It won't kill you, I promise.

I usually go to the women's only gym, simply because at that time of the morning, its not packed, and I feel more comfortable without people leering at me.  

Bathrooms and locker rooms are spotless.  

I work an unusual schedule, so I don't get to go to classes as often as I'd like, however, Marissa H's yoga classes (the Friday morning at 6 is AWESOME) are my favorite.  I've studied yoga off and on for years, but again, was inactive for about 2 years after my surgery.  Marissa is attentive, and provides alternatives and modifications for those of us who aren't quite up to some of the harder poses.  She is always available to give tips and pointers, and is a great person.  Love her.

I've also taken the CXWorks class, which is a 30 minute ab class.  I died.  It was amazing.

I'm giving this location 4 stars, because the employees HERE and the facility are good.   I am not a fan of their Corporate workers, as they are extremely insensitive and rude.  But this facility, I would recommend.  
I pay $22 a month and can work out whenever I want, holidays included.This place has reasonable "asian fusion" food. I ate lunch here almost 5 days in a row while at the Palazzo for work. I tried all of their noodles each time. The ingredients they use are VERY fresh. The service is very friendly. The ambiance is whimsical. 

A bowl of noodles, drink will run you about $20 (tax and tips included).
That is not too bad for being in Vegas.They had me at Happy Hour all day, every day (closed Sunday).  The Bar offers continuous happy hour with half price cocktails, beers, wine, and appetizers.  Everything I've had is excellent including Mo' Rockin Shrimp, Mint Pesto Grilled Lamb Chops and Toasted Horseradish-Mashed Potato Stuffed Shrimp.  The quality of bar service depends on how busy they are -- expect busy and slow -- the food and drinks are worth savoring so not a problem unless you are in a hurry.I had the pleasure of spending Valentines Day dinner at Eddie's House. I really don't understand some of these bad reviews.. Overall I had a nice experience.

We had an 8:45 reservation and were sat probably around 9. I didn't mind the wait because we got to belly up to the bar, have a glass of champagne and visit the nice bartender. 

Once sat we were immediately served a bread basket accompanied by a pesto spread and bleu cheese butter. The pesto was very tasty. 

My date and I split a bottle of Sauvignon Blanc and an order of the ahi tartar "nachos" appetizer. The tartar was very good and had a few surprising bites with a nice kick of spice. 

For entrees I had scallops, (obviously) that came served with cauliflower. They were seared perfectly and I very much enjoyed them. My date had a prosciutto wrapped filet. I think. I was too wrapped up in my own dinner to pay much attention. Whoops ;) 

Honestly the only part of the meal I didn't enjoy was the service. Our waiter was friendly enough but seemed extremely awkward. It was also pretty obvious he was trying to upsell us, which I understand is part of a servers job, but I don't like when it's so blatant. He also made me feel bad about my choice of wine by telling me the last two people who ordered it sent it back. I don't feel like that is something you should share with your customers? 

Oh well. The awkwardness and pushy salesmanship will not be enough to deter me from returning. Apparently they do all night happy hour in the bar during the week. Sign me up!Great neighborhood chinese. Affordable, delicious, and great customer service. Volcano Shrimp will change your life!WOW.  I (along with 3 toddlers) went to this spot last night. I will start off by saying AMAZING. yummy authentic deliciousness. So good, that the husband decided that we will go again tonight for dinner lol.  The only reason why I didn't give five stars because I ordered a shrimp taco without cheese and it came out with cheese. Nonetheless.. I ate it. And, is was pretty darn fantastic. Yummy Yummy and the prices are beyond affordable.  The server was SOO friendly, food was hot and, The tacos were so good that we ordered more later lol. 

Try the Ceviche. 
Marlin Tacos
Fish Tacos
Shrimp Tacos
Guacamole
Decent Margaritas

I did get two refils of the salsa and chips. And, next time I would love to try the Oysters.An example on how crazy Steve Wynn is: money was spent on special windows on the casino floor so that you can see the pool outside at night without the lights in the casino reflecting on the glass. We went there during the day and it looked like there wasn't glass there at all. I dunno if it was the special windows or the janitors doing an excellent job.

You'll pass Encore's shopping area if walking from the Wynn. You'll pass the usual high end shops plus XS nightclub. The first thing you'll notice is that the casino is much more brighter than the Wynn with the white drapes and the natural sunlight coming in. 

I was very suprised the table minimum for roulette here was $10; I was expecting $15 so I decided to play a little bit and ordered a cranberry/vodka. It was the best casino cocktail ever.They had to have used Goose because it was so smooth. 

It was so good, Clarisse C. and I convinced our friends to chill at the penny slots and get some drinks. Don't go to the bar with the video poker because you won't get comped drinks there. Be patient and try not to lose all your money at the slots trying to get free drinks haha

I will stay here one day.I enjoyed my stay at Encore. The rooms were Beautiful! The staff there were very helpful. There were windows in the casino which was nice, you never see that in Vegas. The self parking was nice, very easy to get into, and the parking elevators werent far from the room elevators. 

If you going to Vegas on somewhat of a budget, not the place for you. Can't play a poker machine at the bar and get a free drink, and if you decided to pay for a drink it was close to $16. My other complaint, was my room never got cold enough.Now this is what you call living the High Life in Las Vegas! I absolutely love their modern fixtures and the service overall is stupendous. Unlike other Vegas hotels that leaves you skin dry and flaky with the smell of cigarettes, the Encore's air was not dry and was well ventilated with no smoking floors available. Their standard King Suites are spacious with dual sinks, a huge soaking tub and a separate walk in shower. Oh and did I mention that all the lights and curtains can be operated by the touch of a button next to your bed (especially useful for those long nights and sleep-in mornings--that's what you get for waking up in Vegas!)

The amenities are great too! The pool area is great to lounge in and get and take a dip on a hot and humid day. Their are also plenty of shops and restaurants to choose from that are all top notch! I'd definitely recommend staying at the Encore.

The only reason I knocked it one star was because the View from my room was looking at the opposite end of the strip with a glimpse of the Stratosphere, Circus Circus, a church and a construction lot. If you can, request a strip view as I hear the views on that end are spectacular. Depending on the time of visit, you can also upgrade your room to a panoramic high floor room for just $20 bucks more a night. Something I'll definitely consider the next time I visit!Went to see a movie this Sunday morning at Harkins in Tempe Marketplace (no, not Real Steel, Ides of March people, give me credit for a little class) and is my wont I went with my fellow movie-goer over to this fine Irish establishment. The nice thing about Sunday lunch, it is not that crowded and the service is generally quite quick.

The server, a lovely young woman whose name I can't recall, in a fetching Scottish/Irish lass sort of outfit that is somewhat less risque than what one might find at the tilted kilt, was kind enough to let us know they had Pumpkin Porter from Four Peaks on tap so kudos to what is a chain restaurant for bringing some local brews into the mix and actively letting the customers know about the option.

However, I've had it several times so I chose a light wheat bear, the 20 oz size and I had the roasted beet and flat iron steak option. I generally get a burger but decided to try something new and wow, what a great meal option! It was a mixed green salad  with various additions to the side and not on the salad which was nice. It included a small but delicious portion of grilled flank steak, which was done to medium rare as asked, a portion of both golden and dark purple roasted beets and, to my delight, a small mix of blue veined cheese and walnuts. It went amazingly well with my wheat beer so glad I did not choose the pumpkin porter.

So yes, a chain restaurant, but that provides focus on operations, in this case, that enhances rather than making the dining experience overly bland. I don't think I would go out of my way to go here since I've got three Irish pubs in walking distance of my house (Casey Moore's, Robbie Foxes and Rula Bula) but for a place to go before or after a cinematic experience at Harkins, thumbs up to D'Arcy McGee's! :-)We were served by Cheyenna.  She was pleasant and upbeat, which seems to be the norm for servers at Red Robin.  The food is always good, and one of the few places where I don't have to force my son to eat the food that I give him (he's 2).  Always a fun atmosphere.  Recommend to anyone who is looking for a cheap lunch or dinner that is quick, but doesn't feel like you're being rushed.  Enjoy!!!Can't remember the last time I was here, but if you like vegan food, this place is pretty good!

I tried this place a few years ago, prior to their expansion, and I remember it being a pretty good place.  The only reason why I haven't gone back is because its a good 25-30 minute drive from my house.  It's located on the corner of Sahara and Buffalo.  This little trendy lookin' place is good for lunch or dinner, or maybe just some desert or a coffee.  They serve sandwiches, paninis, wraps, pizzas, salads, pasta, and rice plates all of which can be served up vegan.  They have specials for November, but I ended up ordering the Chicken Provolone, which had chicken, spinach, roasted tomato, basil, provolone and pesto dressing grilled between two slices of whole wheat bread.  It came with a choice of chips or salad all for about $8; pretty cheap, considering the size of the plate and the freshness of the veggies.  To me, it tasted slightly bland, but not enough for me to complain.  I heard from another patron, that the specials were pretty good, so I'll probably give that a whirl next time around.

The service was so-so.  Granted, it was really busy--peak lunch hours (1:00pm).  My server tried to be attentive, but with the influx of customers that trolled in, I felt like she was flustered.  I was surprised I found a table.  If you're coming in here around this time, get here early and just anticipate to wait a little just so you can forewarn your belly.

So... the main thing that brought me to give this place 4 stars (and almost pushed me to 5... almost) were their vegan desserts.  OMG, their vegan desserts.  It's like heaven in your mouth.  Their dessert case displayed a wide variety of cakes; each one, based on what the lady behind the counter had told me, were under 200 calories (say what?! lol). I asked her a little bit about her preference and what was popular, etc, etc, to try to narrow down my options (seriously, there's so many cakes I had no idea which to choose from).  Apparently, the vanilla chocolate chip cake and red velvet are among the popular ones.  I ended up choosing the lemon cake along side my espresso.  It was delicious; moist and dense, with a light and sweet topping that had lemon rind bits mixed into it.  I also brought home their vegan chocolate chip cookies: tasty, not sweet, soft, chewy, slightly crisp around the edges, not too many chocolate chips---perfect.

Definitely would go here again.  Wish it weren't too far.  Wish it weren't too crowded.  I wanna try their breakfast for sure!Finally, REAL food for veggie-sauruses!

Listen, I'm a converted die-hard carnivore, and a dedicated foodie.  I'm a decent sized dude @ 6ft tall, 205lbs., I like FOOD.  I rarely eat out since going vegan due to the utter lack of anything beyond rabbit food as a choice at other restaurants.  I tried the whole "macro-bio-raw-super expensive-sh++ on a plate" thing at the other restaurant up the street.  Thank GOD I stumbled upon RVC!

Everything on their menu can be made vegan.  I had the California Panini.  I was deeply impressed.  It was downright tasty, it was hearty and filling.  (I hope they didn't use real mayo...)  The side salad, although just greens, was fabulous, with a perfect vinagrette (perfect amount too, not drowning the leaves like every other restaurant in the world)  I could actually TASTE that the lettuce was organic.  

I don't know what others on Yelp are complaining about, our service was excellent.  The kid was very attentive, friendly, knowledgable and helpful.

The prices were very reasonable, on par or better with other joints selling non organic, non vegan fare.

I give it only 4 stars because they were playing club music way too loud in the initial room we first walked into.  We went into the other room, where there was no music playing, and sat in the back table and still had trouble carrying on a conversation.  BOOM! CHICKA-BOOM, CHICKA-BOOM, CHICKA-BOOM, CHICKA-BOOM, CHICKA-BOOM, CHICKA-BOOM... @80BPM, During lunch.  Come on, guys...

Other than that.  A fantastic place.  I'll be back, and if that music is still like that, I'll definitely yell at someone about it.  This place is too much of a gem to have the college age kids who work there ruin it with lousy music.I came to know this place because my boy suggested we stop by here for lunch the other day. My first impression? It was simple, clean, and humble. I got the club sandwich "Mikes Way" and to be honest I was very surprised at the amount of flavor it kicked. So here is a break down of my experience.

Pros:
1. The place was clean and homey.
2. The employees were courteous and polite.
3. The food was actually really good and didn't have the gritty industrialized taste like Subway sandwiches have. Very fresh and everything is prepared in front of you, even the meat is sliced to order.

Cons:
1. They overdid the sauce. 

If you are not aware what "Mikes Way" is, it is the option of getting olive oil, vinaigrette, onion, tomato, lettuce, and different herbs and spices in your sandwich. It is delicious, so don't get me wrong when I complain about this. However they over oiled my sandwich causing it to go very soggy, very fast. By the time I finished a half of my sandwich and moved to the other, it was falling apart like no ones business. It became a hassle to eat the other half. This is the only negative thing I could find about this place hence 4 stars instead of 5 stars. Over all the experience was fantastic but make sure if you ask for "Mikes Way" to ask them to go easy on the sauce.Everything about this theatre is crisp and clean & very well presented.  They was not 1 thing out of place: from the ticket sales area, to the front entrance & lobby, and the bar area.  (Should have more seating for waiting before the show and to have drinks at.)

Inside the theatre, the seating at the tables was set-up to a "T".  Nothing was out of place, and all the tables were perfecting set.  Our sever was extremely attentive and was great about answering any questions we had in regards to the menu, food, and wine.  The 1 order of chicken tasted pretty weird, but my prime rib was good, as well as the order of short ribs.  Bread basket was nice and hot.  Kids liked the chocolate  fondue with fruit.

It was my mistake for not reading the description of the production we saw to be better informed that is was not the broadway show of Phantom of the Opera, rather it was just "Phantom" we saw.  None of the known broadway songs in the original play from Andrew Llyod Weber were sung.  Although this is based from the same book, I, as well as others around me, we quite disappointed that the smash-hit we were used to and loved was not the same.  The stage sets, costumes, make-up and effects were all good for the venue.  I guess I was just expecting the same play in which I had seen on broadway previously.  It was still an overall good experience.Another reason to stay at the Mirage.  After winning at the craps tables, head to BLT for the trio of Kobe sliders.  Simply the move.  If you can handle a chocolate shake (I could only handle a sip) with that you will be in a food induced coma, which will keep you from giving back your winnings.  Onion rings were just okay as they were cut too thin and could not stand up to the batter.  Overall a great Vegas Strip choice.  Just go for it!We thoroughly enjoyed our gondola ride at the Venetian.  We opted for the outdoor ride.  We lucked out and walked up, bought our tickets, and were able to board within 15 minutes.  It was a beautiful day, warm with a slight breeze.  Our guide was a friendly older gentleman who chatted us up, same some Sinatra for us, and let us enjoy the company of each other.  Couldn't have asked for anything better at that moment.  Oh and we got a cute picture of us on the gondola (too bad it cost $20+ for the photo).  Hey don't forget to tip your guide.Where else can you go for a Candlelight dinner on Valentines Day and NOT spend a fortune?  Yep your local participating Waffle House.  Tonight was my wifes and I third consecutive year going to Waffle House on Valentines Day.  They did a nice job of decorating a section with streamers, tableclothes, Roses and Candles.  There was even a table with Strawberry's and Chocolate.  Aside from being a little ecletic, it's a nice way to enjoy the evening.

Sadly, the dinner was not fullfilling.  Our server forgot our pies, we had to request them, and the staff was enjoying the chocolate covered strawberries set out for the customers.  I can't say I blame them, but when they are blatant about it, thats a little to much.  

I'm glad that they went to the trouble of making things nice while still staying true to their own menu.  We'll be back again next year.The Hero Factory is 2 minutes from my office, good for my foodie obsession, bad for my waisteline.  This place has absolutely one of the biggest heros I've had.  $10 will get you a hero and a drink.  A little pricey but I can never eat the whole thing and that means lunch the next day too.I had a groupon for a 50 minute facial.  The lobby is very nice and the lady at the front is very friendly.  My facial was excellent.  The only complaint I would have is that they don't have private rooms.  It is one big room with cubicles divided by sheets.  I could hear others talking and the door into the area constantly opening and closing.  It throws off the relaxation vibe a bit.Lunch buffet was lacking in presentation and choices but everything I had was very good.  Some of the food items could have been hotter.  The important part is that the food was excellent and the service friendly.Give the food three stars but overall a four because of the outstanding service I always receive. Better to be had on Spring Mountain but this place is good for a fix since they were the only place in Henderson until recently. It will be interesting now that another joint opened up literally across the street.We've eaten there twice, with two different servers, and I'd give four stars each time.  They've got a great bar with very friendly bartenders.  Haven't tried any appetizers, but we've had the Delmonico steak (done just right at medium rare) and the crab claws - delicious.  I think the crab claws are now also available as an appetizer.  Wine list is a little light (the owner told me he was trying to keep the wines at a reasonable price point, and he has, but he could still add some more to the list) and the prices are a bit high, but still about what I expected to pay at a good steak house.  We'll definitely go backWow - I was pleasantly surprised by Brio. When my friend suggested meeting up at SanTan Village, I wasn't too hopeful I'd find a decent place for us to eat. But we both really enjoyed our meals. There was a 45 minute wait for a table, but we quickly snagged a table in the bar area, which wasn't too loud or busy. I had a really delicious malbec and we both had soup as appetizers - lobster bisque and cream of mushroom. They were both delicious, and after eating the soup and the warm bread and flaxseed crisps they give out free, I knew we were probably in for a good meal. When our entrees came, we weren't disappointed. My friend had a scallop and shrimp eggplant spicy risotto (ok, that's not what it was called, but that's what it was) which was great and I had a ricotta-filled ravioli with vodka sauce - it's supposed to come with prosciutto, but they were nice about subbing mushrooms for me instead, since I'm a vegetarian. We didn't have any room for dessert, unfortunately. All in all, this was a really pretty, tasty, and friendly place for dinner. I'd like to return!My husband and I have lived in this community since 2008.  We love the location, the amenities and the price.  Mostly we love that they helped us out when my husband lost his job in 2009.  We had only been here a year and he knew he was going to be let go. We went to the leasing office to see if they had a less expensive apartment or could cut us a break until he got another job.  We still had 6 months left on our lease at this point and couldn't afford to break it.  Fortunately they did have a much cheaper apartment in the C building which was the same size as the one we had been renting in the B building.  All we had to do was transfer the lease and move.  They didn't charge a transfer fee or require an additional deposit.  (And this was with the former management.)  We've been there ever since.  As long as rent only goes up by $25-50 a month were staying cause I hate packing!  

The community has been under a new management company for about a year.  We have not had any problems with the new management company.  The new management updated all the equipment in the gym and updated the floors.  All the staff changed but the new staff are good.  We've never had a problem with our neighbors.  Maintenance issues are taken care of in a reasonable time period. (Unless its an emergency then they're there ASAP. )  

I personally like that there is a little park on Portland where our neighbors take their dogs.  I don't have a dog but it's nice to live in a pet friendly community.  There are also tons of trash cans and doggie bag dispensers so no one has an excuse not to clean up after their dog.  If I didn't actually see the dogs every day, I would have no idea that anyone owned a dog downtown.

We recommend this place to everyone.Overall the food was pretty good.  I went relatively late for dinner, so the lines were pretty low, and my meal was cheap, but that is only because of casino comps. If it weren't for the comps, I probably would have given them 3 stars, because they seemed a little on the pricey side. The service was good, pretty quick and decent for the crowd. The portions were appropriate; I  did not leave hungry. The food was flavorful. I recommend getting a soup, because they are huge, easily big enough to be shared amongst 2-3 people, and they are delicious.Bosco Pizza! Can't review anything else because I can't remember what else we ate!  I've been craving that pizza ever since we had it.  I will definitely be back for the Bosco pizza.  Mushrooms, cheese and truffle oil! Delicious!!!Good lunch. Although the pad Thai isn't very authentic, I like it a lot :)best sesame chicken!! I haven't had any 
curry noodles are delicious, so are the regular noodles (with the red sauce on top!)

prices are a bit pricey so i usually just get the chicken.This was my first time here, but a coworker recommended it.  Great food and cute atmosphere. I had the buffalo fingers with fries which was more than enough to fill me up for lunch. The only downside is that the service was very slow, which could've been due to the fact that there were several large parties in the restaurant. Overall though, nice place. They even have a patio for outside dining.Very good Thai reminds me of my favorite place back home... Chicken satay is awesome... My favorite dish is the Elephant garlic Beef... It's awesome and their soy sauce is not your typical Kimlan (even thought its in a Kimlan jar) and is amazing!!I just had lunch here. all you can eat baby. The salmon skin roll is sooooooooooo gooooooooooooooood!!!! This is one of my favorite sushi places. Small cozy place. !!!Plaka is a good, but basic place to get breakfast, especially if you're on a budget.  I don't have very many words to say about this place, but it does everything pretty well.  The setting is Greek, but more that they have a lot of Greek style things on their walls rather than a real atmosphere that omits "Greek" to you.  I'm perfectly fine with that though, as it hints enough at what to expect of the place.  In addition, they have a patio area open during the warmer seasons, which is great for catching some fresh air while you're dining.

As for the service:  I'm a fan, because it's quick and you're being served by some nice folks.  It's not over the top nice, but they get the job done with a smile, and that's sufficient for me.

The breakfast menu is somewhat basic, but it's executed well.  It has all of the essentials, and some items have a Greek twist (i.e: Gyro Omelets, getting Pita bread instead of toast as a side).  I'm a sucker for breakfast potatoes, and the ones they serve here always satisfy my craving.

The big thing for me about Plaka is that for what you pay, you get a very solid experience.  I've never spent less than $10 total on a meal there, which I can't say about very many other places that are actually good.  It's a great alternative for breakfast if Mickie's Dairy Bar is too far or crowded.

Overall, i'm giving Plaka a 4, because I would definitely recommend it to most people I know.  However, Plaka's not a very unique place, nor does it take very many risks.  Because of that, I wouldn't a call a place you HAVE to go to, but a place that does the basics well.This is the only massage place I will go from now on.  I love the massages by Steve Ibach, he knows what he is doing.  My old body has so many aches and pains and he focuses on whatever is ailing you.  The place is small, however it is very cozy and you feel at home.Wife loved the ribs, BBQ chicken was ok. Service was awesome!  We were served by trainee Dawn being trained by Samantha. They were very fun!This has become my go-to dinner spot for every trip to Vegas when we actually have time for something more substantial than room service chicken strips or Earl's Sandwiches.

If you are always tight on time like we are in Vegas, order it to-go! Make sure you call about 30 minutes before you actually want to pick it up though as it does get busy here at dinner time as it's not a fast food joint. I'd love to sit and dine at this quaint little place in the Venetian if I could ever find time.

Fun little extra? All the workers have pretty thick Italian accents and are extremely friendly! Although it makes ordering via the phone a little difficult at times.

Both times I have gotten the Tortellini Alfredo. Medium chewy pieces of tortellini stuffed with delicious cheese in an extremely buttery cream sauce. The portion for this is a bit deceiving visually when you first get it, it seems small, but it will definitely fill you up! Plus, the free garlic knots that come with it are delicious and are a wonderful vehicle for you to scoop up any remaining sauce you have on your plate. YUMS

For 3 pasta entrees the total was around $55. Which for Vegas, isn't bad at all.Thought I would try this place and was quite impressed! They have a bakery which provides a wide array of Italian pastries and desserts, as well as a great selection of entrees and apps! 

The vibe is very casual home- New York and the staff is super nice! The bread so good and came with a small loaf of chewy home made bead and garlic/cheese twists. So good! I ordered the rice balls for an app. Four balls covered in cheese with marinara came. They were moist, tender and the cheese/sauce ratio complimented them well! Chicken parmigiana was my entree. I ordered it with fettuccine and ate half of it since it was such a big plate! The chicken was breaded and cooked perfectly. The sauce was thin, but was flavorful. Dessert was the chocolate cannoli which was amazing! The ricotta filling wasn't too sweet and I loved the texture of the pastry! Our server even brought out a small plate of cookies which was such a sweet end to a delicious meal! I will be returning often! :)whether you go to Jeff for lessons, his shows, or the Wonderground, you are in for a treat.  This man is a fine teacher no matter your age or skill level.  
If you seek instruction in a group or solo setting, look into McBride's classes.
There are even lessons to be had online these days.  His skills are top notch.Cute little place to go to. Very friendly staff and great environment. I haven't gone on nights with the music, but just stopping by for lunch is nice. They have comfy chairs (all diff. kinds) and its a nice atmosphere. (outside seating avail).The food is good, simple (which I like) but tasty. Only drawback is the limited amt. of parking.Ruby Tuesdays is stuck in a tragic location in my opinion. It's right next to Red Robin which is my all time favorite American chain. So naturally I never go there since I'd much rather have Red Robin. I'm glad my parents convinced me to come with them though.

Everybody was satisfied with their meal and their salad bar looked very fresh. My grandfather took part in it and each time he came back I was surprised at the abundance of things he managed to find there. 

My meal was smoked salmon with broccoli and there weren't any complains there. The server was polite and attentive. Honestly I don't have any complaints. The prices were a little higher than I'd expected but well worth it. The atmosphere was nice and quiet and relaxed. I can always appreciate that. 

Great place for a classy simple American meal.Awesome ambiance throughout!  Love the bar area and the pool.  Great sushi place there.  Great location!  One of the coolest W hotels in US.District, it's the restaurant & bar in the newly opened Sheraton in downtown.  What can you say about being at a place on opening really.  It's shiny, the leather is fresh, the decor is new, and so are the staff.  Being the first official day open, there was staff everywhere, but that was taken advantage of quickly.  They all were eager to talk, only thing is most of them have not sampled the full line-up of wares.  I looked for suggestions before ordering, but could not receive any.  By no means did this stop me from trying items though.  The main theme of food and beverages is local, or least from the United States (or territories).  The first thing noticed was the beer on tap, all microbrews, and half of them from Arizona breweries.  The wine list was decent, but 95% of them hailing from California.  Liquor selections were the same, all U.S. made, meaning no tequila.  They were still waiting for half of their bottles to arrive, as the shelves did not match the menu yet.  I suppose items like Tito's Vodka from Texas is not the easiest item to have on hand upon opening.  Although I was promised it would arrive soon.  The menu was not extensive and nothing screamed try me, but a few descriptors did engage my eyes, such as 'angry onions'.  Still, nothing outrageous or unheard of.  Being with a baseball-minded friend, we did sit at the bar (the restaurant being empty) just to have something to watch and decided to sample from several apps.  Local Jerky, as listed, was locally produced jerky ranging from Elk to Buffalo to Turkey.  It came out served on a wooden plank in a small canning jar.  Accompanying it were stone ground mustard, sea salt, and pickled garlic, all in small white angled bowls.  Next item was chips and dips, house-made potato chips in a large bowl on a wooden plank as well.  They came tandem with some very chunky onion dip and boat dip.  The jerky was tasty, with several different styles to gnaw on, it made for a unique gnoshing experience.  The chips were tasty, but about the same as if you made them yourself at home.  Later in the evening we still needed more sampling and ordered up some sweet potato 'tots'.  They were served with ranch on the side and arrived again on the wooden plank.  The tots appeared to have been steamed in Indian tradition.  They were mushy, but in the good sense, and full of flavor.  Overall the food was decent.  The building itself is gorgeous.  The staff needs time to become knowledgeable.  Next time, I may sit and have a full meal.The first time we went to District, it was for Mother's Day brunch.  They had a simple and effective brunch for a flat fee.  Sounded like a great deal and something that my mother would enjoy so we went ahead and made a reservation.

Everyone who worked there was very nice.  They all told my mother "Happy Mother's Day" and everyone said hi.  Our waiter was very helpful.  He kept our mimosas, coffee, and water full throughout the meal.  He even brought out the executive chef and introduced us.  Very nice.

The beauty of having a brunch buffet at a place like District is that you can try so many different things.  I love breakfast buffets and love being able to get exactly how much of each dish I want.  A summation of the dishes tried:
*biscuits & gravy - buscuits were hard and the gravy was lacking in sausage flavor.  Not bad but not good either.
*French toast casserole - tasty with a bit of fruit and chocolate inside it. A little mushy for my tastes but I could see someone loving it.
*Sausage - Schreiners links were a bit spicy and completely amazing.
*Yogurt parfait - served in a martini glass. Blueberries were fresh and tasty and the yogurt was great.
*Assorted fruit - all of it tasted very fresh and was quite good.
*sushi - not entirely sure what I was eating. There was a spicy tuna roll in there and some other things. They were good and tasted good.  Better than AJs.
*shrimp - the shrimp was actually LOCAL grown in a shrimp farm in GIla Bend. Who knew? It was wonderful, fresh, and giant!  Great stuff.
*orange cheesecake - the cheesecake was well done but I'm not sold on the orange flavor. 

In all, the experience was great and their commitment to local ingredients combined with quality service will get me to go back for a normal lunch or dinner.I don't typically check out spas while I'm on vacation, but we received a $75 credit to Nurture, so I couldn't resist.  I opted for the classic manicure and pedicure, so my review is based on a trip to their salon only.  Booking was easy-- we walked into the spa that day and I was able to get an appointment for just a couple of hours later. Vince did a great job on my manicure and pedicure.  I normally just read while I'm at the nail salon, but he was really engaging and we ended up chatting for most of the time.  He didn't cut any corners and almost a week passed before my nails started to chip.  Like most hotel spas, the services here are pretty pricey.  After the 20% service charge, my bill was over $100.  I definitely recommend Nurture but I'd save it for a special occasion... it's an expensive treat.I don't care if it's a chain, Subway makes decent Sandwiches.  They're also all over the place, so it's normally in a convenient location for me.  I don't go to this location very often, but when I do, they serve up some good Sandwiches.

I always get a 12" BMT w/Provolone, Lettuce, Tomato, Onions, Green Peppers, Pepperoncini, Mustard, Mayo, Salt, Pepper, Vinegar, Oil....toasted.  It fills me up for lunch and they make it right at this location.

Return Factor - 80%What I like about F&E is the customer service.  I can't get enough of going into a grocery store to do my shopping and everyone in the store offers to help or greets you.  It is a refreshing change from the big box stores.

I love buying 1 or 2 ready made meals a week.  It is inevitable that I will need to use one that week.  F&E's ready-made meal selections are pretty extensive AND are very yummy.  I freeze them too, they keep just as well in the freezer for about a week.  Not sure if I'm breaking any rules by doing that, but whoopie it works for me! 

I love love love their Greek yogurt.  I'm pretty sure that F&E yogurt is NOT healthy, can't be.  Nothing that tastes that darn good could be.  It takes 45+ minutes to cook brown rice, the fresh and easy ready-made brown rice is fantastically delicious AND takes 90 seconds to prepare.

I shop around and I also find that prices in F&E are often cheaper than they are at the big box stores, especially Fry's.  

This store is always clean and is a great place to pick up your groceries.This is the place we go when we want some authentic italian food.  Their menu is not huge but has a little bit of everything.  Always hommade, fresh, and tasty, and if you're not happy, they will make it right.  They also claim to make something not on the menu for you if you want, though we've never taken advantage of this.  Total mom and pop type place with the family running, serving, socializing.

The place is kind of small and can get loud...so not the best if you're trying to have a serious convo.  Good stuff though.I go here ALOT......

It ain't cheap, so I usually get some type of discount deal or go for lunch. Love the salad bar, great (but very salty) choices. Best salad bar in any Brazilian place I tried...

Garlic sirloin kicks ass, as does the filet mignon. Beef ribs are great too....

Can't go wrong here for food quality, but keep in mind EVERYTHING is loaded with salt. If your drinking and having desert the tab gets up there pretty quick too.

Worth the trip if you never had it.I've gotten take out here at least three times and have never been disappointed. 

The pork and fish tacos and burritos are very tasty. 
I like their green salsa, but it does get a bit spicy after a while. 

You know most places might load their burritos and tacos with rice, cheese or lettuce, but not Two Hippies. They don't skimp on the meat.  The tacos and burritos are loaded with chicken or pork or fish... I wish they would add a bit more pinto beans to their burritos.

I'm not sure if their tortilla chips are store bought, but the chips do seem like they are Tostinos brand.

I find the prices to be very reasonable. Good sized burritos for $4, a three pack of tacos for the same price.

I don't know if I would sit and eat here as the place is so compact. Sure they have there patio area, but overall the place is kind of tiny, so I just usually call it in and pick it up. If they ever serve some booze I just might sit and eat on their patio.I lift the weights and I put them down! This review is only for the actual free weights / gym area as I did not use any of the spa services.

One of the better casino health clubs I have trained at. The Spa at Bally's gym is loaded with free weights, machines, benches, cardio, and dumbbells. It has one of the best selections of Icarian machines I have seen in a casino gym, along with real steel free weight plates, cable racks, bars, smith machine, and a great selection of metal dumbbells up to 100 pounds. I hate those rubberized weights. There is a nice cardio area off to the side with Cybex treadmills, bikes, and ellipticals. A few flat screens hang from the ceiling.

The facility itself is very clean and well maintained. Even though the equipment might not be the newest it looks pretty current, and nothing was broken or out of service. The locker room is pretty sweet. Really nice facilities with hot tubs, saunas, couches, flat screen tv, coffee, and fruit. Early in the morning there are not that many people up at that time so I basically had the gym to myself.

The hours of the gym are 6am - 6pm, so it's good for an early morning workout but I wished it stayed open later for those of us who are working a long show at the convention center and would like to get in a workout when returning back to the hotel. Also, you can buy a daily pass or a three day pass for $51 which includes unlimited access and use of the spa. If staying more than a few days it's worth it to get a multiple day pass to bring the rate down. As with all casino health clubs it's not cheap, but worth it for the quality of the equipment here, and if you value staying on top of your fitness while away from home.

It's not like going to your normal fully stocked gym where you have your membership at, but it's more of a compact version, and better than many of the casino or hotel gyms I have used.The only place in very northern Phoenix that's open at 10pm on a Sunday night when I don't feel like cooking.

Dropped in here with my boy... it was so empty... poor server looked so bored and didn't appear excited to know she had all night pretty much by herself because there aren't many bars around to fill this place at 2am.

Needless to say, the service was great... a little too attentive tho.  Brought out our dessert before I was even done with my onion rings... it's like "whoa... hold on... lemme finish this first."

Burger was pretty darn good though and of course, it's cheap.I like this location of the uber-popular green market chain. 

This place is jumping on saturdays- there's a yoga class with full on loud chants (exciting)- no wonder, I saw some gals carrying their yoga mats. The best section has to be the complete Vitamin & Supplement sections (vitamins, protein powder, stevia, teas, and stress candy). Only two frozen food aisles- but they carry Hawaii's Bubbie's mochi ice cream at $7.99, Amy's frozen dinners and pizzas, desserts, vegetables and frozen dog food (who knew?). The body care section (Burt's Bee's, Pacifica) is impressive- from lotions, gels, face care, anti-perspirant, etc. The cleaning section is equally impressive- full line of Meyer's products (sprays $3.99) and Bonner 18-in-1 castile soap (two sizes $7.99/$11.99). Of course, the salad bar is very good- complete salad bar for $7.99/LB.- lots of yummy healthy options. There's a small seated booth section along the wall, to enjoy your salad, just past the cashiers.Had a blast! Made it a girls night two evenings ago. I made reservations through their website for 9pm on a Saturday night "girls night out!" It was VERY busy so I was glad I had made reservations. We were able to get seated on time, however we waited a while to get our food. There was only one person at the table who ordered Sushi so it is not fair for me to rate the Sushi even though she said it was good. The rest of the table ordered drinks and main entrees. I am not a big meat person more of a veggie lover, though I spilt a  Teriyaki Steak which included Mash Potatoes, Rice and Saut√©ed Veggies. Along with Tempura Vegetables. Everything was great! The quality and quantity was reasonable for an upbeat Scottsdale restaurant. Our waiter was energetic which made it more fun. 

Overall the restaurant was very clean. The staff was well groomed. The scene was hip, young and vibrant.  The bar is small but very packed. Great variety of food selections for those with different food preferences and large selection of beverages. The restaurant is attached to the W hotel so you can mix and mingle in the lounge or upstairs in the patio bar.Most unique breakfast place in town!  All their waffles are made fresh.  You have to option of experimenting with your own creations or trying out one of the MANY creations they have displayed on the menu.  Everything I have ordered thus far has yet to disappoint me.

Definitely try the waffle sandwiches!  Their secret special sauce makes everything taste fantastic, whether it be a sweet waffles meal or a savory one (like the breakfast waffle sandwich or turkey waffles sandwich).

They also make great smoothies and pearl tea drinks, though I am not sure that they use fresh ingredients for all their smoothie flavors.  Also, grab a stamp card so you can get a discount after your 10th combo purchase.

The ambiance of this place is quaint and welcoming.  Colors are bright, displays are cute and bubbly, much like the servers are.  Everyone seems like they enjoy work as well as each other's company.  Definitely reminds me of the cute little shops/food trucks on Taiwanese and Korean dramas.  I love it!

Only reason why this place isn't 5 stars is because it is a little pricey for the amount of food that you're getting, but the special sauce really makes up for it!  It still didn't stop me from filling up a stamp card or two. :-PIf you haven't checked this place out- I highly recommend it.  It's a former Target which has been converted, and is very clean and bright as others have already mentioned.  Aside from grocery shopping, you can have your nails and teeth done, get your hair styled, buy the finest jewelry from your Asian friends in the diamond business, explore Asian art and crafts, and still have time to enjoy some hot steamy buns (I'm talking about dim sum) all before noon!  There are many restaurant options to choose from which might provide inspiration for your grocery shopping list.  My only complaint is they are primarily Vietnamese (at least 4) cafes to choose from, and one Chinese place.  No Thai, no Korean. I've eaten at 3 of the restaurants- MyLynn cafe, Taiwan Express, and a place to the right of the main entrance which specializes in broken rice, has a crazy name i can't remember, and has seemingly 300 menu items to choose from (!).  MyLynn is my favorite- they have a happy hour, Karaoke, great hot-pot and table barbeque, and crawfish during the weekends flown in from Louisiana.  Selfishly I would like to keep this place a secret so I could keep the crawfish and $2 beer to myself, but they deserve more business and it would be great if more Yelpers would patronize them.  So there, the secret is out.  "You try, you like, you buy" (as my Chinese grandmother would say).  I would even take a date here and serenade her with a sappy Vietnamese love song (only available after 8pm)...now if I could only find a date the perfect evening would blossom like a beautiful lotus flower.A nice selection of yogurt and toppings. I usually get the tart yogurt with fruit on top, but they have a variety of other good flavors. Reasonable pricing (mid-level compared to other yogurt places). I've always had friendly service. 

Good product, service, selection, and price... Yogurt Builderz gets my vote.I have to give big kudos to these guys. 15 hungry Yelpers showed up one Saturday morning looking for brunch. They were happy to reserve a big table for us on the phone prior, and were chilled out when half of us (well, mainly me) couldn't decide what to have. Also, given that 15 people placed an order, the food came super quickly.

And mmm the food. I had a hot dog myself, and it's pretty good as far as hot dogs go. It comes with onions and bacon and a mustard mayo mmm. I waffles looked amazing, especially Valerie M's with the berries, bacon AND maple syrup (I know right?!) although all who had them agreed that the batter itself was really sweet (maybe a little too sweet)? The eggs benny looked delicious, and Lou V's healthy but decadent choice of ecruidt√©s with dips looked really good too. I'm pretty sure about 6 milkshakes were ordered, one of which was definitely a ferror roche milkshake (complete with the FR atop), Owen C's was alcoholic (including baileys I believe) and the malteaser shake I got a taste of from David J was mmm good!

So as far as food goes, this is a great place for a big feed, lots of options (all day breakfast and brunch options, milkshakes, pancakes, waffles, Scottish fry-up, as well as sandwiches, burgers, hot dogs, Moroccan tagine, veggies with dips, crepes, desserts... it's mainly American themed but with sprinklings of Scottish and Mediteranean.

Again, big props to the staff. I thanked them kindly for having us in, such a big and noisy and hungry crowd, and they told me it was a pleasure and WE had been great. So big whoop to us Yelpers too - apparently we're a great crowd to have in!

Go expecting American diner and you'll get an American diner with that familiar Scottish friendly welcome. Smiles!Tung Tong .

Keep saying it, Tung Tong!

That translates from Thai to bloody fabulous. Golden (I swear to god it looked golden) Chicken to die for. Gang Keow Wan for my main was great, nice and simple looking dish but very vibrant, both in flavor and colour.

I agree with Laura though, a meal for 2 of us came close to ¬£40 with a few drinks between us and we didn't order alot. Not sure if it was worth the price, but it was the best Thai I've ever had.Stayed here for four nights from 28/12/13 to 1/1/14. The hotel was in an excellent location just off the royal mile, less than a 10minute walk from Waverly station and surrounded by a number of cafes and restaurants, and also close to Princes Street which was great for our Hogmanay stay. Staff were friendly and helpful.

The double room was spacious and had secondary glazing, plenty of plug sockets to charge cameras + phones and the bed was comfortable, if slightly firm. Curtains blocked out light well but slid off the rail easily.

The shower was a slight issue; the floor of it was so shallow that the whole bathroom floor ended up soaking more than once. Once past the reception area, the hotel was very warm, a little too warm for me but I don't like my room too hot. Walls seemed pretty soundproof but noise in corridor travelled into the room easily.

The staff allowed us to leave our bags at the front desk after we checked out at no extra charge, which was a great advantage as our train was not due to leave for another two hours.

Would definitely stay here again as the location is excellent and hotel is comfortable.This small shop has a good variety of cute and small gifts- especially useful for that last minute birthday present that won't break the bank. I usually head here to get a fun birthday card too! 
Here you will find a lot of Edward Monkton cards and gifts, lots of funky earrings and jewellery, funky mugs as well as incense sticks and even cute hot water bottles. Living up to its name, take your time to browse as things aren't always clearly displayed and you never know what you might find.I love the concept. I don't like to do a lot of snow activities so a monitored amount of time in this Ice Cave is perfect. I thought I would be grossed out by the shared clothing but it didn't smell or look bad. The price for admission, a drink and some clothes were reasonable, $25. The fact that we couldn't take a camera in so they could charge for more expensive packages with pictures is what kept the 5th star from emerging. 

The Ice Man drink was yummy, sweet. All the beverage cups are made out of ice and one of them was a dud and started to melt off the bottom so the drink leaked. I would go back with a group of girls again, but not my honey.It's good. Not world-beating but reliably good. It's a bit pricey and it can get very busy. It amounts to glitzed up gastro pub but the atmosphere is rather homey and lovely and its location makes it almost the only game in town. I really love the fish and chips and they do cater for vegetarians with more than just the usual suspects. My husband had the veg haggis with neeps and tatties and loved it. The draught beer is always excellent and the beer garden is nice in warmer weather. I love the skittles hall and generally the walk there after a trot around Dr Neill's Gardens or Holyrood Park is the perfect Sunday but you should book. It's super busy on a Sunday because everyone had the same idea.Ahh, me thinks Tesco at Dalkeith should take lessons from their people at the Musselburgh store. The check out operator was a tad on the sullen side.

T'was here to pick up some food for dinner tonight.Newington's not exactly reknowned for it's amazing array of top-notch pubs. In fact, to be perfectly honest a lot of them are absolute dives.

That's why The Reverie is such a breath of fresh air. For a start, there are no toothless, drunk geriatrics slurring at no-one in particular from the doorway at 11am, which is more can be said for the next pub along the street. In fact, this place is classy and elegant yet still has a comfortable, relaxed feel to it.

Their live music nights are particularly popular. Tuesdays is their folk night, but my personal favourite is their Jazz Night on alternate Sundays - it's a great place to go for a few chilled drinks to round off your weekend before monday morning comes back around again.

The drinks aren't massively cheap, but at the same time the sheer selection and variety of what's available makes up for it: I'm not a huge malt whisky drinker, but if you are then there are almost 60 different ones in stock. 

If you're going for food, I'd definitely recommend their Homemade Pie of the Day. The fillings change based on what's in season, so you know it's always fresh, and you can't get much better than a home-made pie for comfort food.I haven't been to this place in years, but the two or three times I visited Edinburgh, I made a beeline for the Baked Potato Shop. It's cheap, you get a lot of food--the potatoes are as big as your head--and it's very filling and satisfying. Ideal cold-weather food. 

Baked Potato Shop is also very vegetarian and vegan-friendly, like a lot of places in Scotland. And how else can a vegetarian try haggis? They have a veggie haggis potato topping! Now I want to go back, although I'm good on the veg haggis.It is the primary focus of a national museum to collect, organise and maintain objects and artefacts relating to the country's history and culture. This too is the mission of a national library, but concerning the written word and published material.

Edinburgh's George IV Bridge is home to the National Library of Scotland. Sitting across the road from, and not to be confused with, the Edinburgh Central Library, the National Library is a monumental, rectangular building dominating almost half the street. But it doesn't shout about it. In fact, you'd probably even get stared out for whispering. 

If the secondary aim of a National Museum is to be open to all, exciting for all and a place of shared experience then the NLS is, close to the opposite. It's reserved, studious and just slightly elitist. The NLS does have a lovely foyer with a coffee shop, computer access, enquiries area and visitors display but you're gonna have to do your homework to get any further than that. Proof of address must be given (eligibility will be on their website but I think you've to live in Scotland) and a few sentences about why you want access. You get a photographic membership card and off you go. Almost. Everything you take into the reading room must be in one of the provided transparent bags. No rucksacks. No handbags. Pencils only. No food. No photographic equipment. All left in your locker.

OK, you're upstairs. Either you've brought the reference number of what you want from the online catalogue or you use the dedicated computers provided; you bring your request to the desk, and then you wait. 

Give or take, for an hour. 

So try to figure out what you'll need first time round!

Yes, with a staggering collection of old, out of print and rare books and a copy of every book printed by a British publishing house (or at least those with an ISBN) for many decades they've got more than 3 books per head for every Scot. And newspapers. And maps. And manuscripts. So it stands to reason that the librarian doesn't ascend a 200m ladder half a mile down the corridor to retrieve your book. The majority of the books are housed off-site, with hourly shuttle runs for requests by the NLS van. Rumour has it that less than 1% of the collection is housed in the reading room. And as you gaze around the 2 tier room, the length of a good one-and-a-bit football pitches, walls floor to ceiling with books, it provokes a similar emotion to staring at the night's sky. Once retrieved your books are kept on-site, from memory, for 7 days.

You can hear a pin drop inside. The rarefied atmosphere of everyone, mostly alone, researching, taking notes and reading is a step up from a local or University library and depending on your personality can be conducive to work or maddening!

But that's the way it is, and that's the way it has to be. I guess if putting your signature to a form and a doorman were all that was stopping you picking up and interrogating an object in the Museum, the same system would apply. And essentially, that's what you're doing at the NLS.

You have to go there with a specific aim. It's an academic service. And once you understand it, it works flawlessly, meriting 5 stars. However, I have come across a few stuck-up and unhelpful interns and members of staff in the past, so 4 stars it gets.This is a great place to go during your lunch break or after a busy day when you feel like getting lost within many, many books! (Indeed, many lecturers from Edinburgh University have been spotted in here after a busy day in the lecture theatres). There is just something about browsing in an independent small book store which separates the experience from looking at a Waterstones or Blackwells. 

Located close by to George Square, this book shop is full of useful books for students of social and political science. As a political student myself, I found this shop to stock many specialist books which are not available at the main book stores. Books covering Scottish politics and left wing politics (This is a key feature in this shop as Jonny and Lynsey have already highlighted!) are well supplied in Word Power Books. 

The prices do not compete with discount rates on Amazon, but I really don't mind paying that when it is in an independent book shop! 

Keep the independent book shop alive, and dive into the literature on offer in Word Power Books!Whilst I certainly advocate the cause for Save The Children, I must say that on a visit there earlier this week it managed to add further weight to my argument that Edinburgh can be quite a perverted city.

the lacy corset in the window looked far more apt for a seedy burlesque show at best, a street walker down Leith Docks at worst. In fairness everything else inside was pretty much your usual charity shop standard, but such an item was far from what I expected to see in Save The Children's window. I'm quite old fashioned and think such a store should stock comfy, moth-eaten old cardigans and threadbare cuddly toys.

It's all for charity though, so shouldn't complain.Sit at the bar and ask for Sean. Great drink prices considering the atmosphere and very strong drinks. This is also an Absinthe bar if your in for something different. In addition to the drinks they have great local DJ's throughout the week and on weekends. Good vibe, good drinks, great service...Tucked away down a subtle side street entrance, the Mosque Kitchen is a hidden haven for hearty Indian cuisine. Serving locals, students and even the business elite, the luring smell of home cooked, honest Indian fare attracts all. Offering a limited but exceptionally affordable array of dishes, the Mosque Kitchen produces some simple but flavoursome gems. Vegetarians can enjoy a truly moreish Tarka Dahl or a flavoursome spinach and potato curry, whilst those of a more meaty persuasion can indulge in one of the Mosque's daily chicken or lamb servings. With the offering of rice, plain or garlic naan to accompany each dish, diners can anticipate a meal that satisfies any level of hunger. 

A word of warning, though, diners can expect to feast on humble trestle tables, shelter under a rustic corrugated roof and mingle amidst a friendly bunch of pigeons. Meek and unassuming, the Mosque Kitchen boasts unbeatable prices, food of a superlative nature, and will undoubtedly leave you comfortably stuffed for the day ahead.I ran into this place while looking for an Asian market. I thought the name was funny but it seemed it got good enough reviews...so why the hell not. I tried their egg noodle soup with everything on it including fish ball, salmon, pork, chicken and what not...I was blown away....this I was very good and by far the best I had.  My gf tried the pho...well....nothing special but seem like the same old pho compared to other established pho places. Also their appetizers...I tried their pork sausage rolls....well they were okay.

Overall good service and fair price.G approved!Good food and service. Easter Brunch was very good.I have a natural, well I guess unnatural as I am no sort of Island Nationality, to frequent authentic Tiki Bars, but this one takes the cake. In fact, of the dozen or so I have sought out across the country, there was only one other even close to it. 

Started of my 30th birthday there with a group of 9, staff was polite and patient even though it was already pretty crowded there. They make one hell of a zombie too! Some places over power for the reaction of the drink, but they have a killer, creeper mind you, recipe. The way it should be. Unless you have a stomach made of stainless steel, 2 drinks authentic drinks is the max, sugar will be the end for you.

Well worth the drive away from the glitz and glam of the strip but please don't think you'll be able to go in and be "seen" or expect vip bottle table service...yo. Not that kind of place, and we like it that way.Cheesy as hell...wanted to hate this beach bar in Neveda, but I just couldn't help myself.  Drinks are so damn tasty and inventive it is a new fav now.  Better like rum drinks if you come here or it's a waste of time.  Not a big place so get there early to get a seat.I went to Indulge with five friends after our Saturday CrossFit workout for a little protein and we all came away very happy.

I love the ability to customize the burger with pretty much whatever you want on it via their pads with all the options; you simply check the items you want. You can view the options at the Indulge Burgers web site - just click the "Menu" menu option and select "Do It Yourself". You can also choose from their selection of "pre-built" burgers. They have other options on the menu such as salmon, grouper, fish tacos, pulled pork as well as some veggie options. No one in our group tried any of those.

I ordered a customized version of the Vesuvius burger and had it wrapped in lettuce. I selected the premium cheddar, mayo, mustard, ketchup, grilled onions, pepperoncini, roasted peppers and honey cured bacon. They warn you that the cheese in the Vesuvius burger is hot (temperature, not spicy as another review alluded) and they aren't kidding, so consider yourself warned. When it arrived, the burger was placed in between multiple triangular pieces of lettuce which were sufficiently strong to hold my burger and its toppings. As someone who eats the majority of his burgers on lettuce, this was a nice touch as at so many places the single piece of lettuce isn't enough to keep the meat from falling through. The ketchup, mustard and mayo were served on the side. While some may not like this, I personally like being able to put on as much or as little as I like.

The burger was delicious. On the first bite a good bit of the cheese in the middle squirted out the side. Fortunately most of it stayed on my plate, so I was able to eat it. Some ended up on my hand (and it was hot as advertised!), some sadly ended up on the table. Not sure if there's any way to prevent it from "leaking" but be sure to take that first bite over your plate! The burger was juicy and I can't tell if it was because of the cheese in the middle or the meat itself and I'll have to try another burger without the cheese in the middle and compare. In addition to being juicy it had great flavor - all my toppings combined to make each bite outstanding. Some burger purists may say you don't need toppings but to me the melding of all the flavors is more important.

For a group of six of us we ordered three orders of sweet potato fries (although only five of use ate them). We probably could have gotten by with two since we ended up with leftovers. The cinnamon marshmallow dipping sauce is good, but since we're all sugar/carb conscious and it's loaded with sugar we all ate it sparingly. The fries themselves were crisp and good enough to eat without sauce.

The service is where I took off one star. The good parts of the service were that our server was very knowledgeable about their gluten free options which were important as one member of our group is extremely sensitive to gluten. Our drinks were refilled fairly often (a good thing) except for the first round of refills which took a little too long. I freely admit this is a minor quibble. The other knock was that once we'd paid the bill we had trouble getting a server's attention for a box and get us some change for a twenty. Again, this is not a huge deal.

The decor, one of my least important things in a restaurant, was nice. It's open, there's not a lot of privacy and it can be a bit loud but your'e there to eat a burger, so who cares?

I'll definitely be going back.This place is really good.  There are five meats (pork ribs, beef ribs, fried chicken, catfish, and perch), and with your meat you get two sides (e.g., collard greens, black-eyed peas, sweet potatoes, mac and cheese, sauteed veggies) and a bread (corn muffin, hush puppies, or dinner roll).  This is for about $8 combined, and you can also order the sides separately.  Plus there are desserts like sweet potato pie and lemon cake.

Doug cooks up all the dinner food in the back, and his wife makes the desserts and does the table service in the front.  That is pretty adorable.  The food is good - no crazy frills, not particularly refined, but solid.  The fried chicken is particularly tasty, with a thin but very crispy skin and super juicy interior.  I also thought the mac and cheese and collard greens were highlights.  The pork ribs were actually underwhelming at the restaurant, but they were significantly better heated up at home the next day.

There are about 10 tables in the storefront, but you can also do takeout.  There was not a lot of business when I was there on a Wednesday night, probably because the location is kind of out of the way.  But, you should make it a point to go.  In my opinion, Doug's is a clear winner over Kip's, even though Kip's is also good.I was expecting SideBar to be all hype after the reviews that I had seen and even from my judgment of this book's cover as I have driven past it many times. A nice, chill bar in the same building as a Pei Wei and Starbucks? Well, I'm currently chewing a fat slice of humble pie. This is hands down one of the best lounges that I've been to in Phoenix.

The second I walked up those narrow stairs I was surprised to find this shoe box of a lounge. Don't let the space discourage you at all though, you'd be a fool to let that happen. The interior and decor are very stylish while at the same time they set a vibe that sets you at ease and allows you to enjoy your drink. I came here on a weeknight so I don't really have a clue as to how it is on the weekends or how crowded it then. Based off my experience however, I found this to be a great spot to bring friends for conversation and drinks. 

I ordered a Manhattan, and while it was a bit heavily mixed, everything else about this place really made it a great experience. SideBar doesn't really offer any to eat besides some smaller finger type foods like hummus. A complaint I had about the hummus was that it came with pita chips rather than regular pitas, but that's a small complaint given that I had an overall enjoyable experience.

SideBar, you've found a new patron and a new spot on my favorites list.Great food, selection of  beers and service keeps me coming back. Try the the Poncho Villa (aka: Mexican Hamburger).I liked the place.  I can only say that the service was wonderful and I thought my Irish Nachoes were pretty tasty.  I didn't get to have a "drinky" but if you like beer this might be the place for you (having taste-tested several varieties from patronizing friends).  It's pretty upbeat on a Friday night and thought that downtown Chandler was a fun place to be (much to my surprise).  Grab a few good friends (or 10) and go.I have to say that what makes this place memorable to me is the owner Tony... he is a crack up whether intentionally or not and very friendly.  The pizzas are huge and quite good.First time and enjoyed the lunch experience with the "prison" dressed waiter.  I obviously wasn't the first to notice the "uniforms" and asked where was Sheriff Joe's pink underpants.  He almost responded with a show and tell but refrained from exposure.  While waiting the grey cracked large beam ceiling, blue colored upholstery and miles of small tile on the wall make for a contrasting visual experience.

I started with a draft XX larger  and started munching on thick and tasty chips.  Muy bueno with a large portion of mild salsa!!! I then ordered the ahi seared tuna with two soft tacos & black beans.  Muy bueno with small chunks of tuna and chopped veggies - just the right combination of flavors and color!!!

While eating it was hard not to notice the waiters with horizontal striped shirts and casual blue/grey jeans.  Most of them carried a holster for their order books plus an extra towel or two hanging just below almost to their knees.  The towels came in handy for clearing tables and seems like a good idea for other restaurants to  adopt - especially in AZ.

I will have to return at Happy Hour between 4 & 6 sometime soon to see how the inside meets the outside via glass garage doors plus half price margaritas.Sexy Museum!

On my last trip to Vegas I was trying to find stuff to do that is fun and cheaper than gambling. Additionally this is a non profit place so its tax deductable LOL seriously! 
In an attempt to limit my time spent on slot machines and card tables, I yelped some alternate things to do for fun and found this place. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ev1SC6q8AolQWix0n577sg?select=YO2XeytGnySkqj0MRiwuyg#nS2C-9-m1bWaMhm8qvb8aA

Ok so curiosity killed the cat but I had to find out what this was all about. And let me tell ya this place is a gold mine of goodies that has something for everyone.

The place has a huge display of all sorts of things pertaining to sexuality from brutal stone tribal deflowering tools to vintage sexual stimulators to modern day sex toys. 

There are tributes to modern day sexual pioneers like Hefner and Flynt as well as homage to todays porn actors and actresses.

They even have a reverse theater in the round featuring movies from the 20s thru the 70s. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ev1SC6q8AolQWix0n577sg?select=je9yXDiPizYyFRHcE_lyXg#zCw6wzIFVaK_qfPeuOqIMQ

The art collection upstairs (sorry no pics) has some truely amazing works of art and photography, including a fantastic vagina picture picture collection (Petals) that runs along a complete wall and highlights both beauty and contrast. Ever seen a 4 foot golden penis? Minature carved ivory Japanese sex idols? 

And hey the gay community is not left out, there are vintage films, book collections and some beautiful lesbian erotica paintings.

There was an interesting collection of newspaper clippings highlighting the continual run ins our polititions, clergy, and public figures have with the law.

This would be a great spot for a date night ... really. And if your date goes really, really, really well they have a special wedding chapel/honeymoon deal they rent out. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ev1SC6q8AolQWix0n577sg?select=je9yXDiPizYyFRHcE_lyXg#DG3AFR9MNLcoZxxBQisVPQ

They have a small gift shop and a private library for students. This is a pretty cool place I'd visit again. They even have the Yelp sticker of approval on the door. And I owe this cool discovery to my VBC Canadian friend Yvonne F. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ev1SC6q8AolQWix0n577sg?select=je9yXDiPizYyFRHcE_lyXg#QiNoFi8JAQJ1Lfv4G4hAJA
So go give them a visit and dont forget to UFC (FUC) this review!
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ev1SC6q8AolQWix0n577sg?select=eemni2j3d2ebPYkrh_Nj7g#eemni2j3d2ebPYkrh_Nj7gGreat value for your money, decently priced, pet friendly and clean.  I only stayed one night with my friend but it was very convenient, easy to locate and we had a pleasant stay.  The staff was very polite.

If you get a chance try Postino's (about a mile away) for some great bruschetta and panini sandwiches.It took me way to long to get to Daily Dose, and it's taken even longer to get to my review, but my one resolution this year is to get caught up!

Stopped in for lunch with my husband since we were already parked nearby.  While the restaurant is fairly small, we were there at an off hour so no wait at all!  We shared the cobb salad and the ancho chili reuben.  They initially brought one salad and the sandwich was split for us.  I foolishly assumed the salad was to be shared until a second one came out.  Are you kidding me?  How big are these salads?  Pretty darn big, and pretty darn good.  Plenty of bacon and blue cheese, and no skimping on the avocado either.  Unfortunately, they don't come in half sizes which is too bad if you're not sharing because I can't imagine being able to finish one (and I can eat) and leftover salad just doesn't work.  Not to mention it's not easy for me to order a salad to begin with.  I have good intentions, but as I open my mouth to speak, something like "chimichanga" comes out instead.  The reuben was good, but a little dry.  Next time I'll ask for extra dressing on the side.

I'm looking forward to going back and trying that french toast Julia T raves about!Lots of spring ball fans here, I see SF gear everywhere!

Ended up getting the Southwest Flannel Hash ($10):  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HCCg-rVnHQ2FI6lHs_LvUQ?select=1x1RZ-jpHgil1l7aoTQ4zw

I must say, this hash was very tasty!  The corned beef was cook and seasoned nicely, and the portion was generous.

Ancho Chili Reuben (I think?):  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HCCg-rVnHQ2FI6lHs_LvUQ?select=iruecxnja3wL0c6uAKeVWQ

Only got to take a small bite, but it was good.  

Irrelevant complaint:  Didn't like the whole cucumber slice in the water deal, it was NASTY!  But that's minor and won't stop me from coming back.Holy, yum.  I was able to have brunch here, when I was in town for a wedding, and I'm sure glad I did.  

For brunch, my boyfriend and I both ordered omelets. The omelets were pretty standard fair, but with big portions and cooked well.  This place really excels in the details more than anything else.  The water is infused with cucumber, which makes it refreshing and just that much more special.  With your meal, you get toast, potatoes and your choice of side, where most places make you opt out of potatoes if you want something else.  The meal came with a side of rosemary creme fraiche that was absolutely delicious.  I love rosemary and the condiment meshed well with both the omelet and potatoes and infused a rosemary tang.  The potatoes were cooked well, no soggy home fries here, and the fruit was a nice mix of watermelon, grapes, and pineapple.  But the real star of the show, and the reason I hope to eat here again is the jam.  Oh my goodness, this jam was homemade and absolutely excellent.  It was filled with fresh berries and elevated a normal piece of toast to epic proportions.  I want some more just thinking about it.

The food is solid, the staff attentive and friendly, and the jam phenomenal.Surprisingly a great Starbucks considering its in a Safeway...it has lots of sitting room and is located in the Signature Safeway. It is conveniently located in the Biltmore area. Right behind this place is a great breakfast joint to.If you are reading this today is your lucky day! Truly. I am an on again off again food snob. Maybe reformed. But no.
 Fifth time there, time to review. I'ts a simple format. Eat Meat! The dinig room at night is like a dance floor of waiters holding there meatsticks and offering it up to our hungry mouths. Ok, that looks like a porn intro.... but it's true. So for now call me Brandon St. Randy cause I want the meat they got. First off skip the salad bar please. This is a place to get your protein, nothing else. The slad bar has all kinds of frou frou hearts of palm, and aged romano. Sissy shit. Here at Fogo it's meat only. The house specialty here is the "picahna" and it is so good. It's like the best part of bacon fat on top of juicy sirloin. Make sure you get good slices wth a good amount of fat cap. Skip the chicken legs.....boring. All other cuts of meat are delicious. Do not pass on the Brazilian Limeonade!!! DO NOT! It is bottomless and so damn tasty, just needs a good rum in it. 
 Inexpensive for what you get. Make sure to turn your service card to OFF or there will be a dancing meat stick waiter on one of your elbow's.
 They offer excellent sides. Caramlized Bananas, Grilled Polenta and you can ask your waiter for spicy dipping sauce, it is not on the menu or offered you need to ask. The varietes of meat include Top and Bottom Sirloin, Tenderloin, Pork and Beef Ribs, Chicken Drums, Lamb Chops and Chicken wrapped in Bacon. For me, it's only the Red's....Meat that is!Fogo de Chao is the destination for one thing and one thing only: meat sweats.  What an incredible meat experience.  Fogo knows their meat and knows how to cook it.  

One warning before we get going, if you drink soda they serve it by the can and don't tell you that until it arrives.  I would opt for water, iced tea, alcohol or nothing.  

When you start you will be tempted by the salad bar, I totally get it, it looks gorgeous with plenty of selections to choose from.  It is absolutely beautifully presented and for those of you new to this experience the salad bar is a siren and you are a sailor on a ship that is about to jump off and make crazy mad love to it.  In this analogy allow me to be your captain who tells you to cover your ears (or eyes in this case) my fellow man and keep the course, the real prize is the meat.  So if it the meat you seek, avoid the temptations of the beautifully kept and maintained salad bar and wait patiently for the meat.  

Onto the main course.  You will have so much to choose from and after a few minutes of basking in the euphoric aroma of grilled splendor I ask that you maintain your discipline... the first thing that will be brought to you is sausages and grilled chicken.  They are good, yes indeed, but I ask you to resist a little longer, pass them up, tell them you want the bacon wrapped filet, tenderloin, or.... the HOUSE SPECIAL!   Oh yes, my friends when you refuse one last temptation a wave of meaty awesomeness will come and it will not stop until you surrender or they close for the evening.  

This is a feast to revel in.So where do I start? How about the name? How creative and witty. Most great businesses have great names. This is catchy and it caught my eye!

Service - excellent! Our waitress was very attentive and had lots of help with her! Both myself and my girlfriend were very impressed with the service! 

Atmosphere - a mix between a small wrap around bar and casual dining made it a bit louder than a fine dining place. However I enjoyed it! It seemed like this place was the spot on a Friday night. 

Food - Started with the calamari. It was pretty good. Nothing extremely special here, but did its job or two. I had the lobster ravioli. It was amazing. Very good flavor, could not have asked for much more. Great tomato sauce over it. My girlfriend had the shrimp scampi filled chicken and she loved it, I only had one bite but it was pretty darn good. 
  It was our first time there and they gave us a piece of cheesecake for free! It was some of the best cheesecake I have ever had. They serve it with some strawberries, chocolate, and caramel on the side so that you can sample it. It was amazing.

Price - it was a bit expensive, but I knew this going in. Our meal with a glass of wine and a beer was $78. That was with a free dessert. Not crazy by any means, but not something we could do every week. 

Overall a great place to eat. I will be back! 

4/5!Birthday dinner #3 at J & G, and yes, first time as well! 

Reservation at 6:15 on Saturday night and you could already see some early diners are in and enjoying. Three of us were seated at a booth/table kind of setting. Very typical all american steakhouse with dark interior, but the glass  columns in the middle made it more upscale and fancy looking. 

We started off our dinner with the Chilled Shellfish Platter, which consisted a few different kinds raw seafood, they are lobster, jumbo shrimps, oysters, clams and mussels. Out of these five, the lobster and oysters were the best in my opinion. Very special side note, this platter is served with this cutest and smallest tabasco sauce bottle i have ever seen! You have to see to believe it, the size of the bottle is as small as a dessert spoon. 

I chose the grilled Swordfish for my entree, two pieces of grilled swordfish filets on top of miso broth, though it was a bit too salty for me. One friend took the salmon and the other took the short rib. And omg, the short rib dish looks like a dessert, very pretty presentation, i almost thought it was a piece of chocolate cake with some green apple topping. Both had very good ratings to their dish.

And yes, free chocolate lava cake with ice cream for the birthday girl! Compare to Flemings, this lava cake was sweeter, which is to my side, and it was shape like a flower, very pretty! On top of the free cake, our service tonight was excellent!

A little side note, for the first-timer, I opted for self-parking as I always do, I had to take two different elevator to reach to the restaurant floor, so you know, it was a little confusing.Humble Pie is absolutely, stupidly delicious.

We came here for lunch on Memorial Day, after seeing it a few weekends ago while we brunched at Tryst. All the patio/bar doors were wide open and we had a view of the giant wood-burning pizza oven.

We decided to be fat (Hey, it was a holiday! MERCA!) and ordered the fries as an appetizer. Holy. The crispy, not-too-fat, not-too-thin pile of fries (Looks can be deceiving: The bowl they came in hid about half the order. So much.) were tossed in AMPLE amounts of Parmesan, red pepper flakes, parsley and lemon zest. I honestly could have made a meal out of the fries and left a happy camper.

But of course we didn't. PIZZA! Continuing the fat theme, we shared two pies: The artichoke was covered with juicy 'chokes, caramelized onions, various diced olives and ricotta. The contrasting mellow ricotta versus the tangy-salty olives and artichokes was delicious.

The potato and roasted garlic pizza was just straight up unnecessary. I mean that in the best way possible. The combo of potatoes and rosemary is just a tasty classic, while the Gorgonzola added a perfect POW (To be honest, I would have liked a slightly stronger Gorgonzola choice, but I know not everyone shares my sentiment). I would have liked the potatoes to be a teeeeeensy little bit more done/crispy, but that's really the only "complaint" I had, if you can even call it that.

The crust on the pizzas was absolutely sublime. Charred underneath, flaky and crispy and almost...buttery? DIVINE. 

All in all, I can't wait to come back to Humble Pie. We need to try so many more of their pizzas! And their fries...once I get to the gym 84 more times.Since this Starbucks is right in the middle of North Scottsdale, you gotta expect great service here. Usually, they deliver! (The four stars is in relation to other Starbucks locations, not coffee shops in general.)

The staff here is overly friendly, which I prefer (better than unfriendly). Some of the baristas know me by name because I worked close by for a year and a half. The turnover rate is as high as any other Starbucks, but those who know me are pretty familiar with my order, and one guy even asks if I want my "usual." I always love that. 

Unfortunately, this location has a poorly designed drive-through that is INSANELY BUSY for much of the day. I tried it a few times in the morning and have waited upwards of 15 minutes for a drink. The setup is just a disaster - the line starts to block the whole parking lot, and since people drive like crazies in this complex, you have to be careful and aware when pulling in or out of an area. Just a heads up.

But inside, the staff is pretty quick, and I've never had to wait too long for a drink. So if you're in a hurry, going inside during busy times might actually be faster.I came here with my BFF on the last night of our Vegas vacation. OMG is all I can say. We walked in and the indoor area was totally empty...umm, ok, I thought. However, we made our way outside and I was thinking, "we've just entered Wonderland." It was a "night swim" night so there were lots of people frolicking in the pool. There were twinkling lights in the trees and house music blasting. Everyone in the place was DROP DEAD GORGEOUS.

BFF and I parked ourselves near one of the outdoor bars and had a few 13.00 cocktails (YIKES- it IS Vegas, after all. We HAD been given two free drink tickets each, though). We later moved to one of the low retaining walls around the "gardens." We laughed, cried, shared our dirty secrets, all surrounded by a glittering, pulsing, garden of loveliness. 

I am certain that this club will be on the top of my "must-gos" when I'm in Vegas. It is just amazing.Excellent food and great service, but the food took forever to come out. Don't go if you're in a hurry. Great selection of vegan rolls and dishes. Family-owned.The logo could use some work, but the interior is quite cool. Chairs are super comfy and the open layout allows you to survey the whole place. My steak was excellent (took a respite from my mostly veggie ways) and everyone in our group was similarly pleased with their meal. Service was great too. It's a bit hushed inside, so probably not the best if you've got a really rowdy group, but we were on good behavior ;).Burgers are awesome.  We go a couple times a month and the kids LOVE it too.  If you haven't tried In-&-Out before you have to give it a shot next time you see one, you wont be disappointed!Awesome. It's a So Cal staple that's as good here in the desert  as it is on the shore. 

I'm sure you've all heard about the secret menu, great shakes, etc. So I'll just tell you how I do it at In-N-Out, and I'll do it with the same skill as they do: I'll leave you wanting more.

DO NOT STUFF YOURSELF! I'm a big guy, and I usually get a cheeseburger animal style and a flying dutchman. Under $5 and the perfect amount. Believe me, the flavors are so potent it's easy to get carried away.

See what I mean; you want more, right? That's the secret sauce...Carve is a nice restaurant, off the strip and semi-casual. They definitely know their steaks, our party ordered prime rib, ribeye and filet mignon and all were very good and cooked as requested. Their bread is delicious so be careful or you can fill up on bread. We ordered salads, which were good and fresh, but too much once the steak arrived. Service was good depending on the waiter, we had 2 servers and one was a little abrupt. This will sound silly but, when paying a considerable amount for food, I expect my leftovers to be boxed for me and the server was just standing there and handing me boxes and bags.Very delicious food. The duck appetizer and duck main entree are fantastic. The pork belly appetizer is also quite good.  I ordered the halibut, the fish of the day entree, but was disappointed with the fish, however the sides were fantastic -- the kumquat sauce and rice pilaf and veggies were delicious. The food is quite expensive in my opinion but it's an upscale restaurant with the decor, food and portions to match so I didn't mind the visit once in a while. Would go again.My bf and I ate here 3 times during a recent stay at South Point. Typical diner food type of menu - but still tasty and fresh. 

I had the Cowboy Special Omelet (which was yum!) and the Huevos Rancheros which was also pretty good. 

Twice my bf got the South Point Special (it was called something like that.. with eggs, potatoes, cheese, and ham or bacon) -- I ordered it one of the times too -- it was good.. and A LOT of food (mostly potatoes). I think I only finished half of mine.

Their coffee is perhaps better than I expected from a diner in a casino. We had many cups. 

They have separate beverage servers because of how high volume they are - there's often a line during the breakfast/lunch times. Service was pretty quick, considering every table was full every time we went.I came here with a few friends for AZ restaurant week.  The place looked quite "posh" with the decor of a Hollywood night club.  We all ordered the 4 course meal (soup, fish, meat, and dessert).  The waitress gave us a list of items on a sheet of paper and told us to cross of things that we did not like.  In addition, we were given space to add additional feedback.  I crossed off things I knew that did not sound appetizing such as duck, barracuda, and sweetbread (cow testicles).  In addition, I mentioned that I wanted lean meats.  

The great part is that everything was a surprise. I ended up getting a tomato basil soup, halibut with spicy wild rice, kangaroo, and pecan pie.  I am going to Australia in a few months, and I got a flavor of kangaroo.  I have never tried a red meat since I don't eat beef.  I was kind of tepid on how it would taste, but it was flavorful and cooked medium well as I asked.  I was just hoping my stomach would not be jumping around like a kangaroo.

My only complaint is that they did not have some other meats such as chicken.  I know chicken is not an exotic or expensive meat, but it is always a good alternative in case people can not handle the exotic items.I went to Karve for the first time yesterday & struggled to get out of bed this morning. I did an unlimited month at Pure Barre in Minneapolis in May but haven't taken a class since then, so it helped to be familiar with the workout but it was definitely different.

The studio is in a great location with plenty of free parking available. It's beautiful inside & was very clean. Since it was my first class, the teacher showed me around the studio. It's super nice that they have lockers available! 

So, like I said, the class is similar to Pure Barre in the sense of the overall flow. Started with arms which was tough - very glad I had 1 lb weights when 2 lb felt like 200! I was surprised we were only at the barre for a 4 or 5 minute (per leg) sequence and didn't utilize the ball at all. However, clearly that was enough because my legs could not stop shaking & I'm definitely in pain right now.

Good amount of stretching as well as a great ab workout as well!

The check-in offer on Yelp is for a free class - but know that it is for when you refer someone to purchase a membership. However I've seen classes featured on Groupon Now for $10 (for weekday mornings) so it's a great excuse in itself to give it a try!This is beautiful and great but a bit pricey. I want to say I dropped ¬£18 to enter. 
I recommend going around 12.30. This way you can get acclimated and find the canon. The fire it off at 1pm. 
Definitely worth it!! 
Take your camera and walking shoes!!Die Princes Street Gardens wurden im 19. Jhd. angelegt, als der Nor Loch f√ºr die Erbauung der New Town trockengelegt wurde.

Viele Blumen, B√ºsche und eine gro√üe Gr√ºnfl√§che machen diesen Park zu einer Oase der Erholung, wo sich Touristen und Einheimische zum Ausruhen treffen. 

Am Rand des Parks steht das Sir Walter Scott Memorial, ein beeindruckendes Bauwerk √ºber den Dichter der Stadt.

Verkehrstechnisch ist er sehr gut erschlossen. Direkt an Waverly Station, quasi der Hauptbahnhof Edinburghs, gelegen halten hier s√§mtliche Busse und die Tram (ja, in Edinburgh gibt¬¥s auch eine Tram)I don't care if it's a tourist bar, I wanted to spend my last night in Edinburgh at the World's End!! I must say, i was very impressed by their food. I ordered Beef ale pie, and it was fantastic! mashed potato wasn't as great as the server recommended, but i didn't care much. My friends ordered chicken with haggis and something else I don't remember, but they all loved what they got. And Whisky. Yes. It's hard to believe a dram of single malt is cheaper than a pint of beer/cider, but it's true. I tried 2 different single malt, which I don't normally do, but both of them were really great. I had a great time there, great food, great whisky, and great company!CLOSED! This McDonalds has closed. Gone are the days when I used to conveniently walk here from work to pick up a drink on my break or get some coffee in the morning. Apparently the sales at this restaurant were not enough so it moved to a new location in a more centrally located area with easier access for customers.
Funny thing is I still see people try to go through the drive-tru and park to go into the restaurant.i admit it, i'm a girl who enjoys the finer things in life.  a designer handbag, chanel no 5, and a glass of champange, so frankly it's rather hard to dislike a shop where i can get all three of these items while being treated like royalty.

admittedly though, i don't shop in Harvey Nics.  working for the public sector my salary just doesn't stretch far enough to buy a pair of shoes that costs me the same amount of money as my monthly rent (i wish it did though!)  but this shop isn't snobby and no one there knows i can't buy that gorgeous designer dress so i'm free to browse and look at all the pretty items at my leisure.  i love that this store is all chic and modern looking with clean lines and frequently changing window displays.  the christmas winter displays are seriously fantastic!!

but my favourite part of this shop is the 4th floor (aka the floor where i can actually afford things!)  i've been to the bar here and the restaurant both of which i've enjoyed very much.  i've always had a quick lunch at Yo Sushi and a cupcake treat at the chocolate bar across the way.  then there is the food shop with a gorgeous deli counter that features freshly made soup and sandwiches that are quite reasonably priced.  there are also loads of deli meats, cheeses, and olives.  AND there is a gourmet chocolate counter where you can make up your own box AND there are AMAZING cupcakes you can take away!  yes the cupcakes are a wee bit pricey but they are worth every penny, so delicious!!  i also enjoy a quick browse through the other specialty food and alcohol items they have available.

this is a shop for the finer things in life, a place to be savoured and enjoyed but perhaps not a place for the every day.  thankfully i have John Lewis for the rest of my life :)I love this place!
The staff, in particular the bartenders are awesome! My husband & I go fairly regularly but even if we haven't been in a while they still remember what beer we drink when we sit at the bar. They always suggest different menu items for us to try and their suggestions are always right on. 
The food is always great. Of course I will always think Hooters wings are the best but Buffalo's wings are a close second. I enjoy their huge variety of sauces too. 
The atmosphere is great, especially if you are into sports. I love going during football season and watching a game while drinking an ice cold Blue Moon. 
The place itself is clean and kept up. The restooms are always kept up.Good place to grab a bite and wait for flight, nice staff and the food was not bad at all. Its not coffee shop food but its good.You can never go wrong with a Bobbie!It's easy to get carried away about the Fringe and just roll out the superlatives, but sometimes a sense of perspective is needed. It may be the most high profile event in Scotland, but deep down the local consensus has always been that while it's great that Edinburgh gets to host such an event, it's not so great that for a month of the year locals should feel alienated and often patronised in their own city. The festival is run by luvvies from the South East, for luvvies from the South East, and with each passing year the trend for quantity over quality becomes more prevalent.

Comedy now seems to be the main focus, and having sat through some gems of conceptual theatre that include people rolling around the stage in tinfoil, and at another show sticking tampons to their heads, I must say I'm quite relieved. As pretty much every comedian you've heard of is likely to be here, it's easy to pick a show you know you'll like, but it can be fun to risk the tumbleweed and take a lucky dip. As a pointer for quality, simply looking at the posters and flyers can be a good bet. If there's a mention of music, magic or any other gimmick, or the comedian is grinning inanely, then it's likely the show is lot less amusing than they think it is. If he looks miserable and tortured, then you'll be rolling around on the floor in no time.

If you're visiting The Fringe then you won't be able to avoid the swarm of street entertainers that plague The Royal Mile. So far this year I've seen:

Guy dressed as a cat, playing guitar.
Woman painted white, pretending to be a statue.
Guy dressed as a donkey, playing guitar.
Guy attempting to squeeze entire body through a tennis racket.
Guy dressed as a ghost. Playing guitar.

While the Fringe does indeed bring some very deluded and self-absorbed souls to the fore, there is so much going on that even a whole street of guys dressed as sheep, playing guitar couldn't detract from it too much. With hundreds of shows on every day, there's never a moment goes by when there's not something worth seeing, and the general buzz, atmosphere and increased profile of the city just makes it a good place to be. In cliched terms, you can just walk down the street and really feel that things are happening. It's rare that you get to say that in Scotland.My children (8 & 10) LOVE this place. Every time they get any choice/input on where to go for dinner IHOP and Cici's are mentioned.

My son (8) thinks the "You just order a pizza with whatever you want and they bring it to you for FREE!!" I tried explaining that I paid for him to get in...

Anyways Cici's gets 5 stars from my kids and 3 from me.For a cheap pizza buffet, it was surprisingly good! My husband and I really enjoy this when we are over getting fast food, but still trying to eat on a budget. The food itself is good for the price. It's not the best thing we've ever had, but still good! The dessert is pretty good as well. We really enjoyed pretty much all of the food so we are happy customers and will return to this location again. 

As for the arcade.... we are extremely upset with the stupid claw machine. IT IS BS Y'ALLThe food is pretty good, definitely above the average and has some different choices. I've had the eggs benedict and costa breakfast burrito (chorizo) and both hit the spot. Very fresh and tasty and the coffee is quite good. 

But what really sets this place apart is the dining experience. I really enjoy the fast casual set up--order, take a number, get your coffee, juice, etc., and wait for your food. There are plenty of tables and the system runs smoothly and efficiently. This process makes me want to go here more than other breakfast places, even ones that may have slightly better food. At the end of the day I don't want to wait an hour no matter how good your frittata is.Aloft's style is interesting and cool--all the touches have that space-age bachelor pad look that is a little bit futuristic, a little bit retro.  The rooms aren't huge but they do the trick--the beds are comfy and the TVs are huge.  The amenities are kind of basic (very very small closets, for example), but all the important stuff is there:  great big flat-screen TV, free wireless access, nice bath products, free bottles of water.  The pool and gym are small but well-accoutred.  The lobby bar is very cool, though I did not patronize it so I can't say more (the people there were so young that it was hard to believe they were of drinking age, so if you're older than 30 you'll likely feel like a senior citizen there).

The overall feel is a bit cheap-y; as one other reviewer said, it's kind of like a poor (or at least non-wealthy) man's W Hotel.  The finishes feel like they came from IKEA, which is not bad but not impressive either.  Then again, it's not like you're paying the same price that you would for a luxury hotel, so the cost/quality ratio seems about fair.

If I were to come back to Tempe, I'd be happy to stay here again.A fresh update for a fresh new set of clothes.

Last time around, I complained that the clothes didn't quite work for me. I'm not sure if the cuts changed, or if I've been hitting the weights harder (I have), but the classic v-neck t's seem to work much better now.

The organic cotton is about a dollar more, and the softness tends to last longer (at least 20-30 washes). 

The staff is much cooler now too. Much friendler, and more helpful.

Way to step up your game American Apparel!The hotel is very nice and clean, but there is not that much going on here... Also management is very disorganized! Took forever for my room to get ready, and then they gave us a room that was not ready. But at least I ended up getting my stay for 2 nights comped! So can't complain about that!we extended our vegas trip a day and got a room at the Aria.
GORGEOUS hotel!! the room we stayed in was hands down the best room i've ever been in on a vegas trip. the room was furnished beautifully and youre able to control everything from the lights to the curtains from the tv or control panel on the night stand. we ordered room service and the food they brought up was sooo delicious! except the potato hash that came with our breakfast...it had a weird spice added to it and that just didnt rock my world at 10am. 

at the entrance where Haze is located, they blast some strong scent in the air that's so overpowering you cant think straight. it was so strong it gave me a headache. idk why they do that. that's the only thing that bugs me. aside from that, i have no other complaints. the hotel is beautiful outside and in, and if you can afford to stay at least a night i highly recommend it..!Penthouse was large and modern - see pictures. Free soda and water, a definite plus after long nights. limo rides also don't hurt.Came for a vacation and have stayed in Wynn, Venetian and Palms Place for years. First experience In Aria the hotel portion. Selected corner suite and was very impressed with the suite. The technology was fun the panoramic windows in the bathroom with the giant tub was sexy and the bedroom was very nice. Reminded me of a suite in a W hotel. Suite was so clean the rug and bathroom looked sterile. Tons of amenities. If you choose a high floor corner suite you will have a good time.Aria seems to be one of the "hot" places to stay in Vegas these days and after my 3 nights there I can see why. I don't think any good can come out of staying in Vegas more than 2 nights, but I was actually sad to say ta ta to Aria and Sin City after the long weekend.

Like most hotels on the strip Aria is HUGE. When I FINALLY made it up to my room I was exhausted, but one look my clean, modern surroundings put a big smile on my face. I especially liked the blackout curtains and admit to pressing the button about 80 times.

I visited the uh-mazing gym a few times as well and wish I had more time (and $) to indulge in a spa day. There's lot of food options throughout the hotel. Chill (located near the gym) makes a mean iced latte and I enjoyed a tasty breakfast at Cafe Vettro. My husband and I were going to check out the sushi restaurant, but opted to go elsewhere after checking out the menu and realizing we'd be spending a month's worth of diapers (sorry Baby R) on just a few sushi rolls.

While I was in Las Vegas for work I did get a few hours of glorious downtime at the pool the last day. It was super packed, but we did manage to find some lounge chairs together. The pool waitress assigned to our area had a bit of 'tude and told us she didn't have time to take our order so we picked up some chicken ceasar wraps at the pool instead. 

There always seems to be a new "hot" place to stay when I visit Vegas, but I'd be up for another few days at Aria!Very nice hotel - new, modern and non-smoking! It was nice to not have a casino here. We liked being up on the 29th floor - could see a lot. Loved the automatic shades in the room, the large shower, the quick and quietly flushing toilet, and especially the tub!!!
Prices in the market cafe were a little steep, but that's LasVegas. I appreciated being able to get a latte there in the morning.
We took advantage of the free valet parking. The valets were very nice and efficient. We also got to check in early - wasn't expecting that we could but a nice surprise.Loved this place with the old owners, love this place with the new owners.  Is it the best Chinese food I've ever had? Heck no.  Is it a huge plate of comfort food in a nice atmosphere for cheap? Heck YES!  Reliable, consistent delivery as well.  Grab a family meal, eat for a few days.  It's like every Chinese restaurant in Vegas (outside of Spring Mtn Rd) follows the same formula with the same menu, same coupons, and same 2 family dinner specials, but this place just does it better.  If I want the type of dinner experience that I'm used to from growing up in the Bay Area, I go to Spring Mtn -- If I want a typical Vegas local take out place, I go here (or Chopstix for close to my work).


To the lady upset about a tip being added:  Um deal with it?  I'd hate to see how you fare in a country where this is the norm (try most of Europe).  Rate the food and the service, not a small idiosyncrasy that, by your own admission, saved you money in the end.Nice place for a quick sushi fix. Great smiling staff and wait service. All you can eat sushi I believe for $22 def worth it. I ordered tons of nigiri all bite size you can chew without looking like you stuffed your face. The fish was not smelly tasted fresh to me. Uni was too soggy though. I didn't smell like food after I left in case you wanted to know and go out to the strip to party. The green tea and strawberry ice cream is bomb too doesn't taste like it's been left in the freezer for a long time hahMy favorite AYCE sushi in town.  Salmon skin salad...tuna poke...unagi....ebi...soft shell crab...dynamite...etc...yummy! I just love their food.  We come here almost every week to have dinner.  Wait time is pretty bad though...but it's sure worth the wait..This is such a beautiful area to hike especially in the fall and spring when the weather is nice. There are many different trails to hike for all different levels that one is after in their workout. The trails are clean and well maintained too. Piestewa Peak is very nice to hike on the main trail, however, during the week is the best time to hike the main trail since the weekend you are stuck with TONS of people on this trail. I am a native of Phoenix and this is one of the nicest places to hike within the city.Yes, this ballpark is out of the way compared to the other stadiums in the Phoenix area. But for me, coming from LA, it's on the way!

Great ballpark, not super packed which is kinda nice and always a good time at a Spring Training game! We ordered the Corn Dog which was soooo good! The batter was nice and tasty and perfectly cooked. One of the best ones I've ever had actually! They have very friendly employees here, easy parking, and a guy with a cart to pick you up at your car and take you to the gates. Very cool! The Reds and Indians play here so not a huge fan base here but this is a great ballpark and one to check off the list. Will be back though for sure!For another day of research, I found myself at The Corner Bakery Cafe.  I indulged in a banana bundt cake and an iced tea.  I was there from 3:30pm - 7:30pm and enjoyed the homely feel.  The tables are made of oak and the seats of leather.  It was very comfortable, and the staff there were friendly.  I will definitely keep The Corner Bakery Cafe in mind on days that I need somewhere quiet to work and enjoy a light meal or fresh baked treat.It's a must if you've never seen it before.  

I think the show is every 30 or 15 mins depending on the time of day and the music usually different.  They did a spectacular job in designing and developing it and in maintaining.  Its a wonderful attraction that is FREE!

However, there are several special spots to see it... making it no longer free, but some are well worth it.  Several of the restaurants have some great views.  You can sit on the patio at Yellowtail (hard to get a reservation, but awesome if you have a large party.. or try to request the table next to the window) or see it at several restaurant like Scarpetta and Paris.  However, you won't hear the music but you also don't have to stand outside with everyone else.Service is slow while waiting for the red eye but the pours are generous and they are at least open which, at this hour gets three stars from me automatically!I visited Studio B during my second visit to Las Vegas. I typically HATE buffets, because random people hovering over the food I'm about to eat skeeves me.  BUT, I really enjoyed Studio B.  For $36 you get to eat pretty much any type of food you can think of, and you get unlimited wine and beer, including sparkling wine for mimosas.  

The resort is a bit off the beaten path.  If I remember correctly, it's about 15 minutes away from the main part of the strip, but it is easily accessible by car with plenty of parking. The atmosphere is very nice for a buffet, and we were seated in a section in the far back with a beautiful view.    If you have a chance, take a walk around to the main lobby where they have floor to ceiling flowers that are beautiful and smell amazing.

The buffet has great sneeze guards and is refreshed often, so it's not a messy pile of slop like I expected.   I was a bit disappointed by their dessert selection, but after 3 visits to the buffet I didn't have much space left anyway.   The best part? ALL YOU CAN EAT CRAB.  I don't think I need to say anything else.Good buffet with lots of selection, but definitely not worth the $40 for seafood brunch/dinner.

Not much more than your standard crab legs, shrimp cocktail, etc. They did have oysters, which I did not try. Save your money and go during the weekdays at their lower prices that aren't designated "seafood" dayswat is the buffet in this resort called?

i la la la loooove it.

i feen for it all the time. the last time i been here was even better than the first. my usual fav buffet was bellagio becuz they used to have THE BEST prime rib (better than steak houses) & kobe beef. but the last time i went, all the beef was horrible. the price is better in comparison to bellagio, the selection is good, and the DESSERTS...omg, irreplaceable. their warm crab legs r THE BOMB. i highly highly recommend this place for fam or frenz, plus they have all u can drink wine as well. i can never get over how delicious their ice cream is... no matter where i go theres no dessert counter like the Ms.Love the hotel, pool, wine bar, view from the bar upstairs, and even the cheap little rooms are very nice. Got a great deal on a VERY last second room on a Saturday night. For a locals type casino, this is probably my new favorite. I've been there 20 or so times since it opened, and I'm going to keep going back. 

P.s. Bloody Mary's from the bar in the casino suck. Maybe try a mimosa instead for your "first thing in the morning on a Sunday" drink.I hope to stay at this resort soon because it really seems like it's a great place to chillax. 

It's not so far that you can't go back to the strip if you want, but it's far enough away that you don't have to deal with the huge crowds. 

Casino is pretty good. There are a variety of eateries, the pool looks nice, and the spa is tempting. Definitely a nice place.I think this place has a pretty cool name which is definitely in tandem with its clean, vibrant and almost retro image.  The interior is stylish and modern, but feels a bit ragged round the edge which suits the whole ambiance of the bistro.  I don't have a particularly sweet tooth but they have a huge range of tempting cakes and muffins.  Further, just about everything on the menu is made from ethical sources and its a strong advocator of Fairtrade produce.  
I had the scrambled eggs on toast which had herbs mixed in with it and tasted delicious.  The service was friendly but everyone at the counter did seem to be waiting for quite a while.  Nevertheless, the food is certainly worth the wait and their lunchtime menu has plenty of tasty-looking and healthy Mediterranean options like olives with feta cheese and cured meat.  
If this isn't enough they also do open mic and even poetry events which they advertise inside.  Word of Mouth is a great place to get health, tasty food or even some evening entertainment - well worth a visit.Sushi- love it or hate it you have to agree if you are going to go out and spend money on it you might as well go to a good place that knows what it's doing- especially when it comes to raw fish.

Set in Tollcross, I have to say it offers a great selection of freshly made sushi and if you have money to spare and a craving for Japanese cuisine you won't be disappointed. They don't only do sushi of course, but have other yummy Japanese dishes, great to treat your taste buds too (and for those who aren't all keen on the impressive looking wrapped seaweed and fish).

All I can say is- it all comes with a price but better safe than sorry!It was good while it lasted.  I think it's closed now.  Not sure.I have two major issues with previous reviews.

1) This is not an "upscale" or "pricey" mexican restaurant. Yes, the decor is nice and the building is pretty cool. That does not make a restaurant "upscale". Sorry but it doesn't. Camarones never changed the decor when they switched from "Gardunos" to "Camarones". So previous owner decor doesn't reflect on current owner's level of fanciness. lol

You can get a 4 item dinner combo for $14. Pricey? I don't think so. But mabe that's just me. 

2) They DO have a happy hour. Look at the website. It's M-F 3-630pm. 10oz house margaritas are $3 (refer to part 1 of this review) Hornitos 19oz are $6. 

As far as the food goes? It's a typical mexican restaurant...it's not a Barrio Cafe or an upscale cantina in LA/NY/Vegas (refer to part 1) it's just a really good mexican restaurant. 

I really don't understand all the negative reviews. 

Actually...I'm kinda craving some enchiladas now..Maybe I'll go there tonight.Super busy when I walked in but was managed well. Chicken fried steak is my weakness in breakfast resturants and this one was on par.Went to check this out with a groupon. Food was fantastic. Service excellent. I would go back for sure. A pleasant surprise.McKee Ranch is a fun free place to take your kids.  Only during the month of October do they charge to get in.  I believe it is $20 per family and you get a pumpkin and a hay ride.  I have never been to the pumpkin patch so can't speak on that.  I will say I wouldn't pay $20 to go play there.  The rest of the year it is free and they are open everyday from dawn to dusk.  Usually when we are here there are little or no people.  Just come on in, but make sure to lock the gate behind you.  Also your kids will get dirty so make sure they are wearing play clothes.  

They have goats, pigs, horses, chickens and rabbits.  We bring saltines for the goats and chickens and carrots for horses and pigs.  They also have a small older swing set and some older toys, tonka trucks, things like that.  My kids love those old toys.  They aren't the prettiest to look at but they do the job.  Also I think if you put new stuff out there it would look like the old stuff rather quickly, between all the kids using them and being out in the elements, etc.  I have a hard time tearing my kids away from the toys to feed the animals.  

My son had his 3rd birthday party here.  It was $500 included bbq, snacks, drinks and sides, cake, hay ride, pony rides and carrots to feed the animals.  Overall it was a great party.  The kids loved Cowboy Max and the whole staff did a great job of keeping the party moving and making sure everyone got a pony ride, etc.  I has a few small issues.  First, I specifically asked for a plain cake.  The pictures I was shown the wife decorated the cake and there were little plastic trees and animals on it.  I fully admit I am a cake snob.  I was going to order a cake from Freeds but their quote was more then the whole party so I decided just to go with the cake included.  I asked for nothing to be on the cake and gave them a cake topper.  They used my topper but still added all there little trees etc.  I didn't say anything.  I should have just went with their cake, their way.  Bad choice on my part.  Second, Max made a very long speech during the party going on and on about the ranch and they do parties (duh we are at one) weddings, etc.  I understand it is a good way to get business just keep it short and sweet.  This isn't a timeshare pitch.  Max and Christie (wife) are very sweet and I am sure they mean well.  They both were very nice and took time out to talk to the kids and make everyone feel welcome.this may sound depressing to some of you but I had lunch by myself. I had been wanting to check out the new postino so I decided to go on my day off. It was a beautiful day so I sat at the inside/outside bar on the patio. I decided to treat myself to a mimosa while I checked the menu out. I ordered the green salad with chicken, candied pecans, blue cheese, grapes and pears. Delish! It was fairly busy when I went and at times the service was slow. The bartender was very busy but apologetic for not getting my second mimosa out very quickly. It was a nice healthy lunch, not too much food and who doesn't love a little day drinking on their day off.I have been dying for a good place that delivers that isn't pizza, and DE didn't disappoint! I gave them a call to see if I was in their delivery boundaries, and luckily I was, and I had a few people over so we ordered kung pao, chicken teriyaki, lo mein, fried rice, and pad thai. They said it would take about an hour, and I believe the food arrived in about 50 minutes. It was bagged up nicely and the gent who dropped it off was very polite. I was really surprised at the amount of food and the quality just opening all of the boxes, and I was very glad that everything tasted so good :)

I tried them again for delivery two nights ago and got orange chicken, brown rice, and  pot stickers, all of which were delicious. Will definitely recommend.Been coming here because of the proximity to my house and because they do a consistently good job. 
Prices are affordable- you can walk in but I recommend an appt. Sometimes they overbook and you may wait 15-20 before you are seen. However they do a great job for the value. Worth it.We frequent Nando's and love their food. You get a large portion and complimentary chips. Yesterday afternoon we went for lunch/dinner and the service was slow, it took nearly 30mins to get our food after ordering. (It wasn't super busy either; there wasn't a wait to be seated) Also, I asked for a substitute and they up charged a ridiculous amount without advising, which is  disappointing. I spent about $20 on a $12ish Chicken Flauta meal all because I asked for a side salad, which was literally only lettuce and shredded cheese, instead of the rice and beans and queso on my flauta instead of guac, sour cream, or cream cheese. --that's my normal meal there and normally they sub for no additional charge, just depends on the waiter I guess. Overall, we like their food and will return!I've been to this place several times with my boyfriend just for dessert. Every time that I have been here they always tell me it's about a 30 minute wait but most of the time it only takes about half. I have sat indoors and outdoors. I prefer sitting outdoors on a nice day/night since the patio faces Las Vegas Blvd. It can get loud when dining indoors. The service is great and I never have problems with my order.

We usually get the Double Frozen Hot Chocolate for two. I am a chocolate lover so I enjoy this dessert even as simple as it is. I've tried the White Chocolate Frozen Hot Chocolate but I prefer the regular chocolate. 

Overall, it's a good place to dine and experience the Frozen Hot Chocolate. So give this place a go if you're on the strip and want an icy chocolate dessert.I am in AWE! Why does this place have 3 stars?

I am definitely a fan of any form of chocolate and Serendipity's frozen hot chocolate has to the best chocolate drink ever invented. The small size is HUGE! It will be a great idea to share with a buddy or boo because the portion is huge! The whipped cream is also very amazing, I used to think Cheesecake Factory's whipped cream was the best... oh no... Serendipity is the winner! 

I haven't tried the food there, because there are other places to eat in Vegas. Serendipity is infamous for its frozen hot chocolate. Love Love Love! 

Whenever I make a celebratory trip to Sin City, Serendipity is a guilty pleasure! 

And for you alkys out there, get it with some rum! Hello to a night of fun! :)My whole family LOVES The Bar. They have great food, a classy and clean environment, and a friendly and helpful staff. They have a great menu with a lot of options, and will accommodate special requests and changes happily. I highly recommend the mini corn dogs, tempura asparagus, and chicken bites.I've only been there for breakfast a couple times but we liked the food both times.  We both had omelets which were of generous portions.  The prices could be a little cheaper, but the food is pretty darn good and the staff is friendly.Visited here a few times during our stay at the M. First visit I had a shake made with gelato, mmmm! One of the best shakes ever! 

Second visit I got a chocolate covered cronut and another pastry, an orange/vanilla cupcake thing. Forgot what its called but it had a slice of candied orange with powdered sugar on top and vanilla pudding in the middle! Awesome! I'll be back for more of that!

Third visit was late night, got a sandwich. Part of it was soggy from sitting too long, other than that it was okay.I only gave it four stars because of the chocolate chunk pizookie.  Sometimes I go to BJs at least two to three times a week just to order the pizookie. I LOVE IT. 

Other than that, BJs service and food is mediocre.Came here last night with a friend who was in town. I didn't want to go thru the hassle of going to a club on the strip, and I've seen this place before in passing, so this was the pick of the night. We got there a little early (around 10) so there was no line. There was also no cover which was nice and it didn't look like there was any dress code, but most people looked decent which kept the respectability of the place. There a several bars, A BUNCH of tv's always on a sports game/espn (ya!) and a mechanical bull, which is always fun to watch. I didn't eat the food, and from the others reviewers of this place, i don't think i ever will. The prices for drink were a little on the expensive side so I'm pre-partying next time. A few dance floors, DJ, bottle service (from what I was told) was about $200, which is pretty good. Alot of cougars last night. I mean ALOT. bachelor parties, and whatever else you can think of. definitely a diverse crowd. 

Truth be told the only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars is because somewhere in the back of my mind, I keep thinking about how this place reminds me of a more classy version of saddle ranch at citywalk in Hollywood (which is not a good look). Its a little off the strip, so if you get tired of dealing with the politics of place on the strip and wanna go for something different, this is your place.Place is nothing fancy,but they have their own ethnic decor on the walls. the staff is very friendly and helpful with questions. It was my first time trying Ethiopian food. And I can say that it was a very new and delicious experience. I never thought a vegitarian dish can be as satisfying as a meat dish. I ordered both the meat and veggie combo platters.  Delicious!!! I'm going back again. I took my mother with me as well, she loved it too and said she wants to bring her friends there.  I suggest to anyone to try Ethiopian food before you die!! Lol!! I'm probably going to learn how to cook it myself! The food's flavors were very interesting.  It's definately different from the normal everyday foods.Even though I miss the ahi tacos dearly, I still love this place.  I've since discovered the ceviche, the corn on the cob, the quesadillas, the burritos, oh my!  Everything is always really fresh and VERY tasty.  The staff is super friendly every time.  I can't wait to see what will be my next yummy discovery!The food here is fantastic, the atmosphere is great, and the servers are very friendly.  This is our "go to" place for out of town guest to experience wonderful Mexican food.  Why then do I not give 5 stars, well, its quite simple, their take-out system is pretty mediocre.  My view, either be better at take-out, or don't do it.  We do take out from there often (as we love the food), but beware they are almost always later than expected, often lose your ticket, or the food will be cold.  I think they would be better served by nixing take-out, although I would be devastated since I get it often.  My solution has become, I order take-out, then go and wait immediately, to avoid cold food or delayed expectations.  I will say every time our food has been truly subpar, they have made it right, and that the customer service of this place is far and away the best in the valley.so i had the chicken bella. I had the white cheddar mash. And spaghetti squash marinara.  Mash was great, right hint of seasonings, the spaghetti squash marinara, was bland. had no flavor.  Chicken was good had a parmesan cream sauce, a little hint of spice but i enjoyed it. great addition was the portabella mushrooms. my friend had the seafood festival mix. It all looked good, but didn't taste since it was all crab and lobster, and I am allergic. She liked it. we had the appetizer of Asian Dumplings, suprisingly good. I believe it had water chestnuts, and they were sliced big, so it kind of gotten in the way of the chicken goodness of the dumpling, but that's just me. This place is a little more upscale than chili's and applebee's. the food was great and so was the service. Couldn't complain or expect nothing more, than what it is, a chain that served American Fare. It is the only one left in Vegas. Because the one in Summerlin closed.Casual atmosphere; 2 pork chops*2eggs*biscuit and gravy*fried potatoes, plus a side pancake: g8 hot sauce & SOS from scratch, fried potatoes are tasty.  Coffee was barely tolerable with non-dairy creamer. Gr8 pancake, but served with 'country crock' vegetable oil spread.First time on this location. Very good food and selection for the price. My only comment is it would be nice to get more of the cucumber salad. Chicken and angus beef is definitely moist and well seasoned. I would definitely be coming back.great frozen yogurt!!Hit or miss here. Either staffed well, or you're waiting 15 minutes. Friendly staff for the most part, but there are a few angry teens working on occasion. All in all its not bad.Opal Lounge is one of the better clubs on the overly trendy George Street. There is a range of different nights which are popular with students and young professionals. Thursday and Sunday nights at Opal Lounge is usually the place to be for the young Edinburgh crowd.

I quite like the fact that the bar staff actually make decent drinks, complete with napkin! And they are reasonably priced too. The toilets are pretty cool with huge mirrors to admire yourself in. There is plenty of seating too for the boring people like myself. They offer a range of VIP packages, I don't know anyone who can actually afford these sorts of things but I guess there is plenty of people in Edinburgh who can. Prices for a VIP package go all the way up to ¬£500 so you better start saving for a night out here!Great pizza and the waitress was SO patient with us, as we closed up the place.

We had one of their pizzas with sausage on it and it was out of this world.

The wine selection was pretty good and was in a hip and comfortable setting.

This also is a great date place and I have to agree with another reviewer--it matches up with Bianco's...minus the 3 hour wait!

I still give Grimaldi's the lead...but just by a nose.I love this spot. The menu is so good that it is hard to choose what to order, but the spinach salad and pesto pizza are my faves. Service usually good, but my last visit caused me to drop a star.Guinness served at 32 degrees! 

They have a ton of other great beer's for my non-Guinness loving  friends, and for being a Casino bar, its really not a bad price! 

Just now read the other reviews about these great beers being complimentary for nearby players including the video poker and such at the bar! 

Oooh ya! I'll be back!I'm a huge fan of Indian food. It all started in a place back home in Daytona Beach FL just a few years ago. Since then I've been on the hunt for more great Indian restaurants. I just can't get enough of the Chicken Makhani (also known as butter chicken), Lamb Korma and Naan bread, SO YUMMY. This place was really great. The flavors were great and very fresh. I agree with all the reviews. I do think the service was a bit slow. It seemed the hostess was also taking orders and closing tickets.  We had a show to go to so we literally had to take the check up to the register to pay our bill. I still don't think I have found a match for the place in Daytona Beach but this is very close......Highly recommended, no complaints or disappointments!Great authentic food and service!! Nice atmosphere too. And open until 6am every night! (or should I say, morning) ;-)I live in a nearby neighborhood and appreciate the location of this little bar. There is a welcoming patio in the rear of the bar complete with fire pit and heaters over the table for when it is cool out. They have one pool table and a Golden Tee game. The waitress is always friendly and they never mix up my drink order. Pitchers run about $7.50. People rave about the wings and they have the standard bar grub.Decided on this place for all the great reviews and because it was conveniently located in the same place we would be watching a show later that evening. 

It was happy hour but surprisingly the place was quite empty. We thought how odd but decided to not give it too much thought and ordered a few small plates. We were quickly impressed with what we were presented with. The fish and chips which consisted of tender pieces of lightly battered tender fish and accompanied by chips which were slightly seasoned with salt and vinegar were remarkable. We also tried their grilled shrimp and buttery grits, juicy lobster roll, and delicious tuna rice cracker...all a must try. 

The pricing was decent and just the right amount of food. Staff was a little snooty but still managed to provide good service (can't imagine this place would have the same service when busy though). 

The decor is dark and elegant and to my liking.  We sat close to the bar which was perfect as we had view of their stunning lit up framework of a wooded area, very pleasing to the eye as it provided enough light and just the right mood setting with yellows and dark blue tones.

Although it was perfect for a quick bite, we hope to come back to enjoy a less rushed dinner.My wife and I love this place because it is fast, moderately priced, and great food.  

The first time we ate at Lemongrass, we ordered the Lobster satay as an appetizer.  It was very good, but we did not realize that we would have the option to order dim sum from a cart.  The dim sum is a star at this place.  The dim sum server was very knowledgeable and recommended a few options.  Most of them were from the pot sticker and dumpling family.  Tell them the type of food you like, and your server will help you find something.  You can't go wrong, and each order has about 3 or 4 pieces and runs about $5 each.

The menu is extensive here, and has something for those who like traditional Asian dishes, like my wife who ordered the Singapore Noodles.  I like more Asian-American fare, so I ordered the Beef Chow Fun, it tasted like an Asian version of beef stroganoff.  You could really take the cast iron skillet flavor.  Amazing dish for around $15.  

The service was great, and he had plenty of good suggestions, and drinks were always being filled before we had to ask.Pad See Ew: http://su.pr/15ttFB

I bet I could finish that entire dish on my own. It was that tasty! But dammit, I was with co-workers and I suppose it would've been polite to share. Pretty much anything that involves kale is a quick sell for me. The fact that it was used in this flat noodle dish with tofu was absolute awesomeness!

My co-workers also had the Green Curry with Chicken (which they liked) and the Tom Yam Hed soup. I'll admit, I tasted the Tom Yam Hed which was spicy goodness but I can't guarantee that it's vegan because the broth tasted seafood-y. In fact, the leaf icon that indicated vegetarian dishes in the menu wasn't next to the Tom Yan Hed so that was my bad :/

Gasp!

Oh, get over yourself..."the vegan" just told you that a potentially non-vegan soup was tasty. That's gotta mean something, right??? ;D

P.S. The decor is absolutely fabulous! Contemporary design with ropes stretched across the ceiling. Makes me wonder...if one of the ropes were cut, will it all unravel? Hmm...Maybe you reason why all the doors are closed
So you could open one that leads you to the perfect road
Like a lightning bolt, your heart will glow
And when it's time you'll know at...LEMONGRASS! - Amber Carrington (firework cover)

I was staying at the Aria this past weekend and it was 1:30 am and we hadn't eaten yet for unforeseen circumstances. The only places that were still open at the Aria was Lemongrass and their 24 hour cafe. Without much deliberation, we came here hungry but also not expecting much. 

We ordered the red curry with duck and vegetables and wow, it was a huge portion of duck, pineapple, green eggplant (fairly certain it was eggplant lol), red and green peppers, bamboo shoots, and cherry tomatoes. I was quite impressed by the sweetness of the curry with the tastiness of the overall dish. The jellyfish appetizer that I was happy to see on the menu wasn't good though as it was very rubbery. I've eaten a lot of jellyfish and this was something that definitely looked like it but wasn't quite there. I even tried adding chili sauce to mask the rubberness but that didn't work haha

Now I know the reviews overall haven't been great here but there are positives: A. open till 2 am /// B. restaurant decor is nice /// C. food looks authentic

Honestly, I would normally never choose a place like this to have a dinner when I usually only get 2-3 nights per visit in Vegas and there's TOO many restaurants to choose from. The thing was that all the places I had on my list to try were already closed and we were staying at the Aria and this was open. I'm not sure about the rest of the menu but the red duck curry made for a satisfying meal that won't leave you feeling stuffed to enjoy the rest of the night.I never heard of this place until they opened one up in Town Square. Or maybe because the only other one is in Aspen!! Where the beer flows like wine!!

A couple friends of mine said their French fries are the business.  We went to go try them..... They were out of fries!!!! That's ok tho because I paid them another visit the next day and made sure I had fries with my sandwich or sandwich with my fries.  I got the regular sized Tahiti cold sandwich. (sandwiches come in 3 sizes, skinny, regular and fatty) and I made it a combo.  They fill a brown bag (like what you use to bring your lunch in the 3rd grade) halfway with their thick fresh cut fries.

I liked the food at Johnny McGuires, red and green tobasco to your liking, and ranch if requested. They have some good ranch.  Nice vibe with a view of the movie theater just steps away.  And service was OK. 4 stars!

P.S. If you wear one of their shirts when you order, you get 20% off.I've been here a couple of times and the service and coffee have been consistently good.  This past visit I bought a pound of Sumatra and French Roast.  I used my French Press for the Sumatra and it was very good.  Give these folks a try and don't forget to hang around the wood fire they have outside.Jacky Chan ranks high on my list for places to buy bbq pork fried rice...   Whenever i order it, I cannot stop eating it... it has become a problem... I have also had the garlic eggplant, orange chicken and general tsos chicken... they have all been great... its right around the corner from me, so add convenience to the mix and I will return....I dont understand the bad reviews here....I have been to many a surplus stores filled with nonsense and this is one of the few I have ever been to where every item (well 90%) is crucial.

Maybe I've been watching Bear Grylls too Much, maybe my Air Force Nostalgia Days are creeping up on me....maybe I just wanted to buy a purple heart and pretend to be a maple syrup conglomerate....All of these things this store fufills....

I came out of the store with a few bandanas so I could rep my hood, a kill em all let god sort em out shirt (which I plan on turning into a sleevless), a knife that is also a lighter, and some rope.......I passed on the camo netting this time but next time it may make an appearence in my shopping cart.

Good prices, nice staff, good selection, no nonsense.....I like it anyways....wish they had more digital camo but thats about my only complaint....

4 Stars for potential to grow as I love the warehouse style surplus store, and there was no vintage miltary vehicle parked out front.....Wandered in here in search for a little hair of the dog after a weekend in Vegas. The first thing I saw was a giant sign for their bloody mary bar/unlimited mimosas (automatically +10 points). Not just any bloody mary bar though...it was accompanied by one of the best DJ's I've ever heard. Best mashup he spun while I posted up at the bar was definitely Santeria/Should I Stay or Should I Go. All of us nursing our hangovers definitely got a little pep in our step with these kind of tunes! 

After perusing the menu (even though I wasn't hungry, I saw things like Ore-Ida tater tots,  Chicken and Waffles, and lollipop buffalo wings. Nom nom), I finally decided to give their Red-Eye Mojito a try. 

Holy wow.

Bicardi Torched Cherry, real brandied cherries, and loads and loads of M & L. It was magically delicious, and I downed the first one. Although I only had an hour before my flight back home, I did the rockstar thing and decided to give in for another one (which I proudly carried out in a to-go cup. very tourist-y of me). 

The ambiance of this place is pretty rad...lots of light, great view of the Strip, and tucked away in the Palazzo not too far from the Reservation desk. Also have to note the fun music, awesome bartenders, and a pretty chill crowd. Aside from the bar and standard dining tables, you can also sit in their lounge area in comfy low chairs and benches. If I lived in the area I would definitely haunt this place with friends for brunch/libations. 

Cheers!Came here on a Friday around 11-12ish with a group of 10. The group ordered some cocktails (can't really remember what we ordered) and we ordered philly cheesesteak dumplings, calamari, the burger, chicken and waffles, and the tater tots.

Everything was phenomenal! My boyfriend said his burger was the best he ever ate and the portions for the entree was HUGE. All in all, I think we spent like $30/pp and we had a great time. Also, although the entrees are a huge portion, the appetizers, while inventive and yummy, are a bit on the pricier end.

There's also a DJ for late nights but there wasn't a lot of people so it was sortof weird having just us on the dance floor.

First Food & Bar is a great place for late eats and although hidden away a really great deal for Vegas standards.one of the many places to eat on the strip, and it WON'T put a hole in your pocket!  really like the concept and atmosphere. I don't care so much for their pretzels, simply because I don't like mustard, which is what it is served with.  I did like the open faced BLT, guido wings and the mac and cheese.  

Take advantage of their $1 photo booth while you wait for your food!Came here because the Market Street Cafe was closed for cleaning. So they had the menu from there. Not needed....oxtail soup for me!

  Service good so was the food!Lady Diana's no longer sells my favorites!
No more danish pastry, bear claws or scones. Now they sell mainly cupcakes and brownies. So no more bakery visits for me.

One time I was given a sample of challah bread which was wonderful. Bread is only available by preorder though.This new restaurant was an instant hit when my wife and I went to the soft launch.  I had the sea bass....it was thick perfectly cooked and accompanied by great sides.  She tried the salmon and was equally impressed.  We have been back twice, and the full menu is impressive.  Service is personal and friendly without smothering.  A wonderful place with an ambitious chef......This place is a small family owned Mexican restaurant common in CA (if you're from there) Maria is such as nice lady and the food is quite good and cheap. I've only had burritos here, but they also serve some soup (menudo, caldo de res), enchiladas, fajitas, and tacos. Even though it's usually one or two people behind the counter/kitchen, it's fairly fast service. The food is what you would expect from a Mexican mom n pop place. Nothing to fancy, but just the right ingredients wrapped up in a huge flour tortilla. I especially like their breakfast burritos. 

4 star for quality and price.Good location.Wow, this place has such an eclectic mix of furniture!  Out front they had a crazy red chaise lounge with gold emblems all over it, inside there is a 12 foot long spanish style dining table and a contemporary/modern bed frame.  There is literally something for everyone here.  The best part is that everything is totally affordable and their prices are really low.  I've been to thrift stores that charge more than they do here!  There were a lot of things in here that I wanted to buy but I don't have any more room in my house.  This is really a great consignment store with lots of high quality well priced pieces.  Definitely give it a try!We came, we ate...and I suppose food coma is a sign of conquering the food for our moneys worth. I came with my cousins and we were in during the transition from lunch to dinner so we got to sample both collections of food. 

I like the interior...it has a bit of ambiance compared to most grill spots which like to go basic. The plus is the round non-stick grill. Some people might think it's weird that they only wipe it down with a paper towel, but really it's all it needs to get it clean compared to the usual grills that need to be replaced and deeply scrubbed. I like this kind of grill and the ventilation is decent here so I didn't get too much of that food smell. 

Meat is the game and the meat actually was a decent selection. The quality and freshness was pretty good. 

My favorites: 
pork belly- with a spicy marinate was really nice
kalbi ribs- arent as fatty as other spots, more marbled
tongue and thin sliced beef is always a favorite. 

Cooked items- I like that the foods were more Korean prepped than how some do a Chinese buffet. Came for Korean so want more of those dishes. Tempura came out and it was good actually, but I got it fresh off the frying. Most were okay, but I wasn't here to fill on dishes- I came for meat! 

Service- the service here is attentive and this was refreshing since most Asian establishments don't have this kind of service. The ladies filled out drinks, checked on us often, came to help cook our meats and clean out grill. The service was constant, but was unobtrusive and friendly. 

Let's put the things I have a shtick with aside- 

Banchan- some of the banchan was too salty and some during lunch weren't as cold and crisp as they should. I didn't get to have much banchan after the turn over as at that point I wasn't feeling it. 

Radish wraps- I love these, after lunch turned over, they took them away. :-( I would think this is basic like having lettuce or bean paste for the meat. 

I normally like chikke, the rice cinnamon drink, but theirs was way too sweet. 

Pricing- At $20 compared to other AYCE for dinner isn't bad, but I still don't know if it was a pricepoint I was happy with. They have a much better setup, service, etc. so I get where they need to keep their price higher. I guess I'm just sad I didn't get a little dessert (they have fruit, jello). If I went to Wooche I normally keep the $4 difference to grab something sweet to wash out the palette from the heavy flavors. It's easy to say I'll come for lunch but the kalbi and the thin cut tongue and such is only dinnertime and that's a bulk of what I want. 

I can see myself come back for a few reasons- not as busy, I don't smell as much. I think I'm a fan, but I'm leaning towards this being A-OK so I'll say it's a 3.5 star experience.Fresh rib eye, but the bul galbi could be more spicy.OMGXYZ?!?!?!? I stayed at the Flamingo hotel on my trip and everyone knows that after a night out on the Strip, you are starving for good food. If you do your research, you'll find deals like $4.99 steak and eggs but for those who want a quick bite and on a tight budget, the Burger Joint has a $3 Burger&fries deal starting at midnight! 

The burger isn't skimp though it may be a little dry. The steak fries that comes with it are delicious! NOM NOM NOM NOM! Not too crowded either but shhhhhhhhhhh if you don't want to wait too long! (ironic that i write a review for it......)We found this little place on the way to Ceasar's Palace and the Flamingo Wildlife area from the Monorail Station (had to go thru the Flamingo).  I was hungry and after looking over the menu decided to stop for a quick snack.  I got the 2 slider appetizer and we ended up having to wait like 15-20 min for my order (my boyfriend didn't order anything) to arrive.  There was a waiter that refilled our glasses every few min or so and we never had to worry about refills (it was great!).  Although it seemed like a while for just two little sliders I don't think it was a huge deal.  We had waiters walking by every so often.  The waiter told us about their special glass promotion (we could purchase the glasses like the one we were drinking from for only $2! that was like woohoo for me! so I purchased one to take home...they are the coolest!).  The time we ate here was between 12 and 1pm.  I think the appetizer may have been slightly overpriced $7 (or if your a rewards member only $6) but what food isn't in Vegas?  I thought it was a fabulous eatery and wouldn't mind coming again to try some of their other selections.I guess the shortest way to describe this market is that looks like an abridged version of Pro's Ranch Market. You will find lots of fresh produce, hot and cold prepared foods, baked goods, meats, beverages, and groceries. There's also a nice selection of Mexican cheeses which are hard to find in regular supermarkets. The market could use a bit of sprucing up to make it look less old and more organized; but other than that, it is a good place to shop for inexpensive groceries and Mexican specialty foods.Ate here for lunch/happy hour. Shared a lunch and roll with my husband. Located in the Middle of Mandalay Bay.. Pretty good deal for $20 Bento Box lunch deal.. $5 Asahi. Would eat here again.Since most things in my life have the shelf life of a diary product, I felt the Dailey Method deserved an update. Why? Because I am close to approaching the 6 month mark of being part of The Dailey Method...and I can't believe it!!!

This is one of the most beautiful, graceful, yet OH SO effective workouts. When building up strength, it's easy to get discouraged at times. But, I can guarantee anybody who sticks it out with dedication for the first month will continually see themselves improve. Then, one day you'll be surprised to find yourself getting stronger and pushing yourself to new levels!

The Dailey Method owner is so passionate and has such a talent for what she does, it spreads like wildfire to her instructors and onto her students. I cannot speak highly enough of Linda and her crew and the incredible amount of support they have given me.

My motto in life is that the world would be a better place if more people focused on making themselves happy and whole. The Dailey Method has been an instrumental 'new' part of my life to help me be stronger...not only physically, but mentally. I know many Methoders who would agree. What is there to lose? While you're enjoying your new booty, you can also pride yourself knowing you look darn smart too!!Yummy Cuban food.  We always have leftovers.  The Cuban sandwich is always a favorite and the tostones are a must. Make sure to ask to try both styles of mojo sauce. The waitress was nice to my daughter, but took a little reminding for certain requests even though the place was almost empty when we went.Basic clean Hampton with smoking room options ( I landed up with a smoking room,as that was all that was left but it was cleaned nicely and well -ventilated, minimal smell)
Walking distance to a couple restaurants, good location to other businesses.  Parking lot very full late at night.Great restaurant for french food. We sat outside...which is noisy on a weekend. I suggest people try to sit inside.

Now....the food and wine was very good. Get the tartare and bouillabaisse! Tartare was some meat paste and a egg on top of it. The bouillabaisse is their seafood...only had one shrimp though. 
The fois gras was OK....also had the duck...which I warn it is medium rare...but still good. Get some full body red to go with it.

All in all very expensive.....so use this place for special occasions.The service we received  here was incredible, our order came out in like 2 minutes, but didn't seem to have been sitting out at all. The chicken was amazing, and the waffles were delicious. Love the mason jar drinks, and all the signatures on the wallsA nice little local place, everyone was super friendly.  Love that their batter is gluten free.  I had the haddock, it was just a hair overcooked, but not so much that I didn't like it.  My husband had the cod and shrimp and liked them very much.  The coleslaw was a little bland, but my personal preference is a zippier coleslaw.  The seasoned fries were great.  This is a nice place run by nice people, I'll definately be back.Great grocery store. I enjoy shopping here. Its my favorite of all the grocery chains.

The store is always clean and everything is neatly in place. I hate seeing messy stores. It makes me think employees are not doing they're jobs. Lazy biotches. The staff is friendly and helpful, I always seeing them do their jobs, not sitting around talking. I like that.

They have a mark down sections that makes me jump for joy. Things are expensive and i dont know if youve noticed but the prices at grocery stores are on the rise. Coming in the morning your able to get many items at 50 percent off. 

Items such as;
-bread
-salad
-fruit
-steaks and carnita asada
-lobster ravioli
-premade pasta dishes

I enjoy the fact that they carry many organic items, that reminds me of traders joes. They also have a little area where you can sample different items of the day, that remind me of costco. Their low prices remind me of walmart, not exactly the same price but almost in the same range. Yet you dont have to fight walmart crowds. 

Come here if you want your groceries to be fresh and your experience to be easy.Throwback movie going experience...So my boyfriend has never been to a drive-in (he didn't grow up here) and I decided to look for one online. Low and behold there was one not too far from home. 

Off we were...What a great deal. Movies theatres these days are so overpriced and you usually have to deal with some obnoxious adolescent moron.Whatever things are going on there,it's in their car so its none of my business! 

Sit back and tune in to the set station.Talk and laugh as loud as you want because you're in the comfort of your own car! You pull up to a very large screen and enjoy. Best part its two films for the price of one! Amazing right..The good ol days are here to stay at this place. Be sure to check out the concession building and play some old skool video games in between the shows. Its a great family outing. I love how people bring lawn chairs! 

$6.50 on a regular night & Tuesdays its $4.50 for two movies and dirt cheap popcorn that you get without having to leave your car! 
The con was the one screen was slightly frayed but I believe it was the movie itself because the second show was fine. Also I suggest you keep your car battery in good shape as the couple next to us had to get a boost half way through the movie. Depending where you park the restrooms can be quite a walk so remember to take your potty break before or after the shows!!So...I woke up Saturday morning with yellow highlighter all over my arms, champagne on my pants and bruises galore from slipping on the aforementioned champagne on the dance floor. Seems like I had a good night! Plan b: 1. Nikki : 0.This place reminded me of Cracker Barrel, but the food wasn't overpriced and was actually good! Went here for "brunch" and wouldn't have known about it if it hadn't been for Yelp. Got a ham and cheese omelet that came with home style frys and toast. Also got coffee and with tip was only 11 bucks! I save 5 stars for when I am really amazed but would definitely go back.Been going here for about 1 year...Anita is the best, shes the reason I keep going back.This is one of the nicest gyms in town. Aside from the outdoor pool (I'm not a fan), this gym has all of the newest equipment. I enjoy the cardio equipment with Nike+ along with personal monitors. The Hoist equipment is awesome. The staff is never rude to me and I enjoy the Group X classes, especially Yoga with either Susi, Gez or Rabeeya.This place reminds me of mid-western cooking. It has lots of butter. on everything - even the burgers. I enjoy their custard and cheese curds.For years I have searched for Issan style Thai food close to home. In the past I would have to go across town to get Issan style food. I highly recommend this little Thai restaurant. They have authentic Thai style not the usual Thai/American version that seem to pop up every day.The first time I ate at In-N-Out was when the chain first popped up in the Phoenix area. I wasn't too impressed. I had a plain cheeseburger, and it seemed like just your typical fast food burger. This was before I knew about the now not-so-secret menu. 

I went in again to try their burgers again, this time ordering a cheeseburger- animal style, with a Neapolitan shake. The burger had a soft bun to go with the grilled burger meat, melted cheese, crisp lettuce and fresh tomatoes. Animal style is the way to go, because of the extra depth of flavor from the mustard-grilled burger, extra pickles, and chopped caramelized onions. The extra thousand-island type sauce helps too.

Compared to other fast food chains, you get a really good value for your meal here. The extra ingredients for "animal style" don't cost any extra, and the burger meat tastes way better than something similar for the same price elsewhere. The veggies were very fresh, as opposed to the wilted veggies you find in some places from burgers sitting out on heat lamps for who knows how long.

The neopolitan shake was pretty tasty. It's another "secret menu" item, and while I've never had a chocolate, strawberry, and vanilla shake all in one, this will not be my last!

I wasn't too impressed with the fries, despite being freshly cut and fried. They tasted a bit dry and crumbly. 

Service was very friendly, and the cashier even gave me a cup for water while we waited the few minutes it would take for our meal to be made. Once we were done, another staff member came by to clear our table. Very nice service for a fast food place!This is definitely a weekend full of new favorite places for me.
Revo Burrito definitely topped my expectations. I saw it when we were leaving Delux the day before.
The interior is amazing...loved the decor-from the eco friendly bathrooms to the sinks. 
I ordered the chicken fajita bowl, with brown rice-It's safe to say this is my favorite restaurant brown rice to date-it's flavored with lime and cilantro. Perfect!!
Loved the presentation, and I had the sugar free lemonade.
Service was polite and quick, and we had a nice night sitting outdoors at the several tables they have.
It's open late, which  is great-we have such a hard time finding decent late night dining.
We'll be back!This is a good-quick site to see.  Its not some big adventure, nor is it a long intense hike.  Its not something that will fill an entire day either, but its a good place to take out of town guests for a quick and unique view of the city.  The Papago Park area and Papago Mountains are very cool and very unique looking and when you crawl through the hole in the rock and stand on the other side it makes for a very nice panoramic.  Since it is such an easy and accessible attraction it can often be crowded, which could determine how much time you want to spend there.Great pizza and portion size! Was backpacking around Vegas and it was just next to Tod Hostel and Motel(where I stayed).

Took out a large pizza for a very good price(probably 26 dollars for an 18inch pizza. Great stuff!

Friendly waitress who greeted us.

10/10 in terms of economic value and portion. Will highly recommend it!Let me clarify one thing. Breakfast is my favorite meal but I never real make it out for breakfast cause I like to sleep in on the weekends. Saying this. I was watching Triple D on the Food Network and saw this place. Home made everything. So the next day I had to go out of my way for brunch to try this place out. OE was hard to find but it's between the Ice Den and Mountainside Fitness. 

There was so many good dishes on Triple D I couldn't decide. So I went with Chicken Fried Steak, scrambled eggs, and hash browns. All I have to say is oh my gosh Yum Yum. CFS was so good but the gravy made it great. Gravy was home made with chunks of sausage. The hash browns are home made too and outstanding. My wife had the home made corn beef hash with poached eggs, and sweet potato tots. Great dish too. CFH was really good and the tots was really delish. My daughter had the Wolfpack with hash browns, eggs and bacon. She gobbled it down and the bacon was thick and really good. 

Service was really good. We only had to wait a few minutes to get our table. Once seated, we were served right away. Drinks were refilled on a regular basis. Brunch was so good. I can't wait to go again and try more dishes. All I can say is great breakfast joint so enjoy.Great place for PHO (fah), I had the beef meatball and as an appetizer this rice pancake and Vietnamese spring roll.  Quite nice, comfortable atmosphere, and clean.  Even though its at cave Creek and the 101 (Beardsley) we will be back.My mom and stepdad were passing through town and we needed to eat something good, but close to my house so we brought them here. 

I had the chuletas- it came with two fairly thick and big pork chops and with that delicious green sauce. The green sauce is closest to my moms and I had her taste it and she says it's pretty close. The rice casserole was okay, but I prefer regular rice I think. 

My mom got the mocajete- this is their fajitas. The items were grilled and not just pan cooked which a ton of places do. It's a bit different since it is thrown with sauce and cheese on it. The sauce is interesting with a bit of a sweet spicy (seems like there's nutmeg?) and creamy since the cheese kinda blended in, however I think I want that on the side since it's all I could taste and the grilled meats lost some of it's grill flavor. There's a lot of meat in here for the price. 

My stepdad got carne asada and was happy with his food. He is Mexican and the abuela who made the beans I talk a lot about is his mother- he said this place was good and the beans were good. 

BF got the carnitas which was soft and good. He also got some green sauce on the side since it's a favorite and goes well with pork. 

I love the horchata here since it's creamy and homemade.  

My mom wanted to try their flan and theirs is worth ordering. I hate that most restaurants it's more like gelatin, lots of air bubbles...it's not done right. This is creamy and rich how it should be. 

The hitch  was the service time. The servers here are always friendly, attentive and good about refillls and such however the kitchen was so backed up for lunch. I've seen this place packed more than this and got our food in a timely manner. Lunch became a 2 hour affair instead of a hour. 

I get that this sometimes happens, but man what bad timing. The parents had precious time in passing through so after eating, they didn't have time to hang out for a bit and had to leave. 

It seems like a rare occurrence since the staff here seems to do well at their job so I'm still a fan.Looove this place. Everything I have here is awesome. Quality food and service every single time. I try to get something different each time we go. Pretty authentic Mexican food.nothing like your normal brewery/bar and that is why i like it so much! 
Inside it has a very comfortable homey vibe to it. I really dig the atmosphere here, its almost like hanging out in a friends big living room. You can watch one of the t.v's, play cards or a board game, even bring your own food in  if you want and just chill out and enjoy some good beers. The people who work here and really laid back, this is just an all around nice place to relax after a long day. They do not serve food but they do have a food truck parked right outside each day they are open (wed-sat). each day it is a different company providing the food and they work in collaboration with the sleepy dog. Also have deals if you buy food get a beer for a buck or something like that. They have menus inside for what is served outside. 

Yes everything is dog themed and they are creative in the way they implement it. The beer sampler( GET IT, its awesome) comes served in a dish that is bone shaped..and the names of the beers are dog related etc. 

its just a no pressure come as you are place and who doesn't like a place like that??

oh yeah and the bathrooms are super cool...all metal. have a couple beers and go in one. its like you walked into a walk in refrigerator that's not cold(if that makes any sense) anyway i like em'Megan D., if you slept on twenty mattresses with a raw, coffee bean placed underneath them, I'm sure you would wake up in the morning insisting that the thing was over roasted. I mean, does anything in this city give you that funny, muscle spasm the rest of us recognize as a smile? And really "too many other places to get coffee in this area?" Um you do realize we live in Phoenix right? I'm thinking of opening up a cafe myself and calling it "Not Enough Coffee Places In This Area Megan D!" 

I just dropped in for the first time yesterday and christened it with one latte, a three hour writing sesh, a smoke break or two, a little bit of coffee shop eaves dropping and even some hardy conversation with the totally friendly baristas. 

The latte was dead on. Smooth and naturally sweet. The ambiance, a calculated balance of place to be seen-idness and just put your headphones on and zone out-ability. And those giant windows, that swirling breeze, the purple and orange sunset, I dare say I want them for my own.  

I'll be back soon for sure with a giant muscle spasm on my face.Surprisingly nice hotel near Sky Harbor Airport. Sort of reminds me of an upscale European styled hostel with its common couch areas surrounding the lobby, free wifi, kitchen style snack bar where you can pick up breakfast and a fancy coffee maker that does coffee and hot chocolate. There is also a box of varied tea bags. 

Rooms are spartan but very nicely laid out. A lot of physical and visual textures on the walls, floors and furniture. Very well laid out rooms, sorta like a hostel/ikea/hipster hotel mashup. Everything you need and packaged very comfortably. 

Tip: When you book, there are special rates found on their website where you can get free breakfast, I would recommend that one. Airport shuttle every 30 minutes.

NOTE: Iron and board are tucked away in a cubbie to the right of the bed if you are facing the bed from the foot.I accidently left my phone charger in my room after I had checked out early that morning.  I called early in the afternoon and asked if they could check my old room for me.  I showed up a few hours later and asked the girl at the front desk.  She knew exactly who I was and gave it to me in a bag!  Very friendly staff.  

Super clean and modern hotel.  The bed was fluffy and comfortable.  Flatcreen tv is directly in front of the bed,  They provide Bliss products.  They include two free bottled water in your room.  There is also a mini Frig!Rosati's was my go to while in Kansas City so i was glad to have one close that delivers. The pan and double dough are my favorite as well as the calzone and a decent salad.We really enjoyed Babbo!  We came on a Tuesday night, which is apparently $5.99 spaghetti and meatballs night, so it was super busy.  We took a seat with no wait on the patio and really enjoyed our experience.  The service was great - friendly, professional and efficient.

The menu was huge...so many great selections to choose from.  The food was great!  I tried the chalkboard menu of grilled chicken topped with tomatoes and feta with grilled veggies on the side and a side salad to start.  I ate every last thing on my plate...it was that good!  I also enjoyed a raspberry vanilla Italian soda...love that they serve these and they do it right!  

We will definitely be back!Cool base, somewhat confusing to drive around.  Lodging is hit or miss.  If you stay, try to stay in the buildings that are south from the office, not north.  I stayed in the older building my first trip here and had black mold in the bathroom and the wifi didn't work.  I asked for the south building the next time and it was great.  Facilities on base are pretty good, however the gym closes pretty early during the weekend.I used to live in the area and order from here often. I love the menu and while it can be a little slow to get your food sometimes the atmosphere is great and staff and chefs are very friendly. The cuts are great and fresh, rolls are neat and beautiful. Everything I've ordered from here has been delicious. Worth stopping in if you love sushi!Friendly employees, and they are the closest shipping place to me that will ship FedEx packages. They have late pick up times (5:30 P.M.) for FedEx, although last time I rushed over to drop off a package before 5:30 the FedEx person had already come by. The employee was nice though, and directed me to the official FedEx station where I could drop it off before 6.This theater has basically been here since the mall first opened in the mid-late 1990s. It was wonderful at first and then it gradually became run down as most places do after a couple decades. I gradually found myself going to other theaters for this reason.

Today was a fluke that my hubs and I ended up here. We received free movie passes and decided to give this newly renovated and upgraded theater a try again when going to see Riddick and wow, the theater is so much neater and streamlined. I love the self automated soda fountains where you can add your own flavors in. I love being able to choose seats while buying tickets so you don't have to worry about finding seats (when it's already pitch dark because you waited too long to drive to the theater and are grateful there are previews. But who procrastinates like that anyway?) 

The automated reclining seats are extremely comfortable!! I almost felt like I was in Scottsdale at iPic, but instead I was right here at an AMC theater on the "west side" of town. It's about time!!Enjoyed Lobby's on a lazy Sunday afternoon. Great service, tastey burger.Authentic and delicious. The food was phenomenal and the service was attentive and quick. My boyfriend had his old stand by, bul go gi, and I had bi him bop (mostly so he could try it so I can broaden his Korean food horizons).. and they were both great. The ban chan (side dishes) were varied and had some authentic items that you don't regularly see in other Korean restaurants in the Valley. What I'm really excited about and can't wait to go back and try is the other menu items such as cha jjang myun (delicious noodles in black bean sauce) and cham pong (spicy seafood noodles)... These are also items rarely seen on a menu outside of k town.Fabulously strong (and well priced) margaritas, served in a no-nonsense, working class, punk/alt rock bar with occasional theme events and live bands, AND it's close enough for me to walk to/stumble home from??    

Yes please!Men! (And Butches!) Finally a vintage shop that understands YOU TOO want to be a DANDY!

The sign for Retro Redux is simply one of the most charming and enticing signs for to a thrift and vintage veteran such as I (16 years), and I finally got to check it out on a day off of Phoenix hopping. First with my friend not afraid of sparkles, we parked easily and entered into a non-smelling and clean space. The furniture is impeccible and I saw a billion couches I wanted to swoon on. But I had a mission-clothes. I entered the space to the right and in the dim light got to work on short sleeved shirts, western, dresses, cardigans, shoes, and some choice jewelry and accessories like belts in the corner. It was a bit cramped due to an over large round rack, but my friend and I alternated b/w "Omg-that is so cute" and "Wait-that is IT? Grab it"-the holy hand clap of awesometown and price was too much to comprehend. In this corner were also some choice mens shirts...hmmm, I do like to dress up Mr. Mustachio....

We wandered past some more concretely-themed "living rooms" and she almost bought a psychedlic peacock pantry tin set for under 20, but needed to check back at home. Then MORE mens clothes! Pants, button downs, sweaters, coats, and so many ties. It dumped out to more womens dresses, button downs, and some nice glass displays of broaches, sunglasses, gloves, etc. There is only one little dressing room with cloth (two may be better), and after a lot of trying on, I ended up with a red/blue checkered shirt western style good for short-armed, small shouldered 5'2 frame at only 16 bucks! In fact, I wore at the bowling event, in KY, at shows...oh man, I have worn this a lot since I bought it. I also got a she-ra style belt with gold detailing over a cream stretchy band-my only other critique would be it didn't end up working out and I wanted to return it/exchange it but noticed on their slip they have a strict sales final policy. Sad. So ten dollars kinda wasted.

BUT-returned again since the boy stated "I kinda want to go shop-" "OK, Lets GO". We had Bunky, Conspire, iBloom for a chocolate soy smoothie to hit and when we got here my 6'3 w/freaky long armed boy had five loads of shirts to try on-there weren't many pants options unless he was short and a little on the heavy side. We ended up with a golden yellow short sleeve shirt that everyone he works with has complimented, a brown plaid western shirt that FITS, and a short-sleeved blue striped shirt, each 16 bucks. He also got a pair of police narc/70s movie star sunglasses for 12 bucks that he loves. He loved this place too since he could help pick up bizarre hostess dresses for me to try on-I didn't end up finding anything, but any good vintage hunter understands it can be feast or famine at a place-although I did almost buy goregous caramel coloured knit gloves that had little bows on them and fit my small fingers...omg, I kinda wanna still get them.

So, for pure shopping pleasure, this place is a treasure to walk around (esp. for that egg chair!) and both people working have been awesome, especially Rachel.Diverse menu, good value and friendly service.

I stumbled upon this place by accident, meant to go to another noodle cafe joint but the yelp search engine led me here, lol. Nevertheless, I was pleasantly surprised. Can't say enough how diverse their menu is. I expected a variety of noodles but they had some great fried rice and pasta as well. They served a small portion of peanuts while we were waiting which was pretty cool. I had the Wonton Noodle and the Yum Tom Goong Fried Rice, which comes with an assortment of fish, veggies and egg strips. While the Wonton was decent, I thought the noodles and broth were just meh. The Wonton dumplings are a little chewy and unusually large. the Tom Goong dish, on the other hand, was great. It has a spicy yet sweet taste, very unique. The value of the dishes are excellent, ranging from $5 tapas to $10 for a regular dish. The service was friendly, food comes out in a few minutes and never had to wait for a refill of water. Excellent place to go during lunch or dessert.I was enticed by the free 10oz after 9pm but I was very satisfied and will return again.  Such a generous offer usually leads to gluttony but I was able to responsibly indulge. 

I tried my own mixture of Cake Batter and Cookies & Cream topped with Peanut M&M's, that more than satisfied my sweet tooth.  

In addition to having great yogurt and toppings it proved to be a fun place to hangout and enjoy your selection.Sustainable cooking in Scottsdale.  

FnB is a real treasure.  

The food, atmosphere and owners are truly exceptional.  If you have not been yet, this place is worth a meal alone, with friends or a special date night.  The location is walkable from the Fashion Square Mall or the W.

Highlights:
The FnB always comes up with unique approaches on simple food with great flavors.  Their meats are especially exceptional and always cooked to a "T" (my mouth is watering just thinking about my last meal here).  A great example of a unique dish was grilled broccoli with a spicy dressing and pine nuts.  The piece of broccoli was the size of a saucer!!  talk about using local produce.

Anyway, if you are looking to change up your dinner routine, want to have some great food that is a little outside the box and have the owners share the passions with you through their food, give FnB a shot.The pros definitely outweigh the cons, but let's start with the cons just because it's more fun.

1. The scary tweakers RIGHT outside. Real entertaining to watch through the windows at first, but I noticed a lot of children in the restaurant staring out there, and heard one say she was scared; so that's no fun for anybody. But, because that has nothing to do with Five Guys as a company, only their scary surroundings, I didn't take away any stars for that. I just wanted to mention it because I'd want someone to mention it to me. :)

2. I took away the star because there is something fundamentally wrong with the french fries. I know there's lots of mixed reviews in the commentary, but I can only speak for myself when I say that I did not enjoy them at all. Neither did my friend who joined me.

But there's lots of pros!

1. Super fast service. I think our food was ready in less than a couple minutes. 

2. Lots of seating. Seating everywhere, I can't even imagine the place ever filling to capacity.

3. The burgers really are the shizzle. I had a bacon cheeseburger, and it was quite delicious. I think the buns are "butter buns" and the burgers are made right there when you order them so they're super fresh.

4. There's a pretty dope coke machine that distributes a plethora of teas, lemonades, sodas, you name it.

Not much else to say... it's a burger joint. :)I like taking out of town visitors here to get something real that isn't from a chain restaurant.  Whenever they come back this is the first place they want to go back to.  I like supporting local businesses like this and will continue to do so.  They just need to be open longer, sometimes I eat dinner late and they are already closed.Aces and Ales is a beer snob's heaven.  I've grown to love the craft beers of America, the IPA's, the darker ales, and the stouts.  Aces and Ales has the finest selection of on tap craft beers than anywhere in Las Vegas, including Yard House, and even my favorite bar, the Draft House.  I've had a few Stone brews, including the 14th Anniversary on tap, a couple of Deschutes brews, and Lagunitas.  A few of these I've had to-go in growler bottles!

I suppose the only complaint that I could muster is that the prices can be a tad bit steep.  Average growlers go for around $40, and beers around the $7 range.  However, these beers are all of the highest quality beers in the US, and perhaps the world.  The range of amazing beer selection is huge with a big chalkboard on the back wall listing all of the day's taps (usually around 20-30 beers).

The local Homebrew Club also hangs out here.  On Fridays (I think every other Friday) some of these guys get together and share beers that they've collected, and chat about beer.  If you want to learn about the world of craft beer, this is the place to be.A girlfriend and I went one Thursday night so that we could also do the Scottsdale Art Walk.  While we were too late for the Art Walk (and further away than I previously realized), I was very happy to discover 5th and Wine.  Great choices of wines by the glass, and perfect food for a girls' night out.Had an hour or so to kill before we headed down the strip for dinner reservations, so we made our way through the sad, smoky casino, which was nearly deserted on Thanksgiving weekend, towards the ass-end of the Monte Carlo. The location of d.Vino is hidden at best (though strategically positioned right across from the theater entrance).

We sat at the bar for a drink and I scanned the menu expecting to find yet another uninspired, sad-sack wine menu put together by some flunkie. Oops, I was wrong. Some pleasant suprises on there, including several more obscure italian reds, and an interesting assortment of beers from the same.  Anyone familiar with Italian beermaking knows that for years the best we've been able to procure in the states is Peroni or Moretti, neither which are worth the cost of shipping it over in the first place.  Imagine my surprise when they  had a good half-dozen microbrews, including a $15-a-bottle chestnut ale.

Well, I love beer and I'm a sucker for chestnuts, so I ordered it (got their last bottle). While we chatted up Brook, the bartender, we realized he was one of the very few that gave half a damn about the propagation and preservation of his craft; we discussed everything from the history of cocktails to the impact of different gins in a mixed drink. 

Our conversation meandered to the usage of bitters, and I lamented the fact that so few bars stock an ingredient necessary to my favorite libation: an Old Fashioned. He, produced a bottle of Fee's Orange Bitters from under the counter with a flourish, "You mean this?" SOLD. Yes, bad idea to mix drinks but finding a barkeep that doesn't screw up an Old Fashioned is a rarity. His was one of the best I've had, ever. 

He also challenged my  wife's assertion that gin drinks taste terrible by whipping up an ominous-sounding cocktail called "Satan's whiskers" and offering to toss it and make something else if she didn't LOVE it. Well, he lost no money on that wager. She's adding it to  her permanent rotation. 

We hadn't the chance to investigate d.Vino's food menu but it looked varied enough. It's on our list to try in the future, even if we won't stay at the hotel next time.I have been to this nail place a few times now. One they have amazingly good deals. Two they do a great job. I can even get in and out on my lunch break, which is always nice! 
They give a great pedicure, manicure and even a eyebrow wax. They even do alterations on clothes there. I have no had anything done there but everytime I am there, their are a lot of people picking up items. 
The places doesnt look like much from the outside but it they do a great job at a unheard of price! 
Thanks Yelpers for helping me to find this gem!Ann and Kim gave my sister and me great service. We were seated quickly, they did a  really nice job with my mani and my sister's gel fill, and they did the work efficiently but without making either of us feel rushed. Bonus points for being open on Sunday. And they don't take reservations, which makes the first-come, first-served nature much more equitable than having to be bumped for a reservation that may or may not show up. A+. We will definitely go back.Grimaldi's in Vegas? Much closer than NY =)

We got half red and half white with italian sausage and mushrooms. Love the thin crust! My favorite was the white pizza because the garlic really brought out the flavors. The italian sausage reminded me more of mini meatballs than actual sausage. 

Just a note, the "Personal" pizza is quite large. It's actually six decent sized slices from the usual 4 mini slices that I've seen at other pizza joints. It made a good light lunch for two. 

This isn't one of those cheap $2 a slice pizza joints. Come here for a good NY style pizza. Can't wait to come back and try something else.Fantastic family hotel at a great price! I love that a full breakfast is included. Kids loved the waffle maker. The staff at this hotel have been extra-friendly. They even called my room after check-in to make sure we were happy. Nice touch. 
Fun indoor kids pool - we played in here for hours and loved it. Highly recommended family hotel.Very strange to review a store like this.  Seems obvious - you go in, you buy stuff, you leave.  Pretty simple.  I've been there many, many times.  And I must say, EACH time I'm there, the employees are very helpful and friendly.  I tip my hat to Costco for taking care of their employees - I know they pay more than the average store, give good benefits, etc.   And still, somehow, they make money.  Sounds like a win-win-win for all of us.  We need more of that in this world.

I REALLY love the fruit here.  I have no idea how they do it, but they get the "good stuff".  Their raspberries, while being super cheap, are also the biggest and best berries you can get.  Each berry is better than the junk I get in town for twice the price.  The strawberries are consistently good as well.

On weekends, you can have lunch just by cruising the sample stations.  Oh, and those stations work - I often end up buyin' what they're sellin'!  The kiddos also like to try stuff there (yay).

Need a quick lunch?  For around $2 you can get a slice of pizza and a soda (with refill).  Boom!

The Costco gas station used to be a deal on gas, but has since come even with all the other places around them.  Not sure why, but no special reason to stop there anymore (unless you have the executive membership and get cash back).

I won't go to Sam's.  I WILL go to Costco.Salsa is really good, especially if you like it hot. Normally restaurants tone down the hot salsa but not here. Food itself is pretty good, we tried the burritos. Atmosphere is authentic. Service is average, friendly.We went to Bosa Donuts for a little treat around 9:40 pm and the place was empty. There were still donuts available but they didn't even make maple long johns that day! I thought that was a standard? The donuts we did get were pretty yummy! Favorite part was the outdoor seating and summer time chillin with a donut at 10 pm!They have a variety of foods. Always nice to go out for Chili's if you don't know what your in the mood for.You HAVE to go see Brittany Rea at 20 Lounge! She is my go-to girl for fab nails. It is such a cute boutique-esque salon with a chic mani bar, and comfy pedicure thrones. They also offer complimentary champagne during your services! Mama loves her bubbly, but I usually opt for the yummy passion fruit iced tea that Wildflower Bread Co. has next door :)

My first service here was a gold rockstar gel mani, which was "so so." The tech was sweet, precise, and fabulous, but it just wasn't as SPARKLY as glitter gels that I've had at other places! I was happy to get 20% off of my service for being a new customer.

Last week I made an appointment with Brittany and got the new Shellac polish! I am officially obsessed... I got "Romantique" which is a super light pink/tan looking color & it looks GORGEOUS! I was a bit apprehensive to see how it would hold up, because it's not as thick as gel polish so I thought it might chip, but it still looks fresh after 7+ days! Love, love, love it. I will definitely be back!Don't judge a man by the types of businesses he frequents. Judge a man by his cleanliness and his grooming habits. 

Today, I felt gross, so I decided to go and get my hands cleaned up. I went and got a MANicure. I was in the area, and needed a good place, so I hopped on my iPhone and got onto Yelp (shoutout to one of my favorite apps) and found this local spot.

As soon as I walked in, I was greeted by a very friendly person. Then I was prompty seated at the nail bar, where I bet Brittany (sp?) who was my esthetician for the afternoon. Totally a cool chick. Very friendly. Pretty cute too. 

They have TV's in the background...they had on a Jason Mraz concert, then some cool Weezer music videos. Awesome sauce. Extra awesome.

Brittany made for some fun conversation and it wasn't awkward shootin the breeze with someone I had never met before. Maybe it's because I rock like that. 

She made sure to take care of my horrible hands with great detail and care. The instruments she used were clearly sanitized and baked in the sanitizing oven like at the dentist's office. We both put on high grade hand sanitizer before she went to work. 

I was also treated to a paraffin treatment and a very handsome hand massage. Very relaxing. 

I was treated with a classy glass of cucumber water in a fancy wine glass. I felt special. Probably because I am.

After tip, I spent $30 for my MANicure. A little more than I would spend than going to the usual Korean or Vietnamese place, but it's definitely worth the money. You are treated like a lord here. 

I'm definitely coming back.

Oh yeah...they wax too! I wish I had known this beforehand. 

Peace.Came here for the first time last weekend.  Funny how I found out about this place from out of town friends.  

Food is varied.  I took three trips to the buffet and every time, there is new dish being served.   Most dishes are good, reminds you of your mom's or aunt's cooking.  Pancit malabon and kare-kare are my favorites.  Some are just ok.

Wish they served leche flan for dessert.  But for about $10, soda included, this buffet was worth it.I like Harkins.  The seats are comfortable.  I kinda wish the screen was bigger.  And something about the surround sound just doesn't seem right, but I can't put my finger on it.  But it's still better than any other theater in this area.  Each row of seats is enough higher than the one in front that it would take a VERY tall person to block the view of another patron.  In some theaters that is not true.

Overall, a nice theater.

One thing I will slam them for is their ticket price.  $9.50?  Really?  I know they all are this expensive now, which is why we don't go to the theater much.  For three of us (two adults, one student) it's $26.  I can buy the DVD for that (BluRay!) and watch it as much as I want.  But when we get passes at the office, for example, we do like this theater.11.13.2012 Herbs and Rye (Las Vegas, NV)

Herbs and Rye is located on the corner or South Valley View and Sahara. Every time drove past this restaurant the parking lot was always full (around dinner time). That is always a good thing! When we walked up to the building a little after 6pm, the black exterior and windowless building had a speakeasy feel to it. Opening the doors, it definitely reminded me of an older, classy, speakeasy type of restaurant. There are two dinning areas. We were lead into the area which also holds the bar. The bar is 3/4 the length of the building. Opposite the bar are booths. Chandeliers hang from the ceiling, dimly lighting the restaurant. While you wait for your dinner to be served they provide you with fresh baked bread and butter. We were lucky enough on out first visit to make happy hour. Which not only meant discounts on liquor it also meant 50% off our steaks. They identify which items can be discounted because of happy hour with a star next to the item. We ordered steaks and they each came with one side dish. In addition we ordered an additional side dish... we needed to try it all! The side dishes are served family style. Our meal was excellent as well as the service. Throughout our meal I noticed that the bar was continuously becoming busier. We left a little before 8pm and the place was still quit busy. I feel like I was the last to know about this lovely whole in the wall restaurant. They are always the best! There is not doubt that we will be going back.

 
Impressed!Yes, the Aria in the new City Center is a very chic, very European, and very out-of-my-league-so-don't-bother-trying kind of place. So I would expect nothing but a tres-chic ice cream parlor in a hotel as fancy-schmancy as the Aria. With its perpetual video showing on the outside wall to draw you in, Sweet Chill is just that type of place in all its muted day-glo rainbow glory. Its clean, pinkish and slightly retro-look is meant to evoke an earlier time when people enjoyed sitting on plastic, butt-contoured chairs (see photos). It's as if Paris Hilton opened her own gelateria, bitches.

They serve sandwiches and salads, but the eye candy is really the variety of ice cream flavors to be seen in their long glass display case. Prices are not surprisingly on the high side with a large cup a whopping seven bucks. Jamie W. and I shared a small cup of peanut butter gelato for the comparative bargain of $4.75 (see photo). I say bargain because you do get three small scoops which you can lick slowly to take in all the colors of the seats in the place. Eventually, the cacophony of pan-EuroAsian voices does make your ears bleed - and you have no choice but to leave and go back to your $80-a-night hotel way, way down the Strip.

ICE CREAM - 4 stars...judging from the peanut butter, very creamy and tasty if a tad pricey
AMBIANCE - 4 stars...chic while you lick with abandon
SERVICE - 3.5 stars...a bit non-descript...it is a new place
TOTAL - 4 stars...stop for your sweet tooth and then do fifty laps in the Aria pool around the cornerI'll give the cupcake I ordered a 4 out of 5, but the service a 3 out of 5. There were maybe 3 people ahead of me and I swear I waited 20 minutes. Got to the point where I considered leaving because it was so slow. When it finally came to be my turn, the girl behind the counter was nice, but it just took forever to actually get to her. She let me sample their Red Velvet cupcake because it is usually my favorite. I wasn't impressed at all with their Red Velvet, so I opted for the Carrot Cake cupcake and I'm glad I did. It was so much better: moist and rich. I guess I have to recommend checking this place out, but beware you are going to wait.What a great discovery!  Luu's Chicken Bowl is a current favorite for our family.  We had driven by the location several times without even noticing it was there, but I could not be more happy we stumbled across it. 

For those of you who don't like to read a page long review, here are some of the things I love most about Luu's....

Homemade, amazingly delicious sauces
Fresh, high quality ingredients
Fast, friendly service
Great prices and generous servings
They have a drive through 
These guys know how to pack a to-go sack!
...and last but not least.......the CRAB WONTONS!

Oh, you want to know more?  Well, let me elaborate a bit :)

Upon entering Luu's, I always know I will be greeted by a smiling friendly face and an immaculately clean dining area.  There is a white board near the register listing the daily specials (try the teriyaki chicken and yakisoba) and a small counter housing homemade condiments, plastic utensils and a soda fountain.  After I place my order, I always hear a fresh batch of wontons get dropped in the fryer as they prepare our chicken bowls.  After just a few minutes, my order is on the counter perfectly parceled with everything I could need; extra teriyaki sauce, hot sauce, sweet and sour, and if we get a ginger chicken bowl (another must try item) there is also extra ginger sauce.  There are napkins and utensils included in the bag, as well.

If you decide to go through the drive through, keep in mind that they fry the wontons and egg rolls to order so there will be a few minutes of waiting at the window if you order these items.

The crab wontons are the crabbiest I have had.  Ever. They are delish with a double dip into the sweet and sour and then the hot sauce.  Trust me, it will be the best $2.59 +tax you have spent in a long time


**For a nominal fee you can substitute white meat chicken and/or brown rice, both of which I highly recommendLeaving four stars because I'm not really a fan of obnoxious bachelorette people that were here when I visited. The parking's kinda hard when it's packed but it's a must visit when you are in townThe Culinary Dropout has been open 3 weeks now. I give it a 4.5.  Not 5... read to the end to find out why.
 
  I went for lunch yesterday with a friend to check it out.  I LOVED it!  First, I must admit that because it was a beautiful day in Scottsdale my mood was happy to start with.  As we stood outside the front door admiring the patio and deciding if we wanted to go in or not, a very sweet young lady left her hostess stand inside to come out and greet us.  I like this.  She could have waited for us to come to her.  This tells me the restaurant wants business and has trained their employees well!

Right away you notice the atmosphere.  Hip and elegant with a touch of years past... hence the magnificent chandeliers that draw your eye up.  The seating has a look of baroque meets modern.  Well designed, plenty of space... you don't feel crammed into the other people around you.

We of course chose to sit outside because of the beauty of the day.
It took no time at all for a very sweet and adorable waitress to greet us, get our drink orders and give us a few explanations of the house specialty, the Anti-pasta bar.  Before I get into that though... I must recommend a Pisco Sour.  Not many restaurants offer them or even know what they are...definably one of my fav's and believe me... I make them well.

The Anti-pasta bar is designed to let you pick and choose for either an  entree or an app from a wonderful choice of excellent cheeses, salumi's ( that's right... NOT salami... true lovers know the difference.)
olives, marconi almonds and so much more.  Your choices are then beautifully laid out on a  plate after being hand sliced at the bar where you are encouraged to watch the artistry.

On to lunch... I chose a wonderful Smoked Chicken Salad.  They smoke their chicken right there on the sight and I have to say... it was fantastic!!  The pears that had been sweetened, the endive and the pistachios that accompanied the salad to be tossed in a fantastic vinaigrette. It was sublime!  Our meal was finished off with their famous monkey bread that came with a beautiful scoop of ice-cream.

Yes, all the way around I loved this place.  The only reason I haven't given 5 stars is because I will go back and rate the bar.  This is typically the heart of an establishment and will have a lot to do to determine return customers.  Look for my review on this.

Happy eating everyone!!Cornbread, crispy fried chicken and a waffle..mmmm..mmmm!!
I've friends that rage about that other place in south phoenix, and would be glad to visit, but i came across this place while doing some shopping with a friend. It's located where one of my favorite greasy spoons used to be, but sadly they closed. The place was in desperate need of a makeover, and it got it! bright and clean when I was in a couple months ago, and the owners were cheerfully at work in the kitchen. They'd been open for awhile and are not new to the phoenix restaurant scene. If you're looking for Soul Food in the north-central valley, give this place a shot!Sugar Daddy Cupcake might just be my go-to for cupcakes in Phoenix.  Normally I'm a Euro-buttercream or bust kind of guy, but the frosting here is a really satisfying balance between sweetness and creaminess.  Most days it'd be a touch too sweet for my tastes, but on nights like last night -- nights when I'm craving a bit of sugar -- these will do quite nicely.  

The first thing I noticed was how cute the interior was.  Bright pink, very cheery -- like being inside a strawberry Starburst.  My friends and I arrived just a few minutes before closing, and so for about a minute we didn't see anyone at the register.  Then an employee popped out, apologizing profusely about making us wait too long, even though we hadn't even decided which cupcakes we wanted yet.  I ended up going with the s'more, Cory's Fox 10 Fantasy, the Pink Cadillac (thank you Yelp!), and the triple chocolate.  Four cupcakes for $12 = $3.00 a cupcake.  That might seem like a bit much, but these babies are larger than your average cupcake.  Definitely worth the price in my book.

A couple of my friends got the red velvet, and after trying a piece I immediately regretted not ordering one of those.  The cake was as perfect as I could ask for.  Moist, delicate, smooth -- truly lives up the the latter part of its name.  The cream cheese frosting was really nice, too.  I love it when they deliver a touch more strongly on the cream cheese flavor than they do on sugar, and that was the case here.

Cory's Fox 10 Fantasy was basically a chocolate chip cookie remixed into a cupcake.  Everything about it except the actual cookie on it was good.  The s'more cupcake -- also tasty.  The graham cracker layer on the bottom was an unexpected surprise.  The Pink Cadillac -- wow.  It's not necessarily inventive (strawberry buttercream, strawberry cake, vanilla buttercream filling), but it stands as a wonderful reminder that traditional -- when executed well -- is anything but boring.

This place is somewhere between a 4 and a 5 for me, but I'm rounding down only because they don't use the top tier ingredients that I crave.  They're doing everything right, but a few premium components would make them even better.  Throw in some high-fat European butter and some Valrhona chocolate into the mix, and this could potentially become my favorite cupcake place, period.  For now, though, it'll just be my sinful escape every time I'm in the Phoenix area.Great beer selection. Food isn't amazing but surprisingly good for a microbrewery. I'd definitely recommend this place.PH god some of the best suites ever. Awesome view of vegas and very clean bathrooms and awesome decor in there. I need to stay here, it is the place to be. 

very spacious, bullout sofa be. huge kind size bed. damn...This is a great boutique in a great area! I walked to Paradise Bakery after dropping an undisclosed amount of money in this shop! The store is clean and well arranged. I got a lot of outfit ideas from the owner who was very knowledgeable about fashion and trends. She was friendly and complimentary. There were some pricey high end items like Rock Revival, True Religion and then more affordable pieces to compliment. Also nice accessories. I picked up a very unique necklace which my hot Fed Ex guy loves! That's worth the price right there as a good ice breaker ladies! wink wink I got on the email list and also got a follow up call telling me that I had left my sunglasses, ooops! and thanking me for stoppping in. You may have to save up to put together a full outfit or two, but I would definitely recommend if you are ever in the area!I went here at about 11:15 today for lunch. There was a line. that had already formed. Its a very small venue, no bathroom, so make sure to wash your hands and do your business before you get there. Only about a dozen or so tables on the floor, and the cashier is also your waitress delivering food to your table. If your expecting great service, forget about it, you focus strictly on the food here. Their is barely any parking. Everyone that seemed to come in was new to this place checking out other patrons food and asking them what it is and how they like it. Im sure they were all fellow yelpers as well considering where this place is and how everyone appeared to be new to this place.

The address is a little confusing with the map being shown on their website. Its off 16th street as the address implies, and the crossroad is Palm and 16th. There is a sign for another business there that says FAT PAD which is easily visible. Blink and you will miss this restaurant. The inside has a lot of cool mexican art. They also have a fresh salsa bar.

Wow this has some very flavorful food. Its not greasy or fatty at all. You can really taste all the ingrediants. I ordered the Dog Fish Tacos, the mahi mahi burrito, and the Carne Asada Taco. Everything was absolutely delish with lots of flavor! I liked the Dog Fish taco best. 

Make sure to get there before noon. They do take a while to make it, so be sure you have the time, especially if they are busy. You can call ahead or fax your order in as well.Just had lunch there and as for being a major taco fan i have had better(Los Angeles Tacos still rule) , but overall its pretty good compare to other places near by. I had the Argentine Style which thats were my dad is from.. was not as great the meat needed seasoning and the chimichuri was bland , not to mention a little cheap on putting the sauce on , so i had to ask for more. But the one that got me was the shark tacos , now thats a taco ! Just wish the would recomend the sauces/ salsa to put on it that would help bring out more flavor. They have so many salsas I WANTED TO TRY ALL OF THEM !  Great place for a good lunch and awsome concept ! if you have'nt tried it , you must go once its a fine meal for $10. Happy hour prices seem to be reasonable also. I will be back again i must say and will ask more questions about the sauces.I come here for the famous Bobbie. It's thanksgiving in a sandwich. The best part is that it's available all year round and you don't have to slave in the kitchen for hours.  When i'm craving a hot sandwich the cheese steak with mushrooms, onions, and peppers has never disappointed me. Just today I decided to switch it up and got the chicken cheese steak and  I didn't regret my choice.

This location is across the street from my apartment. I can make it there and back in my apartment in 15 minutes enjoying my sandwich. So needless to say I have been to this location many times. 

Friendly, courteous, clean and speedy staff. What more can you ask for in your neighborhood sandwich shop. 

There was this one occasion though that they were so speedy when I got home and opened up that butcher paper I found a Bobbie massacre. The cranberry sauce ratio to sandwich was ridiculous it was a red mess. I have since forgiven them and have been back. But watch your consistency and we'll have a long and happy relationship.My second time coming to Hash House I tried the location at Imperial Palace. I tried the French Toast...oh my goodness the best I have ever had! They are topped with banana cinnamon cream w/ pecan maple syrup! 

My first visit to HH I tried the Sage Fried Chicken and waffles and it was ok, but the french toast is much better!! 

The portions are very large so it is a good idea to share :)Holy gigantic portions of food batman!

My friend recommended this place so even though I am on expense account and can get away with the 50 buck dinner places I thought I'd give this a try.  

I ordered one of the nightly specials, the 'lamb chop hash'.  First, the server brought a giant honey covered biscuit with a side of butter.  You have to eat this with a fork and you really don't need the butter.  The biscuit would have been a tad dry if not for the honey, but it worked and I ate most of it.  Which was probably a mistake, because soon after a gigantic skillet with enough food for three people arrived.  In this skillet was a generous serving of delicious, fluffy scrambled eggs that did not taste like they were over milked but were fluffy on their own, some delicious garlicky green beans, some cooked carrot slices, sliced red and orange bell pepper, a metric buttload of roasted potato chunks and four lamb chops. With a sprig of rosemary.    Holy guacamole*!  (*there was no guacamole)

I sort of made a dent - I ate all the lamb chops (great), all the green beans (great), all the eggs (great), a good amount of the peppers, a few of the carrots and a couple bites of potato.

Ironically enough the potatoes were the weakest part.  I'd like them cut smaller and crispier.  But heck, everything else was good and there was WAY too much food.

This dinner was $18.99+tax.  A very, very good deal for the strip and it tasted pretty good too.  Honestly I'd prefer a smaller portion since I hate wasting food and most people on the strip won't have a way to deal with leftovers.  But, if you come with a companion who likes to eat the same food, you could easily share one of these if you asked for an extra plate.First of all, THANK YOU to the person on here who gave the tip about sitting at the bar. We didn't have to wait at all so that as great! We enjoyed our breakfasts, I had eggs, bacon and a huge pancake, hubby had an enormous ham and cheese omelet. The only bummer was that they were out of the tea I wanted so I ordered coffee then found out they don't have non-dairy creamer, boo, what about lactose intolerant people? It was pricey ($40 for 2 of us for breakfast) but I would go back.Hidden gem in a business area where few good restaurants exist. The Jordanian owners are always very nice and friendly. I love both vegetarian platters (mostly because I appreciate the variety of falafel, baba, hummus, and/or spanakopita), but when in a carnivorous mood, the basic gyro platter is also yummy, though nothing out of the ordinary. The grocery part of the store is fantastic if you're a foodie like me, always intrigued by items not found in the megamart. Affordable Mediterranean staples, like tahini, and decent produce prices too (though quality/availability is hit or miss). 

Cons: Tabbouli could have more flavor (more lemon, less bulgar, maybe?), service can be slow if you are in a hurry during lunch. 

Overall, worth a trip if you're in the mood for something more authentic in this area of suburban, crappy chain restaurants.We were hading to the Orleans showroom to see Bill Mahr. We could not decide where to have dinner before the show. At the last minute made reservations for Canal Street. We made a good choice. I had not been here in years. It is a quiet charming place. I like the booths and the decor. 
They have a new menu and the choices were limited but sounded delicious. 
We skipped appetizers, enjoyed the bread and oil and balsamic. I ordered the filet mignon with Bearnaise sauce. It came with either soup or salad. I chose the salad and it was fresh and great tasting. And I am not a salad fan. My filet was like butter. So tender so tasty. The Bearnaise sauce was great. A little thicker than Mortans but I thoroughly enjoyed it. My BF had shrimp with pasta and the minestrone soup. He loved it. 
Our waiter was great. Working so many tables but still paid great attention to us and all the other diners in his station. 
I will go back here.Great shorts and other stuff that get very colorful when worn out in the sun!  These stores are in various cities, especially in touristy areas.  Look for the bargains on the clearance rack too.   They are sometimes as low as $10!Just recently moved to a new house so I've been here lots of times to buy some "home improvements" products. Most Lowes are similar in size and stocked with the same items so nothing to share in regards to that.

Let's talk service... Skip was charming and very helpful! First visit, he assisted us on making an appointment to get our windows measured for some blinds. He informed us on an upcoming promotion on a specific brand we were gearing towards. He also offered an additional 10% military discount on top of that. He just looked at my BF and asked if he was in the service (must be the haircut). But I like that he took the initiative to ask because we wouldn't have even thought of that.

Second visit, I went down by myself to pick out blinds. He also educated me the different types from color to materials, etc. He also suggested shades which I knew nothing about to. I'm a very indecisive person and was also trying to stay within budget. He was very patient and took the time to price out different options for me so that I would walk out of there satisfied. I think I spent about an hour there when he said it normally took people 20 minutes. LOL.

Besides Skip, the other employees have been helpful, too. Everytime I've walked by one, they've asked if I needed help to find what I was looking for.Shaving with razors and changing car tires
Shooting with hand guns and building camp fires
Changing old light bulbs and light fittings
These are a few of those manlier things.

Even to the tune of sound of music, there are few things in life more manly than smoking a good cigar.

The building itself leaves something to be desired, and it's 'not quite' up to a Smoking Jackets required level, but the staff more than makes up for it. Cigar Inn is owned and operated by an extremely nice family of cigar aficionado's. Their daughter behind the counter will put most guys to shame with her mastery of tobacco, but without making you feel like less of a man when doing so. She asked me what I was looking for and I told her I'd like to have something not extremely bold, and easy to smoke. She suggested an Ashton (brand) cigar, which was perfect. 

I'll more than likely be back from time to time, I'm looking forward to my next visit!

Happy Yelping Phoenix, go chop some wood, drink a single malt scotch, then come to Cigar Inn.Always happy to see you, cashiers are very nice and place is very clean. Great daily specials, I always wait for taco Tuesdays. Can't beat it.Friendly, fast and very yummy! They make their bagels from scratch and they are very good.  Its a great place to stop in and grab a fast breakfast.  The nova lox bagel and breakfast bagel with egg and ham are our favs!!Happy with my pedicure. Also came with my wife, daughter and granddaughter, and we were all pleased with both the service and the quality of work.
That didn't seem to be the case for another of the patrons there at the same time. She was quite vociferous with her complaints.NY style pie on the in the West Valley

More of a Chicago-style pizza family, but we like NYPD Pizza.  Setting is an open, loud restaurant.  Ordering is quick, drinks arrive quickly, and the service is upbeat.  Pizza is actually very good-- too often, NY-style places are super oily and lack interesting flavor.  These folks don't commit those sins and you can taste your toppings.

Very good for groups.  Price is a tad high for pizza compared to the big chains.  All prices are going up these day though, and this is much better than a Pizza Hut, Domino's, or Pappa John's.Always keep in mind that "thrifting" isn't the same as retail shopping. If you want nice n fancy, don't thrift. You wanna find a good deal or two, then go here.

As thrift stores go, this one is well organized. Staff was willing to help. Prices were reasonable. I've been to other Goodwill stores who's prices were higher. 

I needed something to wear to a party and I walked out with two $10 dresses. Two dresses for $20?! I'm happy with that!

My only complaint is that the bathroom needed attention. 

I'll be back here again!I'd say this place is good, they try to do well each day. The only thing is that when I order my ice coffee and nothing else, I end up waiting a little too long to get my coffee. I understand they give orders in chronologically but having to wait only for a drink and no food. I feel that I can get my drink quicker. Get the ones who only have a beverage out and on their way. You will a lot more happier customers that much more. Keep up your smiles, that are welcoming. Thank youI normally wouldn't review a fast-food chain such as Panda, but the quality of the food (yes, for "fast food") and the service was so good at this location that I couldn't resist.  Panda Express is, of course, express Chinese food & "it is what it is" for that.  And what it is, generally, is quite satiating when you're craving Orange Chicken or Beef & Broccoli, etc.  
The staff at this location were extremely friendly - everyone (even cooks in the back) said a happy (not forced) hello!  We stopped here later in the evening, so many of the trays were 1/2 full or less.  This didn't bother me at all, but the server asked if we wanted freshly made entrees, even for the ones still 1/2 full.  We didn't need it, but it was still quite nice to be asked so politely (on the contrary, I didn't get my entree of choice at another Panda Express location because the tray was 1/4 full and only contained remaining vegetables and no meat from the dish...the server did not ask if I wanted it freshly made).  
***Keep the receipt: you will get a free entree with the purchase of a 2-entree meal if you simply call in for a survey or complete it online.  You'll receive a code for your next visit & the cashier will deduct the price of an entree.  That's a $4 value for less than 5 minutes of time!I had taken him to this vet clinic before, and had had a frustrating experience (the vet kept telling me that my very calm cat was stressed out). 

This same cat was having some issues with sneezing and coughing, so we had to take him to the vet again. We ended up with a different vet and a different tech. This tech took the time to keep our cat calm (even during the thermometer), and made sure that I was aware of the full process for my cat's treatment. The vet was very nice, and listened to everything that I said. 

The clinic was able to give my cat an antibiotics shot so I wouldn't have to give it to him orally, and the clinic provided me with support on how to give my cat the anti-virals without him spitting.  All of this was relatively cheap- only $140 total! 

Two days after the appointment the vet actually called me to see how the sick cat and the healthy cats at home were doing! I've never had a vet take that kind of time for me/my pets.

They can be kind of pushy about services (cleaning cat's teeth, etc...), but overall, I think that they understand that sometimes there just isn't the money for it.I love the convenience of panda express and although we have not been happy at other panda expresses, everything we got here was delicious!What makes a coffee shop special?  Why the people you are with of course!  While awaiting a movie on our family movie day, we stopped in to Tully's to get some hot chocolate.  

The hot chocolate was good, but I can honestly say I have had better.  It was almost like it needed more flavor given the volume of liquid.  It was still nice and hot, and provided a nice break on what turned out to be a very chilly Arizona day which is unusual in itself.  

We will probably try it again, and hope for even better!Absolutely beautiful casino hotel!  Everything was very hip and high end and fun.  The Chandelier Bar was amazing - you really feel like you're in the middle of a chandelier.  Great atmosphere, tasty drinks, waitresses in skimpy clothes - what more could you want in a Vegas casino bar?  Only issue: a few of my friends are cigar smokers and could only do so on level one.

The rooms are amazing.  My friend and I had a 2-queen room that was decorated beautifully and had a great view of the Bellagio fountains.  On a Thursday we were able to check in early at around 11AM no problem.  however a friend was staying in one of the more popular 1-bedroom suite rooms and that one didn't offer any early check in.  The suite was to die for beautiful though.  Private terrace patio, a deep soaking tub with a terrific window view.  It even had a dishwasher (not sure if that's standard or not).  My only complaint about the rooms is that they had a coffee machine, but you had to pay for the coffee from the minibar.

Ate lunch at Holstein's - great burgers and milkshakes (I had a burger called the Longhorn that had BBQ brisket on top of it - amazing!).   Had a yummy brunch at Henry's - the Cinnamon Roll French Toast was to die for!

The only reason I'm giving the Cosmo 4 stars instead of 5 is that gambling was definitely more expensive here than at other casinos (we went to Bellagio and Planet Hollywood to gamble).  Table minimums were mostly $25 and up, with tons of tables even higher - $50 and up.  But if you're a high roller or a non-gambler, that won't be a problem.  Overall, I think this is a fabulous place to stay and to hang out.Conflicted. Had a really good time gambling, mostly all craps. Craps dealers were awesome (shout out to John / Johnny from Philly - cool cat). But damn , the clientele was suspect at times. Weird. 

Overall a fun place to play craps. $10 and $15 tables which was nice if your getting your balls handed to you on the $25 tables.Love the things I find here.

You def can shop here for anything on a budget.

I can make you a cake, progresso dinner, decorate your place for a party, read a book and give you your birthday card all from this place.

One stop, all for your needs things. Most are great find but others are cheap, break easily. 

On the positive I've found things I love here that are great snacks for my toddler who seems to always be hungry.

Off the top of my head I will mention stuff;
Books, cards, t.p, plates, silverware, frozen foods, soups, toys, Christmas stocking stuffers, candy galore, drinks, sunglasses, wipes, hair supplies, tools, locks, gift bags for every occasion, cleaning supplies, etc etc. boom! I know... I blew your mindReally nice rooms, friendly service. Far off the strip so no bother and no noise.
Stayed there 1 night on a stop over. well worth the drive out for a quite time.Timbers is still one of my local bar food favs..You can always get good BBQ wings or grilled cheese to settle that urge for bar food. Try the Hot BBQ wings with blue chees is deelish!!Very friendly, professional and timely service. I was told I'd be seen at 9 o'clock and they whisked me back to the MRI tube at precisely 9. My technician was very friendly and helpful.I am returning customer here,  and the atmosphere feels relaxing.  The owner greets you as soon as you walk in and offers water with fruit! It's the little things that keep me coming back here !!This was our first visit at Eddie D's.  Owner Ed and Shirley personally  greeted us and explained the entire menu.  Ed brought us over samples of meatballs, sliced beef, macaroni salad, cole slaw, potato salad and cream puffs for dessert.

I ordered the Shirley special which was a chicken breast with sweet peppers, a side of spaghetti with marinara, garlic bread and a cannoli for dessert.  The rest of our table had various sandwiches.  Everyone's meal was delicious and extremely affordable.  This is must try.  A+++++This is a place I can't stay away from for some reason. Nail places are at every corner & blocks near everyone's house. However like I said, I choose this place over the closest or cheapest one near me. It pricier compared to the usual, but my nails always last so long afterwards. They offer you water/soda & always try to converse. Theres a new spa added to the company next door too. It gets pretty busy so sometimes you may need an appointment. Everything's nice here & you'll get what you pay for!This is a normal Starbuck's outlet.  It does not have a drive through which makes it somewhat quaint. The pace is a bit laid back because you have to park and actually walk inside.

I have always found the staff to be pleasant and efficient.This place is amazing!!! Love dine in at the bar area, cocktails and food are delicious, tuna tostada is a must!!!!I love this shop! A small and cute little boutique that resides in one of the plaza's off of Eastern. I can't always afford highly branded names, and sometimes I think it's such an effort to have to go to the mall. Thankfully, this place has it all! Trendy clothing, awesome selection of boots, sandals, and club shoes, as well as a variety of accessories. I think even during Halloween they promoted these really cute masquerade masks as well.

Everything you'll see in this store is organized by color, which makes things organized and efficient. It's very easy to navigate through their shop because we all usually start with color when it comes to preference. 

Everything there is trendy and affordable. Prices on tops can range from $4 and up (yes! $4 and up!) and jeans can run from $10 and up (yes! $10 and up!). 

Only downside is that they don't do returns and only do exchanges and store credit. Also, OBVIOUSLY if things are too affordable to be true then there must be a catch. The clothing is of poor quality so you must be careful when washing or wearing your outfils. The threading starts to come off fairly quickly. Especially after a few washes, and some of the material are subjected to shrink after washing. So if you REALLY know what your doing, you'll find a nice snag worth buying.The views from the patio are amazing! We came here for brunch and the food was great! I especially loved the bread basket! Service was great with no complaints!We were looking for a casual dinner spot for our first night in Las Vegas. The menu at Wolfgang Puck Pizzeria and Cucina appealed to everyone in our party. The food did not disappoint. I had the caramelized onion, guanciale, and goat cheese pizza. The crust was light and chewy, the toppings were delicious. Husband was very happy with his Italian meat pizza. Other entrees enjoyed were the eggplant parmesan and linguine with steamed clams. Service was excellent. And the people watching opportunities were fantastic.Really happy there is a Mexican restaurant on the Strip that actually has vegan options.

So my fianc√© and I went here after looking at countless reviews for vegan restaurants.  The abidance is rather chill (great for a big group since it looks like a bar-type of restaurant).  

My fianc√© ordered the vegan fajitas with the fake chicken and I ordered the vegan tacos with cabbage and avocado.  I am not a huge fan of fake meats but my fianc√© LOVES it and was really happy with his order. I tried the veggies from his fajitas and the flavoring was VERY GOOD.  Mine, however, was a bit too lemony.  I ended up finishing it but compared to the flavor of my fianc√©'s dish, I was a bit disappointed.  Next time we go here, I will order the fajitas with just veggies.  

Overall, though, the service was very good and we were happy to have found a hidden restaurant with some cool vegan options.  :)Amber our server was excellent. Huge smile and very attentive.

My girl and I tried the Calamari, slow cooked meatballs, rigatoni and the chicken parmigiana.

Calamari - tasted light but oily.
Meatballs - Big and full of flavor.
Rigatoni - Just Ok.
Parmigiana - Huge portion & good.

Will I return... No. With so many options, I think I would rather take my money somewhere else.

If you have a TropPlus Card you save a $1 on items. I think the prices are pricier then what most Italian places charge.

I for one wanted to try it for myself, was full yes, was happy with service... Yes.

Will I return, No!Okay i am really really close to giving this place 5 stars. 

The staff was very friendly when we walked in. We were met with a smile and promptly seated where we can watch them make our crepes (via tv). The whole decor of the place was like being in the alps. I loved the whole look and feel of the place. Nothing was out of the ordinary at all, they definitely knew what they wanted when building/designing it. 

I did not go here for the dessert or the fondue (but we want to come back and try just that, and if thats good then it will def move up to 5 stars). We both had savory crepes, which btw were delicious. It is a little pricey but the portion sizes are large here so nothing too much to worry about. 

I got the Fermiere (sp?) savory crepe, it was chicken, sauteed onions, swiss cheese, and cream of mushroom. Wow this was really great, first off read the ingredients of course its going to be delicious. The cheese is "freshly" imported from switzerland (i think thats where the server said).  The cheese was full and flavorful. I loved the crepe very much, great complimenting flavors. The other dish we got was the Mont St. Michel, which is salmon, lemon, dill sauce, lettuce and tomatoes. This was a cold served crepe and was equally as delicious as my fermiere. What i really liked about this place was the proteins in the plate. You can simply taste the quality and freshness of each. The salmon was perfectly smoked, not over powering and still moist and not discolored. The chicken was obviously grilled chicken breast, you could taste the char from the grill on the chicken which i think is AWESOME!

To wrap it up i left content with what i had to eat...

the neighboring table had a meat dish which was cooked with burning burboun (i think it was burboun). i forget the name but the waitress said it was their "signature dish" so it must be good...smelled amazing..also on my list of things to try as i WILL be back here to try again.Love their burgers! The egg bun is delish and hamburger meat is fresh and tasty.  I loved the smash fries before they changed it to the skinny shoe string fries, hence the 1 star deduction.  Make sure to get a milk shake to wash down your meal.  My fav is the caramel vanilla shake, yum!Really tastey pizza from nice folks although pricey for take & bakeThis truck is always at UNLV, which is convenient for me. I come here for their Caprese sliders. Delish. It goes a little like this: Bun, mozzarella, balsamic, basil, tomato, eggplant, heel. The only thing that I don't enjoy is that the fries are a hit or miss. Sometimes they're good, sometimes it's obvious they've been sitting there for a bit. I forgive them though because their customer service is great. They are always happy and very chill. Their concept is very hipster though. Which has good and bad connotations in my book.The $60 lunch price tag was a little scary but when in Vegas...

The eats here are delicious.  Bottomless chips?  Sign me up.  The guac is also absolutely amazing, a meal in itself.  Prickly Pear Margarita?  Excellent.  Veggie tacos?  Awesome.  Basically the food itself is incredible but the prices are killer.  We probably could have gone without the guac but it was presented in this manner..."Would like like some bottomless chips and guacamole?"  Bottomless chips for $3 is one thing but $10 guac is something completely different.

Loved the ambiance and the outdoor patio.  The patio is nicely shaded from the hot Vegas sun and allows you to stare at passersby on the strip.  Service is pleasant and efficient.

I would eat here again but think twice on the appetizers and mixed beverages, which seem a little pricey.For a while I have wanted to try Rambo's out, as it is very near my house. Well, I finally stopped in and was not disappointed. My Sis-in Law said the Zucchini Sticks are a must try as they are freshly cut [whole zucchini] sticks, hand battered and prepared to order, I could not resist any longer. I ordered them to go and they were delish and so fresh, not too many places have homemade zucchini anymore let alone good ones! Atmosphere is cute, cozy and well just groovy! Staff was very friendly and after learning it was my first visit the waitress recommended some items she personally loves for my next visit...I will definitely be a repeat customer and glad such a great place is so close to home, Las Vegas needs more places like this.Others may be so inclined to usher you towards The Mosque Kitchen for some traditional food, but they'd be doing you a massive disservice. Kismot is absolutely one of the tastiest restaurants in Edinburgh. I've been a handful of times, and each time it has been stellar.

A recent development that left me a bit underwhelmed was their menu redesign. The menu has been drastically cut and the star rating system has been scrapped. Now, you're left with merely three levels of heat, mild, medium and hot. I take heat relatively well and medium had me sweating in my seat. 

In case you're wondering, they also offer the Kismot Killer challenge for ¬£20 (I think). It's a ridiculously hot dish that is 99% chilli seeds. Our friend from Bangalore was pressured into accepting the challenge, and he was less than thrilled to be eating it. After three big hulking bites he quit. 

The staff here is stellar. They are super nice, talkative, accommodating and knowledgeable. If they take a liking you may even meet auntie in the back!

The only reason this place is receiving 4 stars and not 5 is the loudness. The place is very open and conversations echo quite a bit. Therefore... if a stag or hen party is there then you may as well assume you won't be hearing much else than their banter. 

The place is BYOB!If you are looking for a good burger, this is definitely the place.  Sitting at the counter is a MUST to get the entire experience of this old school counter burger and fries.
I'l  definitely be going back!Uni focused pub...
Tasty buffalo burgers...
Tuesday night pub quiz...We stayed at the Golden Nugget for three days and had a chance to enjoy the buffet twice; both times for breakfast.  

The service was exceptional but you can't really screw up serving coffee or juice (well, maybe you can, but this was definitely not the case here during our visit).  We found all of the breakfast items, as well as all of the items on the buffet, to be very high quality.  Hot foods were hot and cold foods were cold.  The freshly made to order omelettes were very good; the ingredients very fresh.  

This made us very happy.  We would definitely go back.Fannnnnnnnnnnnnnnn-fricken-tastic!
I love to eat here
I love to sit here
I love to talk here
I love to meet here
If I were a plate of food I'd want to be served here
Everything I have had has been lovely
New chef is fantastic
Weekends are perfect
What more can I say? I agree with all the other high star remark-ers!Cost: $17 (w/o tip) 

Came in and asked for recommendations, got the veggie Spanish omelette as one and decided to order. 
Also ordered the chocolate milk to replenish my calcium supplies but they were out. Then ordered the half apple/half orange juice and they didn't have apple juice. Finally settled for the typical morning breakfast OJ.

The omelette was cheesily tasty, with multiple layers and a generous amount of soft gingers embedded within the layers. Combining this egg concoction with the spicy salsa sauce made it even better.
It was a very filling meal, especially with the tall glass of OJ. 

The service was great. The waiter was friendly and active in attending to all customers' needs. He continually checked in - but thankfully not too often - and was quick in solving any issues. 

Overall, a tad expensive but highly recommended, would come again.Love the garlic parm wings!!!!Came here for happy hr, which runs from 4-7 everyday, half off app and 2-1 drinks. It gets packed so come extra early or tip the sever to seat you!  The food was average nothing really stood out but nothing to complain about either. Really enjoyed their oysters and hummus though. The view is great, I never got to see Vegas from that view before epesically coming to Vegas so often and now living here. Really nice place to take a date without having to break the bank ;) The drinks were good, we got the mango and apple martini followed by 4 shots of patron.  Would definitely come back for happy hr especially when I have friend in town.So I've lived by this place since it opened. I never went. When my mom arrived here in November, my brother took her here for lunch and brought back leftovers. She brought back adobo and oxtail soup. I ate the leftovers and thought it was pretty good. 

Then, a few Sundays later, I met up with them there and we ate lumpia shanghai, the Thelma's special, adobo, pancit mix, oxtail soup and shoyu chicken. For desert we had banana lumpia and ice cream in a bowl. 

Then a week later, I told Chris about it and he said, "Dang I'm jealous, I wanted to go too!" So we did. We shared and adobo fried rice and lechon kawali. 

Then when my dad came, we came here again and pretty much had the same things, except my dad had some kind of fish soup (I forget the name of this fish) and the food was just as delicious. So...this review will be on the items I have eaten thus far.

The portions for the price are decent. Even though my plate was a "2 choice" (pork adobo and pancit mix with one scoop of rice and one scoop of mac salad), the way they serve their meals, and you can easily share with whoever is dining with you. My brother had the shoyu chicken and Thelma's special and my mom had the oxtail soup. The food was plentiful and with tip came to about $50 (with 3 beverages). Seems kinda pricey for a Filipino joint, but this isn't some pick from a steam table place. It's a sit down and wait for some good grub kinda place. 
I like supporting Filipinos. I like supporting Filipinos that I think are from Hawaii. (Almost everyone that was there had some kind of "I'm from Hawaii" type shirt or had their "Island Pride" sticker on the back of their vehicles.)  I like supporting businesses that treat their patrons with respect and are appreciative that we're spending our money in their establishment. 

My only suggestion: the banana lumpia ice cream mix thing is yummy...just wish they put in 2 lumpias not one. I had to share this with my brother and was about to deck him for the whole thing (j/k). It was one scoop of ube ice cream with the banana lumpia sliced up and mixed together. Thanks Thelma's for giving me the idea to do that at home!! 

Too bad I only itch for Filipino grub once in a while (yep, gotta watch the HBP and cholesterol since I'm not a young un' anymore!). But if I do, I'm coming back to Thelma's. 

P.S. They have musubi there. Like 4 or 5 different kinds. Next time I'm going to try their longanisa musubi. 

Bonus: It's about 6 minutes away from my house!Gustung-gusto ko ng masarap na pagkain.

I am honestly somewhere in between a 3 star rating and a 5 star rating for this place, so that is why the four. Not perfect but pretty damn good.

We came with an appetite and ordered a crap load of food. We ordered so much food, they moved us from a small table to a big table. Yeah, it was just me and my hunny and my son.

The following is what we devoured:

Spam Masubi
Longanisa Masubi
Lechon Kawali
Marinated Bangus
A mixed plate with: rice and macaroni salad, shoyu chicken, pancit mix, and squid guisado.
Another mixed plate with: rice, squid guisado, pinkabet and dinuguan.

I fell absolutely in love with their lechon. Some of the best in this valley that I have tried to be honest. Their mang sauce is definitely not watered down like other restaurants do. (My mouth is watering just thinking about the lechon now). It was fried perfectly with a perfect ratio of skin, to fat, to meat. And most importantly, it didn't leave a greasy feeling in my mouth.

The bangus was on point and was boneless. An extra plus for my hunny. 

The squid guisado was delicious as well. Not overpowered by the bagoong.

I find that a lot of places fill their pinakbet with squash and this was a good balance of all veggies. 

Both of the masubi's were delicious and the fact that I could order a longanisa masubi made me very excited.  

Honestly, it was all good. Except the dinuguan left me very disappointed. I was not a fan of the taste or texture of this one.

We spend a little under $40 for all the food and had plenty to take home. 

Just know that if you order hot tea, it is simply a lipton tea bag and they give the hot water and lemon and honey. 

And if you like they play TFC on the TV.

Gawin ang iyong sarili ng ilang mabuti at kumain sa Pilipino restaurant na ito nang hindi bababa sa isang beses.What a great little place! I believe this took over the old La Madonna space, and my goodness did they improve on the space! It's bright and airy and makes me feel like I'm on vacation somewhere very un-vegas-y! I had brunch and had a very difficult time deciding because of all the great options. I ended up with a turkey burger based on the waiter's suggestion. I was certainly pleased! There was a delicious mango chutney on it, and the turkey itself had some great spice to it. I asked to add lettuce tomato and they added a beautiful fresh heirloom tomato (oh my gosh *squeal* I LOVE heirloom tomatoes!) The owner was there and couldn't have been nicer! Great food and great service, who could ask for more?! I can't wait to try it for lunch and dinner during the week! Hoorah!Stayed here for a week. Isn't the most gorgeous place on the strip, but it ain't the dirtiest.
This place serves all the needs I have. clean room & bed sheets, working AC & friendly service. Casino is decent and the casino directly connects to Paris Hotel.
If your on a budget with your wife/gf or just friends and want a nice decent clean room right across the Bellagio, this is your place.Good price range. Lots of cute accessories. I probably spend way too much time in here. I think the best idea would be to shop for a specific outfit like one you just bought because it narrows down the options. I found one sales person helpful, he showed me a few different things. I don't remember anyone else that worked there.My wife decided she wanted to try the Buffet of Buffets for her birthday last month. I'm not a huge buffet fan and the prospect of eating at 7 buffets in one day was not something I was looking forward to. But it was her birthday so I agreed. And I have to admit I was kind of looking forward to trying that many places in one day.

Our plan was to hit every buffet in one day. Did we make it? Let's see...

We started our journey at 7:51 a.m. at Le Village at the Paris as we wanted to try their breakfast crepes. I had lyonnaise potatoes, chicken and bacon sausage, an assortment of cheeses, warm cherries, scrambled eggs with lox, and poached pear. It was all very good. My wife had a banana and blueberry crepe and eggs Florentine which were also good. The waitresses were extremely friendly and the setting was very unique and Parisian. The Paris had the best service of all the places we tried.

Next we walked to the Emperor's buffet at Imperial Palace. We figured this would probably be one of the worst buffets so wanted to get out of the way during breakfast time when most places have the least selection. We were right. This was BY FAR the WORST buffet we tried. I did not like this one at all. Not much looked appealing. I only had a Little cottage cheese, a tomato, and a fried shrimp. The shrimp was rubbery. My wife had a mushroom salad and a macaroon. The macaroon was decent. There are many much better buffets in town. I will not be back.

We then walked over to Flavors at Harrah's. This was the surprise (almost) gem of the day. There was lots of variety and not just your standard buffet fare. I had shu mai, bananas foster, banana pudding, corned beef hash, and fried plantain. It was all pretty decent. The downside was the service. We had to wait 20 minutes for our drinks (soda and water). I hate eating without having a drink to cleanse my palate. Several other patrons were also getting noticeably upset by the delay with the drink orders. Good selection and food, but definitely the worst service of the day.

After 3 (albeit very small) meals in the same number of hours, we needed a break from eating. So we walked over to the Flamingo and strolled through their bird sanctuary area. It was a lovely day and I really enjoyed looking at and reading about all of the birds, fish and turtles.

Next up was the Paradise Garden buffet at the Flamingo. This was a middle of the road buffet. The crab legs were kind of sad looking. The Mac and cheese was tasty. The desert bar was one of the best of the day. I especially liked the chocolate fountain with strawberries and marshmallows to dip in it.

By this time we really were not hungry, so we decided to walk through the Forum shops and watch a couple of the free shows there.

After that we headed over to Lago at Casear's. I thought this was going to be one of the better buffets. I was wrong. This buffet was just okay. The crab legs were bigger than the Flamingo's and the Mac and cheese was good. The cookies on the dessert area looked dry. So-so overall selection.

By this time we were getting tired and my phone was starting to die from taking pictures and writing reviews all day, so we headed back to the Paris to sit in the car for awhile and charge our phones. When we got to the car, I couldn't find my keys. Keep in mind we had walked all over the strip and through the Forum shops. Many of the keys on my key chain (including my car) are the only set I had. I didn't even know where to start looking for my keys. We figured we'd retrace our steps and start calling every hotel and buffet we'd been to. We were already at the Paris so I first stopped by the buffet to see if they had found my keys. HALLELUJAH! My keys were there. What a relief!

We returned to the car and rested for an hour or so. Then we walked over to the Spice Market buffet at the Planet Hollywood. This ended up being my favorite buffet. They had a great selection. Highlights were the lamb and baklava. By that point, I wasn't really looking forward to another buffet after grazing all day, but this made me want to actually eat again. That says a lot when you're on your 6th buffet of the day.

Next we walked around the Miracle Mile shops for awhile to burn off a few calories before hitting our final destination.

Lastly, we drove over to the Rio for our finale at the Carnival World buffet. The Rio was the biggest of the buffets and had decent quality. This was my second favorite. Nice variety with something for everyone. We finished around 9 p.m.

We talked about getting up early and hitting a breakfast buffet before our time ran out...but the next morning the last thing either of us wanted to do was eat.

I'm glad we did the Buffet of Buffets, but it was definitely a once in a lifetime experience. I don't ever want to eat that much again in my life. It's a great deal though and I would consider buying a pass again and just hit up two or three of my favorite buffets.the kiki burger is awesome.
so many *unqiue* burger choices you really can't go wrong.. i'm sure you will find your favorite.
decor is nice, service was good when i went.I wanna say first I'm a burger and beer kinda guy. I've been here twice so far and each location I've been to has had fantastic service. I don't think you can go wrong with anything on the menu. Seriously!!! I've tried a lot of it
Try the Cherry Yuzo soda it'll keep you coming back for more. 
I truly love places like this. They've honestly put an amazing new twist on something so classic.The in-laws are in town and they wanted to give this place a try because they had seen it on TV. We also brought a bottle of wine along (heads up, corkage is $20) to celebrate their arrival.

We ordered the steamed pork buns, sweet potato fries, a ronin burger, and two miyagi burgers; one with mayonnaise and one without (for me).

The sweet potato fries were perfectly cooked; not too crispy, oily, or floppy like most places make them.  The pork buns were also really delicious, but the buns weird me out (sorry).  My burger was literally the bomb dot com.  The fried egg was perfectly cooked (not too runny but still yolky), the burger was juicy and tender, and the bacon... Mmmmm!  I didn't like how uncooked the fried onion rings seemed to be, but I'm not an onion person. I took a few bites with them on and eventually gave them to dad.  The burger was really messy, but I don't care.

*Note: I dislike burgers and typically stay away from places like this and I can't wait to go back!This is an outlet JC Penny!  The selection is limited.  However, everything is marked down.  I've purchased some things here, returned some things here, and they are easy to work with.Never having had Korean food before, we decided to have a food adventure. So we went down to Soyo late on a Sunday night. Neat little place. They apparently need to hire some people though.

The Good:
Ambiance, Tin Bowls for drinking, Soju, the prices, and the food, at least the Tofu soup and the Korean BBQ ribs. Also cooking food at the table is still entertaining and several dishes come with a million little addons. 

The Bad: The staff were clearly running their asses off but we didn't see a lot of our waiter. Maybe we were supposed to wave them down, I saw this being done a few times (and not in an impolite fashion). All the interactions we had with the staff were good, but they were clearly overburdened. Maybe a few people called out. This dropped the review a star. Also I would have liked sweetener for the Barley tea but it was fine.

Surprising Positive: Loud Korean Pop Music. It's great! Who knew? Also the amount of beer on tap is pants-tighteningly fantastic for a place this size, and they have Rogue Morimoto Soba on tap! ITS FIFTEEN DOLLARS A PITCHER. 

Questions I developed: Why are there  at least four rubber chickens hanging up? Also is the media on the shelves for sale? What does all the stuff on the walls say? I would have asked but the servers were swamped.

I will go back. I need to make a Korean friend to explain more to me, but had an overall good experience. HIRE ANOTHER WAITER.SO YO' check this....beasty beats play in the background at this joint that make you want to bust a move....even if you are a reserved conservative asian =)  Besides the music, the decor and atmosphere of this establishment makes this an ideal place for a little get together with friends...or in our case a party of 16. FYI they do take reservations for larger parties, just call ahead!

The one item that I HAVE to order when I come here and I would rank on the list of BOMB DIGGITY items....is the beef short rib and vegetable stew....imagine tender, succulent braised short ribs in a sweet savory sauce served in a hot stone pot!  I think all the dishes I've tried have been excellent including the grilled squid in garlic, sweet and sour marinated pork, korean ramen/rice cake with sausage casserole, seafood udon casserole....just to name a few.  Like all other Korean establishments, the meal comes with banchan (Korean side dishes)....one special one they have that I haven't seen before are these little nuggets of beef (possibly oxtail?!)....delish!   The brown rice tea comes in little bottles on the table, but the cups are metal bowls (in case you are wondering what they are for)...that kind of look like dog dishes....but hey it works!

I wouldn't recommend coming by yourself....this place is definitely better in a group...so you can go family style and taste a little of everything!This is my go-to neighborhood korean restaurant. Love that they are always open late and never too crowded. We usually order the marinated short ribs or gaal-bi, and korean fried chicken which are musts. Stone pot bi bim bap is also very good, as well as their fried mackerel. They offer very few sides, but you can ask for more of something if you like it.I can't compare this to any other exclusive pool scene as this has been the only one my wife and I have been to. We had just planned on going to the regular pools at Aria when we spied this place and became curious. There was a podium we passed that had guys handing out VIP passes to young ladies walking by. When my wife and I stopped, they did their best to ignore us...it was actually quite comical....let's ignore the paying guests! LOL That's a strange business model. Finally one of the gents asked my wife if he could help her....she asked about the club and fees. He said she could definitely get in for free but that I would normally need to pay. But then he said it was fairly slow, so he gave me a pass as well. We didn't have our ID's so I ran back to the room to get ours. The club staff were actually fairly pleasant and helpful. We shared one lounge chair given the $100 minimum. It was after 3pm so we weren't going to splurge for two lounges. After 4pm, one of the staff came over and said we could take another adjacent lounge for free. The majority of the customers were 20-30 year olds and we're quite friendly and very amusing to watch. My wife and I likened the final bill to being the same as a show bill......except the customers were the show! We had two pitchers of margaritas and two bottled waters. The grand total was somewhere around $170.00 with the tip. The venue was cigar friendly, so I was quite content in sitting back, smoking my stogies, sipping on a margarita and watching the madness unfold. Actually, a couple of people came by and remarked how good my cigars smelled and wanted to know where I had gotten them. The staff seemed to be having as much fun as the crowd. One of the waitresses was thrown in the pool by a few of her coworkers. The music was bass pounding hip-hop....not exactly our thing but it was a great soundtrack for the spectacle. Overall we had a good time. The staff was very attentive....coming by to refill your glass, empty your ash tray and make sure you didn't need anything else. The club closes at 6pm and when we left we could very clearly see the lack of any vibe at the basic pools. They were nice...but very laid back. So, it's all in what you are looking for. The people watching value in Liquid was pretty priceless!Chips is one of the best stores around for old consoles and games. With a hint at nostalgia, they sell Gameboys, N64s and other such classics of the gaming world. They also have a fair few games for each of these consoles, obviously fewer for the older ones but still a healthy amount. 

Obviously not that many people go into game stores looking to pick up a Sega Megadrive on the cheap, so Chips also has a wide array of games for modern consoles. All the new releases and big titles for the 360, PS3 and Wii are here. Because it is an independent store though, you will find they are slightly more expensive than either in supermarkets or online. There is a good pre-owned section as well, if you are looking to pick up a few games on the cheap.

Another advantage of this place is that they do console repairs. If you have got something like the renowned Xbox red ring of death then if you take it here, more often than not they'll be able to fix it for you. The staff are always really friendly as well, and knowledgeable about all the new games. It's overall a good independent video game storeWho doesn't like noodles?  

While you can get noodle-based dishes almost anywhere, China Magic Noodle is special.  Theirs are hand-pulled to order, by someone I can only describe as a Magic Noodle Man.  From the window between the dining room and kitchen you can watch the stretching spinning process as they are created, just for you!

While I love the noodles (and I have tried four of the five varieties offered), the real attraction for me are the steamed dumplings.  They also have a pan-fried version, but I like the steamed ones better.  They are amazing - beautiful, huge, pork-filled packets of goodness.  I have at times skipped the other dishes entirely and just had dumplings - they are that good.

What would happen if that Magic Noodle Man decided to go on vacation?  Or realized that hand-pulling noodles was no longer his career calling?  I can tell you that for me, the world would be a little less Magic.Super interesting dining experience---- It was as if two worlds has collided-- a jersey shore nightclub and a good California steak house. It was incredibly loud but you are  dining at a nightclub--- what should one expect....
The music is loud and its obvious that this is where one should go if they want to be scene ie; they have a photographer taking pictures of different tables/ groups around the venue. Music is a good mix of mashups and top 40. 

Service is really good-- no complaints. 

We ordered the beef tartare, carpaccio, and iceburg salad to start and then filets for dinner. The meat was delicious--- The pesto pasta with the carpaccio was amazing! 

I wouldn't recommend bringing a date to this place unless you are trying to get wild.....What absolutely love about this place is the upbeat atmosphere.  They have a DJ (but not too loud) who plays upbeat music to keep your energy high if you're planning on staying out afterwards.

Not necessarily a place for romance, though.

The food is pretty good and the cocktails are outstanding.  I definitely recommend topping your steak with the truffle butter.

Service was a tad slow but when our waitress was around she was knowledgable and friendly. 

You MUST try the sweet potato doughnuts for dessert!A friendly environment, the food is delicious, the cost of dining is reasonable and great for groups. A nice gathering with family and friends before flying out to the east coast.Cupcakes so good you wouldn't know they were vegan. The owner was really nice too!Our original plan was to go to Light at Mandalay Bay but it got bought out on Christmas Day so my promoter got us on the list for Surrender. I'm really glad he did. This club is super fun! The staff outside was also nice and let us wait to the side while our friends returned from the casino bathroom  to go in. We barely had to wait in line since we had wristbands thanks to my promoter and us ladies got free chamagne all night. Super nice bartnder kept giving me two at a time :D I thought it would be cheap stuff but it was really good. The DJ was playing good stuff and the dance floor was big enough for people not to be bumping into us. Altough the bathroom was tiny I don't think I ever had to wait in line. Aside for XS and Marquee, I think it's one of my favorite clubs!Good ole Sweet Tomatoes!  AKA Soup Plantation!  The restaurant is very similar to Souper Salad but with a facelift.  It's a myriad of unlimited salad items, endless soups, unlimited fountain drinks, and an infinity of hot carbs.  These restaurants have a monthly theme where they utilize in-season fruits/vegetables to create special dishes aside from their already existing menu items.  February's theme was potatoes (ex. cream of potato soup, potato salad, etc.).

The West Flamingo location is the newest Sweet Tomatoes in the area and even boasts outdoor seating that overlooks the great I-215 (also a great view of Home Depot).

SALAD
Fresh pre-made caesars, pre-made cold pasta salads, pre-made broccoli salad, etc.  The salad bar also boasts tomatoes, cucumbers, spinach, lettuce, cauliflower, and tons of other veggies!  For the chef salad fans, they have feta and cheddar cheeses, hard-boiled egg, croutons, and a boat load of different salad dressings.  Grilled chicken is extra $.

SOUP
I've never really been a fan of their soups even though I've tried many of them :-\.  Each restaurant has about 3-5 different soups.  

HOT BAR  
Mac and cheese, Iike theirs because I like Kraft.  Perfect for the kiddies.  They also have at least one other hot pasta but don't ask me, because I stick to the Kraft.  While you're up there the have hot potatoes that you can load up, different bread sticks that are pretty yummy, and muffins!  OMG the blueberry muffins are to die for.  Put the honey butter on them--euphoria!

DRINKS
Unlimited of course, just like everything else.  They offer Coca Cola products and also have different iced teas and juices.  Mix and match you crazy barista!

DESSERT
I always stuff myself on the blueberry muffins, so I never visit the ice cream.  Yes, I said ISCREAM!  Dreyer's chocolate and vanilla, soft serve, if you will.  The sprinkles and chocolate sauce aren't just for the kiddies either, go ahead, I won't tell.  Don't forget the hot cobbler!

Overall, I love Sweet Tomatoes.  They are casual, consistent, fresh, good, and cheap.  Meal+Drink= under $15Anyone who knows me knows I love three things: the city of Chicago, Spanish tapas, and b-boys. 

I fell in love with Jabba after their "PYT" performance on ABDC. So when they announced they were taking their talents to Sin City, I knew I had to see them. 

A solo birthday trip to Vegas included tix to this show. I did the advanced internet discount since it was only me. The theater isn't very huge, and there isn't a bad seat in the house as long as you are in SEC 1 or SEC 2 (shell out a few more bucks and stay away from the upper balcony level).

I really enjoyed this show because it made me laugh and I was entertained from beginning to end. I thought the music by The Bangerz was an excellent soundtrack to the moves. What made it even more special was the show took place on the anniversary of MJ's untimely death.

I would have given it 5 stars if my favorite member of the group (KB) performed, but sadly, he didn't. However, I think it's still a great show for diehards.Caught there show last year in November and they got the crowd into it from the time you sat down till the credits rolled. It was entertaining, funny, inspirational and all that good ish. Music had be bangin my head the whole time. Show was a lil long, like watching a good but long movie and they never took there masks so u never knew if it was really the original guys some subs off the bench. All in all it was a good show and good to see filipino/asian cats come up and doin it big!Good homemade burger join with hand-cut fries and fresh bread. Everything is made to order and very tasty. They have a huge selection of sodas if that's your thing. I definitely will be coming back.Rocket burger has the best milkshakes in town. My lactose intolerance was cured. (Not cured by the milkshakes it was some godly miracle if you're lactose intolerant wait until you get help) good burgersI don't really understand the concept of jewelled lollipops although I can see why the celebrities think it is all high and glam..... I didn't even want to look at the price, or ask about whether there was anything special about the lollipop flavours because it just wasn't my cup of tea.

What was my cup of tea was their gelato :). On a hot hot 40+ degrees day in Vegas - all I can think about it Ice cream!

Looking at their case of flavours, I always try to find something that I've never tried.. and then the mojito flavour caught my eye. Having a quick taste - it was identical to the drink.. i was hoping there was alcohol in it! The mintiness of it was so refreshing and just what I needed on such a hot day!

If only it didn't melt so quickly in the hot hot heat.............. I wanted to enjoy it for as long as possible!They had me at NUTELLA LATTE! You just don't get much better than that. Unique drinks, great atmosphere, a table for your laptops, etc... this is a great place. 

My only issue is that I don't get to hang out there more often!Don't drink coffee but I would definitely come back for one. A variety of items, will try something new everytime I come byConsistent like every other Chipotle. Cant say much more, if you have been to one, this is just like all the rest.I kind of love this place.  It's a little pricey if you don't hit happy hour, but the food and drinks are consistent.  And I love beer.  I almost always end up eating appetizers here.  The Ahi Poke stack is yummy and so is the grilled artichoke.  The wings are mediocre and should be skipped.  Don't hold a candle to BWW. The truffle fries are delicious.  

Although it's a small patio, it's a nice patio.  And I find it pretty freaking awesome that in addition to the microbrews offered, you can find such stand bys as Pyramid Apricot Ale.  I don't care if I am a loser for ordering a Pyramid at YardHouse.  I did it, so there!To preface this review: I am from Chicago, and snobbishly so. I've lived in Madison for 5 months and most of the food doesn't really satiate my palate. I've had Full Of Bull twice, and they make excellent sandwiches. I ordered online and have had both the burger and the italian beef. Both were incredible and satisfied my arrogant taste. 

The curly fries make the restaurant that much better. They are delicious.

Delivery is a bit long.Great sandwiches...good introduction into China Town.  The food was good, good enough that I am glad they are at least 15 minutes away.  Sandwiches should not taste that good for 3.25.  More important the staff was very nice and help to some people out of their element.This is the first and only ramen place I have been in Vegas.  We all got some sort of ramen... as for other stuff on the menu, i haven't tried so not sure if it's good... my friend got this rice thing with fish eggs on it... he had a few bites and left it... apparently not good.
I plan on taking my parents to this place for ramen when they visit vegas! Highly recommend the ramen.This is where I lost my ramen virginity so I can't say if it's the best but I truly enjoyed it.

There was a bit of a wait but I am told this is normal.  Its a small space and a bit noisy so don't expect a quit spot.

The food was great, cheap and served fast.As soon as you walk in - sign in! Haha There's always a wait for this place.  (But if you're in a hurry to get back to work or wherever there are multiple of good restaurants you can go to in that same complex). So with that statement, it's the type of place you order--- eat--- and leave... You don't want to be the jerk holding up the wait :P 

One thing that really caught my attention was how the chefs were dipping the bowl into hot boiling water before making your order to keep your food hot even longer.  I like to enjoy every bite of my food so by the end of my last bite my soup was still warm :P ( but I'll have to admit the last time I went they didn't dip my bowl ) 

I've tried all three fried rices on different occasions and all were good :) I think the kimchi is my favorite.  As for the  gyoza, it's pretty delicious and crispy.  

I've tried all soups and I'll have to say I'll stick to the pork broth with thin noodles and of course adding some green onions and egg to that - call it my usual order :)I recently attended a convention here, which gave me the opportunity to explore the majority of the property and many of the rooms over several days. There is a large entryway that leads into their stylized lobby,  where TVs were playing repetitive videos of a woman's silhouette dancing with what looked like a mushroom cloud in the background. The rest of the area is decorated in largely black and white with silver/mirror accents and large 'plastique' purple chairs. There is a recurring theme of a 'little birdy', a nod to the idea of hearing a rumor from one. 

The outside area is comprised of a lawn area to the left and an enclosed pool to the right. The hotel is several buildings that are connected by stairways. The rooms either open directly to the outside with a small grassy area in front of a sliding glass door or out to a patio. It seemed that they came with a variety of room layouts, but that could have been due to the way the rooms were being utilized by their occupants. There are cheesy 'artsy' photos that are the same in every room, which was quickly apparent. 

The rooms seemed pretty comfortable, though, with large beds and plush comforters, as well as many offering lounge chairs or benches. There were other events going on during the convention, such as BBQs, live music and live demonstrations, so it was quite lively. It seemed like the hotel really tried to cater to it's occupants and show them hospitality.

I can't speak as to whether the rooms are reasonably priced, however the facilities are pleasant. I believe the hotel is owned by the same group that owns the Artisan, near the 2-15.Naked City Pizza Shop, hidden inside Moon Doggies Bar.  

I've been to Moon Doggies a few times over the years.  It's a nice dive bar with real character.  It's a good change in a town where it's hard to find such places.  Going here is a little intimidating the first time around, but definitely a fixture to this city.  Naked City is a welcomed addition to Moon Doggies; the previous pizza place that leased the kitchen was not that great and left the watering hole void of food offerings for a few years.  

This was my 2nd visit to Naked City, and we just can't seem to get away from the daily specials that the chef has to offer.  (The chef is also the owner, waiter, delivery driver, and busser)  

The special on our first visit was a hot roast beef dip.  The thing that set this apart from your average French Dip was the addition of horse radish sauce and a roll seasoned and toasted like garlic bread.  This was excellent.  The beef was also unique; it was roasted in house and cut thick, but still remained tender.  I hope this special becomes a regular item.

The second visit we tried the pulled pork Bolognese.  Extremely flavorful, but may be too bold for some.  This was a deliciously refined dish, much too soigne to be served in a dive bar.  However, this fancy plate of pasta fit perfectly with the approach of Naked City, offering unexpectedly great food in a blue collar setting.  

We also tried a few of the regular menu items between the past two visits:  The medium wings were very flavorful, but had a sweet note to them.  I'm a simple guy when it comes to me, so it wasn't my cup of tea.  The garlic knots were excellent, I really recommend.  The "Naked City" Pizza is very well executed.  We also tried the Poutine.  The Poutine is a must have and needs to go on everyone's bucket list as a must try before they die.

Naked City is losing a star for the location.  Food is amazing, but the neighborhood is a little scary, and the bar is extremely smoky.  I must also warn everyone, do NOT order soda from the bar, I don't think they have every changed or cleaned their soda lines in 20 years.  Stick with the hard liquor or beer.A trip with family to Vegas means no clubbing or drunken shenanigans. First thing on our to-do list? Look for a Vietnamese restaurant.

The Vietnamese-Chinese cuisine sign initially deterred us from Pho Kinh Do but to our pleasant surprise, it turned out to be more authentic and tasty than many Vietnamese restaurants in the Bay Area. We ordered the family menu which included dishes like Ca Kho To (catfish in claypot), Canh Chua (tamarind soup), Ga Xao Xa Ot (lemongrass chicken) and Thit Kho (saut√©ed pork). My family, including those visiting from Vietnam, agreed the food was flavorful and comparable to a home-cooked meal. 

We returned again before leaving Sin City and this time tried Pho, Hu Tieu Nam Vang (Seafood soup), and Mi Hoang Thanh (Wonton noodle soup). My mom and I are pretty tough Pho critics but we agreed it had a very good soup base. The other soups were pretty good too.Large portion and a fair price! Sure beats the Pho spot I was contemplating inside T.I.Good food, friendly people. We like the Gold Strike Burger -- we get it almost every time. Also try the shrimp appetizer and the bread pudding dessert. Appetizer and dessert, plus a Kiltlifter Beer or two, is sometimes all you need. 
The only sad thing is, because they are a bit off the beaten track, they will have to close for the summer, until November. We will miss them until then.As I was turning onto Durango last night, I saw none other than the Fukuburger truck zoom by.  So I did the only rational thing and started following a food truck wrapped in bright red towards an unknown destination.  Besides, it's been awhile and I've only tried them once, so it was time for a do over.

I tried the Karai burger again, the same burger that I had during their 4th of July opening.  And let me say, it was a great improvement.  I wasn't overpowered by salt, and the beef patty seemed much larger.  Now THIS is a burger I will pay for.  The burger sauce isn't too spicy but is tasty.  Now to taste the rest of the menu...I expect to enjoy this process.My husband and I have been here a few times and the food is amazingly good.  I highly recommend the Fukuburger and the Karai (Spicy Burger).  Both are excellent.  I've tried the Tamago as well and the egg is just a little too heavy for me.  But with a variety of other options and terrific fries, it's a great food truck for late night cravings.  

I also like that they are participating in pop up dinners (next one at Retro Bakery!).  The one they hosted with Jet Tila of Wazuzu was amazing!  The money curry, Thai me up sandwich, and chicken and waffles were all super delicious.  Fukuburger staff did the cooking, showing that they are super versatile and talented. And pop up dinners are a great idea.  I'm glad they are starting them in Las Vegas.  Fukuburger is a valuable addition to the Las Vegas food community for doing this.

When visiting this truck, keep in mind that their following is pretty young and you have to be in the mood to deal with it (see Elizabeth E.'s review - jackass teenagers pretty much sums it up).  Also, there are some stickers on the truck that you may not want to have to explain to your 5 year old and you also don't want your five year old picking up some of the words being yelled by the customers. But they are great about packing the food to go so it stays warm and tasty!  Just swing by and enjoy some Fuku at home!Tis me favorite burger currently raoming the Vegas desert.

I eat 2-4 at a time. They are regular-sized burgers too, not a tall slider. The sauces give the burgers a good and tasty twist from normal burgers...a little bit of tang to go with the meat. 

$5 a burger. And they have other creative dishes as well, like their version of chicken and waffles.Fukuburger is not your typical food truck or roach coach. Before the recent food truck movement, people rarely perceived these 'kitchens on wheels' as outlets they wanted to eat at. Today, the public's mindset has done a complete 180 and FT's like Fukuburger are now experiencing large, almost cult-like, fan followings. The reason why Fuku has gained such notoriety and acclaim can be attributed, in large part, to the unique menu items that they offer and their ability to successfully execute their food on a consistent basis.  I've eaten at Fukuburger numerous times and have had the pleasure to experience each of their Asian/pacific-island inspired burgers. My favorite burgers are the 'Kinoko' - mushroom burger - and the 'Fuku-Burger' - lucky burger. Though, the item I order the most is the Nagadog; no visit to Fuku is complete without it. I love the crisp snap of the hot-link sausage; the creaminess of the wasabi mayo; and the crunch and texture of the kimchi - there's no better hot dog on the planet. Other items they offer include the 'Loco Moco' and 'Naga Moco'. The Loco and Naga are almost entirely the same dish and only distinguished by their main source of protein; Loco - Hamburger patty and Naga - hot-link sausage. Both of them come with rice, one fried egg and gravy; a great meal to have for when it's cold outside.I was a little worried for this location when they first opened b/c my husband, friends, and I didn't think the food was as good as the Firefly on Paradise.  Being that this Firefly is so close to our house, my husband and I went back to give it a shot during happy hour.

I'm happy to say that months after opening, the food is just as delicious as it is at the other Firefly locations, and they are still always busy!  Definitely make a reservation, and if you can...get there early!  

Little tip...since it's a tapas restaurants, the portions are snack size.  Order just a couple at a time so the food stays hot and you can stop when you're full.  And check them out during a happy hour.  All drinks are half off including pitchers!

We especially love the Blood Orange Mojitos, any of the Sangrias, the Steak and Mushroom Skewers, the Mussels, the Clams (are BOSS!), the Empanadas, the Albondigas, and the Mac n Cheese is great here too.  Really anything you order from here will be awesome!  Oh and for dessert, be sure to try the Banana Nutella and the Bread Pudding!  YUM!Amazing food! Seriously..the tapas are phenomenal and the sangria is on point! Only negatives would be they can get pretty slow with service and getting food out and sometimes the crowd is a little loud for a restaurant. I have had to literally shout to the person sitting right across from me. But overall, the tapas make it worth it. And the waiters, though sometimes slow, are always nice and helpful!Ever since Kukuruza Popcorn in AZ Mills shut down I've gone to hell and back to try and find a cheddar popcorn that could stack up to theirs. I used to brave that hell hole of a mall just to fill up on those little kernels of cheesy salty goodness. Well, when AZ Mills started its painfully obvious downward slide towards ghetto-ness, Kukuruza lost it's market and was one of the casualties. 

For a couple years now I've yearned for some cheddar popcorn that could compare to Kukuruza's. I had no luck until I found Popcornopolis. It's a new little popcorn shop in Chandler Fashion Square. I heard about it through one of my brothers rants...he was ranting about how people spend way too much money on stuff that should be cheap...his first example was this popcorn place he had seen in the mall (this place) which charges five or six bucks for a tiny bag of popcorn...his rant should have turned me off like it was indented to...but it did the opposite, it put Popcornopolis on my radar. 

I decided to go pick some up before seeing a movie this last weekend. I figure I'd go spend about five bucks on some 'expensive' popcorn, yet still save money from what I would pay for underwhelming theater popcorn, go figure. Upon entering, its clear this place has a really artisan appearance...it looked like the type of place you could get some mighty tasty snacks in, just based on looks alone...even if you are paying a little more than usual. We were greeted by one of the workers who asked us if she could 'give us the tour'. Of course we said yes to that! What followed was a unholy barrage of samples of just about every type of popcorn I could imagine. We were given samples of probably 15 or so different flavors of popcorn...we were given so much free samples in fact, that I was almost too stuffed to actually buy some. Just to name a few...here are some we tried:

Cinnamon Toast - Tasted remarkably just like real Cinnamon Toast.

Sour Cream and Onion - Tasted like a potato chip...very strong onion flavor.

Almond - Fresh and crunchy with little pieces of almonds...quite good.

Zebra - Way too rich...too much going on with this one.

Kettle - Perfect mix of salty and sweet...some of the better kettle corn I've tried.

Nacho - If you like spicy, you'll love this...my mouth was on fire after just a couple pops.

Cheddar - And now for the big daddy of them all...the whole reason I tried this place. I'm proud to say that Popcornopolis knows how to brew up a tasty batch of cheddar popcorn. Strong cheesy and buttery flavor...crunchy on the outside yet soft and chewy on the inside...with a healthy coating of flaky cheddar cheese powder...I finally found a cheddar popcorn to replace my old flame. 

If you're in the Chandler Mall area...I say give this place a try. It is a tad on the pricier side...but at the very least go in and get some free samples. Popcorn if done right can be such a gourmet treat, and Popcornopolis is one of the few places that nails the concept of 'gourmet popcorn'. They also sell some pretty good lucking caramel apples and chocolates, but I didn't leave enough room to try any of those. I hope this place succeeds, so that I'm not stuck with a cheddar popcorn void in my life...every few months I NEED cheddar popcorn, is that so wrong?! In the meantime I better go wipe this yellow cheddar powder off of my upper lip. 

4/5.The Informatics Forum is a fantastic new building at the University of Edinburgh. It has a beautiful, big atrium and is excellent for events. I attended a conference there today and the main lobby and beautiful areas on the ground floor were excellent for the coffee and lunch receptions, and the conference room was also very nice with big windows. I'd highly recommend it for events, and the catering (Edinburgh First or Blue Sky) is usually great too!we were looking for mexican food in our trip to vegas until we found this place.........

we tried the carne asada tacos and were great, but we came back the next day and ordered a shrimp cocktail and it was THE BEST shrimp cocktail EVER.

I have tried a lot of places for a good sea food cocktail but none compare to this one, all natural shrimp and octopus (optional) lots of avocado and the hand made tortilla chips were hecka good...... and dont even bother to order the small size cup, go for the large size if you really like sea food,

our kids ordered the quesadilla and the torta and were excellent as well,
the place is clean and prices are decent.

the only reason for the 4 stars is the lack of fresh salsa bar and tortilla chips provided to costumers when waiting for the order. Almost forgot,..... they could inprove the fish ceviche tostadas........... 

overall the place is worth the traveling from the strip (like 10 mins) and the money......Very good sized tacos! They are 3 dollars with any meat and extra 1.50 for crema, cheese and guacamole! I love, love avocados so I was very happy when I saw a lot of guacamole on them! I also ordered the mango agua fresca and I though it was pretty good considering that It was only 2 bucks for real fruit! The only bad thing is that they were pretty busy at lunch time so we had to wait a while, on top of that they forgot to make my bfs order so we had to wait even longer .. Overall a good Mexican food in a clean and pleasant restaurant!The food is just amazing. A little over price in my opinion. Oh and registers need to be more specific in regards add-on pricing.We had never heard of this place and so glad we got introduced to it! My husband and I absolutely love Mariscos and have always gone to Mariscos Sinaloa (48th Street) because we knew for sure we were guaranteed Mariscos there! Well, now that we met Baja Joe's we are completely sold! Service at both locations can be slow on a busy day or time, however, when you start comparing quality and portion size, Baja Joe's is a win! I had a shrimp cocktail (abulon, shrimp, octopus) and my fish bowl was seriously packed with seafood! Not just full of vegetables (cucumber, tomato etc.) like the other Mariscos restaurants. My husband had the Malificio (combination of oysters, scallops, drowned, shrimp  and octopus), which he too loved. We eat Mariscos quite a bit and have never experienced this and we will for sure return! They are not shy at all on their seafood portions. Thank you Baja Joe's!

PS..The salsa was extremely tasty and good, you need to try this place!Came here early on a Friday evening for dinner.  Maybe we just weren't in a rush, but I didnt see any problem with the service like others have mentioned.  Decent wine and beer selection, probably about $1 more per drink than I'm used to seeing, which for the atmosphere here was fine.  It has a nice modern feel without crossing into yuppy.

I ordered the baked ziti with chicken, which was really good.  The boyfriend had a filet, which was good but drastically overcooked- he ordered medium-rare, and it came out nearly well done.  He decided after the first bite it was still good, so I can't fault them too much since we didn't complain and give them the opportunity to fix it. We also got a side of truffle tots, and you could really taste the truffle oil, I recommend those.

Overall, good place to grab a drink, food was good, and the atmosphere worth coming for.We were in Edinburgh from the US on vacation and stumbled on this place. The bar staff was awesome. Very friendly and after a couple visits they greeted us by first names. Only downside is I wish they served chips or something, actually the salty snacks make for more beer sales. This is my favorite bar/pub in Edinburgh and hope we can make it back there soon.A great place to go for some laughs! I was there with a group of friends to see another friend of ours perform on Saturday night. 

Stand Up, Scottsdale! is a big room inside a restaurant inside a hotel, but that shouldn't stop anyone from enjoying the place. It feels small, but still has a pretty good set up. It caters more to local up and comers, and the headliners aren't all that big of a name, but for the low price they charge, you can live with it. The club has the expected two item minimum, but the drink prices were more than reasonable. Food and drink all come the restaurant, so it's real food and the typical "club" menu at other places. 

The waitresses are good, but there's no real system to their service. When we sat down one took our order, then two more asked us what we wanted. They probably should try to do a better job of zoning the tables, but then again I'm complaining about people trying to serve me, so I guess that's not a bad thing. They also didn't do a good job of blocking the shows. We were there for the 10:00 show, but the 8:00 show got out late, and ours didn't start until after 10:30, and it let out around 12:30.  But, it's Saturday night, so that shouldn't be a problem for most people.If I've got to have some fast food, I may as well get something I enjoy. Chipotle always seems to hit the spot without being a grease bomb. I've had some issues with using the order ahead on the site and coming to pickup (showing up at or after recommended time and they didn't even have the order in front of them) but they usually can still have me in and out in a few minutes.

I haven't tried too many of the other things but everything I have tried, I've liked. My drug of choice? Black beans, sour cream, lettuce and pico, hot, and corn salsas.Just had a delightful lunch here.....can hoghly recommend the escargot, the salmon arugula salad, and the stuffed avocado salad. Owner was delightful, and the food was delish! We sat outside...a beautiful afternoon. The only reason I did not give 5 stars was the traffic noise outdoors on the patio......maybe that isn't fair, but in another location this would be absolutely 5 stars. Give them a shot....the service was friendly and quick too!  Enjoy!I went for a dessert adult drink :-)  The service was great and I loved learning about the Alice mug which I purchased.  Come here for what they are known for - the chocolate!  mmmm.  They also let me know that they are building a Max Brenner in SF and I can't wait for it to open!Recently moved to AZ from CA.  Needed to find a stylist who knows how to cut hair.  Found a great stylist at Lynn-Matthew Salon who listens to what you want and follows through with a great haircut.  Call and make an appointment with Harley.George IV Bridge, which pretty much stretches between Bristo Square and the Royal Mile, is a very interesting street.  It contains a whole host of diverse shops, caf√©s and restaurants, as well as the National Museum of Scotland, the National Library and the Central Library, and that site of bewilderingly constant tourist interest, Greyfriars Bobby.

It also allows you to have the novel experience of walking into a building from street level, and then realising you['re actually standing on the 10th floor.  The NAtional Library of Scotland is an especially good example of this, as it has floors and floors of bookstacks stretching down to the Cowgate and below.  I think this is kind of cool, but sometimes it can give you a headaches and make you feel like you're in an M.C. Escher painting.This is a wonderful fast food place.  Extremely courteous staff, which is so rare at a fast food restaurant.  The place appeared to be very clean as well.  I am very impressed with the employees.Just walking by and seen a milkshake that looked oh so good and haven't had in a long time. It was a orange cream shake and I was craving that. 

Very good and prices aren't bad at all.This was our very first time at the Magical Forest.  The staff from Opportunity Village were great, super friendly.  We visited the first weekend of December. We paid the $20 option, which included all the rides (carousel, mini golf, slide, train & mini racetrack bikes) and the beautifully decorated Magical Forest.  Its a great place to take the kids, we were with my bestfriend, her 7yr old and we had our 1yr old son and it was perfect for all of us.  We took pictures w/ Santa, paid $16 or so for a 5x7.  Since it was earlier in the month there wasn't a wait for pics w/ Santa which was great.  They snap a bunch of pics and you choose the one(s) you want from their computer.  We stopped in their little cafeteria area and bought a hot cocoa for $1.50.  It would have been a little nicer to have more vendor choices for food & drinks but all in all we had a wonderful time and we'll be sure to come back again next year.Delicious, smooth and rich!
Needs more flavours.This ain't Taco HELL (play on Taco Bell, if u didn't get that one?)!!!

Like Tacos Mexico, I really like their intestine tacos =) YUM.
Don't judge the deep fried goodness that is intestines....all things fried are delicious.
Just something bout eating it with fresh veggies and salsa. 

I can't get enough of it but, it's soooooo far from what I'm used to driving. Which is prolly why I crave it all the time...I'm quite obsessed with carne asada fries. And I really haven't found a good place for asada fries in LA since I've left SD. But that hunt will have to continue. I want to talk about the AMAZING carne asada fries here in LV. Carne asada fries loaded with (real!) avocado, cheese, and some of the best carne asada I've ever had with crunchy fries. Ahhh...drooling just thinking about it right now. 

Bf tried some of their tacos and those were mighty delicious as well! All their tortillas are hand made fresh in store. 

OH! And they have Orange Bang!!!! I'm in heaven!!!

Things I did not like:
- PRICEY! $2 for street sized tacos, $10 for carne asada fries
- Confusing ordering stations: you order different things from different stations 
- pretty far off strip (but there is a closer location to the strip)Ah Rosati's-you had me at "lunch special". My boss will pretty much only get pizza from Rosati's-swears by their magical cheese, sauce and dough combination. After having pizza at the Cosmopolitan, I didn't think it was possible to love another pizza again, but Rosati's runs a close second.

I've only been here for lunch and can't emphasize what a sweet deal this is! It's a pizza/salad bar situation and will run you about $7. All you can eat. Seven bucks. They only serve their thin crust pizza for the lunch special, so if you're not ok with that this may not be the lunch special for you,  however this is some dang good pizza. The crust is perfect, thin and crisp and the cheese on the pizza is SO good. The proportions of dough, sauce and toppings are always spot and for $7, I really have no complaints!

The staff has always been friendly and helpful when I've been in and the only reason I knocked a star off is because every time I've been in here, there has been a fly (just one!) buzzing around and interrupting my pizza binge. Kind of annoying when I'm trying to eat my weight in pizza. This won't stop me from coming back to take advantage of a steal of a lunch special!My friend is a die hard Rani's fan, so he dragged me from my strip hotel so we could eat Pani Puri and Chaat at this hole in the wall restaurant tucked away in the back of an Indian grocery store.  The store itself seemed a bit disorganized and the staff not super friendly (not like I expected great service though), but the food was delicious. 

We started with the papdi chaat which was delicious.  One thing I noted with this dish which is different than most papdi chaat dishes I've eaten in the past is that the papdi was extremely crispy as though they made these just for our order.  The pani puri was     also delicious and the chutneys are amazing. If you're in Vegas and want to get away from the strip and try some local (non-hotel) food, check out Rani's.Friendly staff and most importantly a good hair cut!We like the food at this place, everything seems so fresh.
We had wraps (gyro and beef skewer). They come with fries or salad, we chose fries and ordered a shirazi salad side. We also got the stuffed grape leaves and they were delicious! They come in a plate with a pita, cucumbers, and yogurt dip. They were warm... I think I never had warm dolmeh but it was really good.

My beef skewer was not as tasty as usual, I do not know if it needed salt, spices or something, but it was not as good.

Everything else was great. Doogh was good but we still miss the home made one : (This bar is really cool (no pun intended).  The staff was fun and friendly and the drinks were pretty good.

We met a lot of awesome people in here and ended up spending way too much time inside. 

When I went outside I was drunk off my ass but it was really fun.

Good experience overall.Located at the corner of S. Jones and Spring Mountain near the 168 Market, this small humble eatery provides a comprehensive array of Taiwanese breakfast items that elicit childhood nostalgia for many 1st generation Taiwanese/Chinese folks and are definitely on the must-eat list for those of us second-generation folks who have been fortunate to have made a pilgrimmage back to Taiwan (or as I like to call it, Foodie Island).  

Soybean milk-  this is not the chalky stuff that you find in your supermarket that adds a nice dimension to your latte or cereal, this is enjoyed straight up either as a sweetened cold/hot beverage or in a savory form where a shot of vinegar and soy triggers a reaction so that the soymilk takes on a creamy custardization accented by little bits of green onion and pickled veggies.  For those with discernible palates, I've been informed by reputable sources that the soybean milk across the street at China Mama is superior.

Rice Ball (Fan Twan)- a classic item my parents used to grab on the go while heading to school, don't be fooled by the simple name.  This is steamed sticky rice enclosing a savory deep fried chinese doughnut and pork sung.  The ratio of the rice and filling is perfect and it's as classic a combination as pb and j.

Temple meatball (Ba Wan)-  not sure if there are any other places in town that offer this, and fortunately they make a wonderful version of this popular street food item.    Finely chopped mushrooms, bamboo, and stir-fried pork encased by a glutinous tapioca flour bun and bathed in a thick orange sweet savory sauce that has an additional note similar to cinnamon/star anise, this one will flood your head with umami and makes me think if boba and dim sum were to conceive a rockstar child, this would be it.

Spicy Beef Noodle soup-   Served piping hot and can easily feed 2 or more, the meat is impeccably braised and comes with garnishes of pickled mustard greens, cilantro, scallions, and bok choy.  Detractors might say it is on the oily side and is way spicy (in which case the version at Noodle Pot may be closer to your liking), otherwise this one punches you in the face and is not shy on flavor in the best way possible.

Leek Pancake- A deep-fried empanada filled with garlic chives, scrambled egg, tofu, and mung bean noodles, this is a tasty rendition if you really like garlic chives.

Items that have room for improvement include the savory chinese doughnuts (yiotiao) and the sesame bun (sao bing) which I found to be a tad bit on the dry side, and the hunk of pork in the pork bun (gua bao) is also a bit oversized and lacking unctuousness (Sheridan Su does a better rendition at Great Bao which is now Fat Choy).  Looking forward to trying the pork chop with rice, sweet tofu custard (do hua), and the lotus wrapped tamales (taiwanese and shanghainese varieties available) on future visits. 

Not sure if this is an outpost of Yi Mei Deli Co. in Rowland Heights, CA (the fonts on the food signs look similar), but if you're expecting the same level of quality, it may come up short since they set the bar extremely high, otherwise it's a great primer on Taiwanese cuisine for the uninitiated.  Unbelievable value for your wallet but don't forget cash if you're spending under $10 and they accept visa/mastercard but no amex.Huge wall of tvs is hypnotic. Funky furniture is hip and comfy.  Food is great -- sliders are fantastic.  Many to choose from.  Friendly staff, attentive and tuned in to the menu. Draft beers tasted watered down a bit (imho) although I didn't get this confirmed from staff. Recommended, overall.Best wonton noodle soup in town.

The noodle in the soup was nice and firm, the soup itself was so tasty with lots of flavor from diffrent spices and a very strong but sweet flavor of seafood. Wonton was very good, it was made with shrimp and pork. They cooked the veggies just right, not too raw and not too soft.

I have been here three times already. I am not impressed with other stuff on menu, but maybe it's because after the wonton soup, everything else seems second rate.This place has really come along. Jeff is doing wonders here. Haven't found anything on the menu that hasn't been excellent and the Craft Beers are coming weekly now it seems.

The live music has started, on a small scale and will only improve the heads through the door. If/when the Drink Specials follow, this is going to be the Go-To place.

New Diners: Mention Yelp BOGO 1/2 Off Lunch EntreeDelizioso!  I had the best puttanesca ever!  I changed the pasta style to spaghettini and it was amazing.  The service was also excellent.  My husband had the spaghetti and meatballs.  He said that the meatballs were very good.  There was live entertainment in front of us, which added to the fun experience.  There's an Otto in New York.  I'll have to try that one, too.  Hopefully, the New York version makes awesome puttanesca.  Fingers crossed!Wow! It took having my initial review as ROTD to remind me to update.   So, yeah.  I am definitely a regular here.  The tofu tacos ($1.99 ea !) are my go-to quick lunch.  Two tacos (comes with the sweet potato fries) are enough to fill me up.  Sweet soy marinated tofu + lettuces, cilantro, and green onion in two little soft corn tortillas.  Served with the same trio of sauces (soy, gojuchang, salsa) as the bibop salad.  

The guys who work there are always so friendly, and it only takes a few minutes to get my food.  Bonus, if you call ahead, they'll have it ready for you!Yummy, spicey Korean torta! Great service. No need to chase a truck to get the STUFF. Great service, definitely worth it!One of my favorite bars on the Strip. I'm not much of a "clubber" so this place really fits the bill when I've had too much casino and need an enjoyable way to spend the night. The food here is alright; the bucket of wings and tater tots are pretty good as far as finger foods go and reasonably priced considering the prime location.

However, what really appeals to me about PBR Rock Bar are the drink specials, which in my experience are unparalleled on the Strip. They have a different special every night, but I think your best bet is to try and get there for an open bar. Wednesday is open bar for college students (although I think you can still do it for a slightly higher price if you're not a college student) and Sunday night is $10 open bar just for following them on Twitter. You can't beat it!

Oh, and once you've had a few, make sure to ride the bull. If you've ordered food, your receipt gives you a complimentary ride.We came here on a Saturday evening. Doors open 30min prior to 7pm 

- Entertaining! Very interactive with audience participation, makes it memorable. 
- Since I watch America's Got Talent from time to time, I had to watch one of the highest placing NON-singing acts to ever compete in the series' history. 
- Great use of everyday items like power tools, ladders, buckets and trashcans. Who needs an actual drum set when you got skills like them?! LOL
- Table seating. No heads in my way. Easy view sitting at table 69. Can order cocktails. 
- For those that like spoilers, what you'll get is RED vs BLUE, Random Cookie Time, Top-10 Countdown Rock Hits, a Van performance, and a Ladder Performance, Audience performances with Monkeys and Drumstick catches. 
- Audience can win Headphones! Awesome. 
- You can grab a drum stick. Bang all you want! HAHA. Total tinitis afterwards. Worse than a club, but lots of fun. 
- They support Anti-Bulling. 100% of their merch, I heart Grammy. Admirable.I'm here all the time what can you say it's a 99c store. They do have fresh produce everyday last min items for a good healthy dinner.I had an opportunity to try a slice at the Las Vegas Foodie Fest this past Sunday. I'm glad I did!

I love the concept of the mobile brick oven. I had a slice of the veggie pizza. The crust was nice and thin. The cheese was gooey but not overpowering (I hate when there's so much cheese that it becomes chewy/rubbery half way through, luckily this slice wasn't like that). 

I was in a half-food coma from all the little bites of food our group was trying but I do remember there being mushrooms and onions on the pizza. It was very tasty. If we were headed home I definitely would not have minded an entire pie.Really enjoyed this place. We had an EXCELLENT server and goddamn if I didn't forget his name already (Aaron? Eric? Sorry, dude...) LOTS of different types of tequila and our server really knew his stuff. I'm not much of a tequila drinker (too many shots of Patron followed by an 18-hour bout of hugging porcelain many, many moons ago) but he pointed me toward a few types that either had a slightly sweet or non-existent aftertaste that went down smoothly, with no lime needed. Nice! Food was good too - mini tacos are tasty and come three to an order. You do have to pay for chips and salsa but the chips are to freaking DIE for, thin, warm, crispy, fresh, salty, PERFECT.Red velvet pancakes are good, they are light and fluffy and not too sweet. The melted mini chocolate chips on top add a nice touch. I eat the pancakes plain and don't add any syrup or sauce because they get really sweet if you do.  I also ordered a side of garlic rice which was tasty until I took a big bite of garlic paste that wasn't spread through the rice well.
Expect to have a long wait if you come for breakfast, they tend to get busy and if they could move to a bigger venue that would make things better.

Would I go back? Only if the wait to be seated wasn't 30 minutes plus.

Weekdays are probably better days to go than the weekendMy buddy brought me here as a surprise he didn't know I tried to come here before and I didn't stay because of the wait. 

Man what a great surprise the food is good the coffee is good the price point ok. Really small place but nicely decorated. The wait staff is friendly and decent service. 

I had the red velvet pancakes and I have to say their signature dish is awesome! The cream cheese syrup with whipped cream and chocolate sprinkles...I need to run a couple extra miles to balance this out.

Place has decent food and great red velvet pancakes. This is truly a treat place.Really nice selection of affordable quality wines both international and stateside, huge beer selection, and Palermo's Pizza if you need some dinner. Seriously, you gotta like that.  A clean and pleasant place that is locally owned.

Located in something of a small strip mall, right next to Summit CU at the corner of Sprecher and Cottage Grove Road. It's much more spacious inside that you might expect.I was worried coming here because there were few people here at 7 and from reading reviews. But the service was great. And the food was awesome. I had the Malay massaman curry. Perfect spiciness. And the mango margarita was more of a martini but it was awesome. I definitely recommend this place. And sit by the lotus pond if you can.Osso bucco! Great food great service!Great bar area and a pretty good selection of food. The bartenders and very friendly and attentive. The wait staff is decent, the seem as though they are in a hurry at times even if the place is not packed. Overall a good place to hang and watch a game with all the TV's they have there.A few co-workers were talking about the amazing dessert from this bakery so I stopped by last week to get some treats for a happy birthday party.  I purchased slices of 2 of their giant layered cakes, a mango/papaya cake, a berry cake and an √©clair.  I also picked out 6 of their adorable cookies.  All of the treats were a hit!  If you like sweets, their selection is fresh, homemade and flavorful.These guys are also fast and excellent when I order takeout food. Their lumpia shanghai platter is not only cheaper than at Goldilock's but is also cheaper.This was alot of fun. I saw it on "Millionaire MatchMaker" and knew we had to put this on the list for things to do in Vegas. It's on freemont street which some people say is better than the strip, but I prefer not to return...

We walked in, they weigh you, you sign a form, and then go up to the 5th floor to zipline. It was freezing that night, but we waited in line for about an hour or more to have our turn. They put you in the straps you walk up and then zipline down freemont street! It was a fun experience. I'm super scared of heights so standing at the top waiting my turn was terrfying but fun. It's $20 to do it at night where you can see all of the lights. If your in town and just want something fun to do, give it a try!Tasty! Very tasty! Ok so I've never been to the East Coast and I'm an Arizona Native so the only comparison for this burger joint is other burger joints in the valley. 

The burger is actually a double, you order the toppings individually, and they have the standards. They make it in front of you which is nice. The pattys were tasty and the buns were some of the best on a burger i've ever had!! Fries were good as well.

We ordered two burgers, one side of fries and one drink and the total was $18.xx. Expensive? Well it's more expensive than McDonalds of course but not more than a restaurant, it's a good middle ground. I think you pay for the quality. I definitely don't mind paying extra for a great tasting quality burger! 

The decore was......um....interesting. Pretty white everywhere. Peanuts as an appetizer?!? And on the wall was non-local reviews. I rather have local reviews but that's all minor. I went to get a good tasting non-fast food chain burger and that's what I got. I'm happy, and will be returning, probably several times. 

FYI-If they had alcohol, they would have gotten 5 stars from me. (It'd be nice for "fast food, sit down joints" to take a page out of the Chipotle handbook) umk that's all.Love that I have a farmer's market this close to home. 
AND that they bring cheese made close to prior home!! (Bay Area)
I buy these cute little soaps with herbs and grains in them that look way too fancy sitting in my whale mouth soap dish. They make me happy. 
The produce can't be beat. About the same price as a Whole Foods or Sprouts, but you know. Fresh-er. 
I ran into a booth last time selling infused waters in mason jars and mistook it for Santa's sleigh. So glad I found them!
My son loves the flavored popcorn booth. 
This is one great little gem!I love In N Out Burger!  When I went yesterday I think it may have been a bit of an off day for them.  Customer service was great, staff was very friendly but the fries were a bit on the stale side as well as the hamburger buns.  Also, they had the AC running and I think it might have been only in the 70s outside.  Having the AC running doesn't help with keeping the food hot on your table.  Other than that everything was great.I've been to the Garage a few times generally for a long lunch, they are usually pretty quiet and I can catch up on some e-mails while getting a quality craft beer. They don't serve the domestic swill so if you drink boring light beer continue on down to your local sports bar. I over heard the owner mention he didn't know what a Gastropub was until someone told him he opened one, he did a good job I enjoy frequenting his place.

The service is good, bartenders and servers make recommendations and I haven't been let down yet. The burger is quality and can't beat the price, I love the flatbreads and they always seem to have a good special at lunch. If you have a chance to have the chicken meatloaf sandwich give it a shot you wont be let down. People have mentioned and complained about service and I can say that this place can get busy especially during weekend dinner hours so if you're impatient, don't be, get a drink and enjoy yourself and the atmosphere and the weather, especially when the doors are open to the patio.

My only real complaints are the rear parking, its tight and limited, people who park out front consistently back into the poles, the rear entrance forces you to enter through a small smoking section that can be dirty and smell of smoke and if you sit in the booths there is a faint smell of tire as there are 3 hanging on the wall... but maybe that's just me.We had a great time! Yelpers were pretty right on, my guy and I wanted to try a fun massage and this worked out great! Will totally be back next time we are in Vegas. 

A few things: 
* great for first time massage~ since you keep your clothes on
*they do sometimes talk on cell phones, but I think if it really bothers you please ask them to stop ~ they were very nice about it 
* Check in on Yelp and tell them an show them the check in an get 10% off
*** Best part we felt like Jello after the hr. and only paid $34 a person :) !!
Great deal, nice people and wonderful massage :)

** There is also a really cute Boba Drink Shop next door and perfect for afterward :) 

Have fun!Food and service were great.  We went for breakfast.Smashburger Review - My experience and WHY you should eat here!

This was my first time going to Smashburger, after hearing good things about it from my brother and a few people I know. 

Overall experience was great, but let me break it down for ya. 

Menu: 

- Simple (small selection, but easy to read and make a choice)
- Signature burgers and chicken sandwiches
- Variety of salads
- Build your own choices
- Regular size and Big size to choose from for your burger

Service:

- Very welcoming and helpful when I asked questions
- Brought our order out to us after we ordered
- Wait time was a couple minutes, not bad at all though

Restaurant:

- Clean and modern looking interior
- Open seating, booths and tables with chairs
- Comfortable booth seats and lot's of table space
- Clean restrooms

Food:

- BBQ Bacon Cheddar Burger was great, good size and cooked perfectly
- Sweet potato smashfries were AMAZING, prob the best I ever had
- Girlfriend got the Mushroom swiss burger, she loved it, good size too
- Girfriend got the regular smash fries and they were good, nice and crispy
- They also offer beers, and let you have it in a bottle or a mug

Cost:

- More than I was expecting, but the quality and service balanced it out. 
- If you were to compare the prices from burger joints now a days, it's not much    
  more expensive when you really think about it. The dollar menus is what makes 
  up for their "regular prices" if you break it down. 

Smashburger Review Continued:

** Our bill came out to about $20 after everything. Considering the quality, service, and options, it's worth it. 

** The "Smashfries" are tossed in olive oil and herbs, and given as an option for both regular fries and sweet potato fries. Cost a $1 more I believe than regular fries.  

** When you order a burger or chicken sandwich, the fries are NOT included and will need to be ordered separately. Cost is about $2-$3 depending on if you choose regular or smashfry style. 

Smashburger would be great for all types of people, great for a casual dinner or lunch, and even better for a good place to grab some food and a beer without going to the bar. 

Overall experience was great, will definitely be going back very soon, and would recommend this place to anyone whose looking for a good burger or sweet potato fries. 

If your NOT a "cheap-ass", then you will definitely respect this place, but if your a person whose life is run by your money, instead of YOU running your own life, then this place is NOT for you!

Hope this helped. 

Please leave comments or connect with me on facebook. 

Until next time,

Anthony

PS: If this smashburger review was helpful, please show some love!I've eaten here a few times, and I think it's a great lunch spot, especially if you're staying in the Cosmopolitan. 

I've tried a few of their burgers, but the Rising Sun is by far the best. They also have an amazing selection of beers (both on tap and in the bottle). Service has always been great as well. 

I would recommend making reservations if you can. It can get busy around lunch time.When I had to make my way across the "skywalk" to work on the other side of the street, I always took a "short cut" through the Cosmo upstairs.  After our dinner at China Poblano, I learned to pay more attention to what else was up there, which was the reason why I zeroed in on Holstein's.  And hey - any restaurant serving burgers that even utilizes the COW'S FREAKIN' NAME, had better be ready to 'bring it', as far as I'm concerned.  So when Bear and I selected it for our burger fix, we were prepared for - at the very least - a 'transformative experience.'

So was it THAT kind of deal? Nope, not really.  But you could do SO much worse.

First of all - as promised - I have to give a shout-out to our server, Amanda.  Just that right, attractive combination of smiles, sass and 'savoir faire'' (NOTE TO MANAGERS: GET this woman a raise, STAT!) I've always loved that in the better restaurants in town, the staff always have an 'inside/out' knowledge of the menu and the daily specials, and in this particular area, Amanda did not disappoint. (Which is why Holstein's gets an extra star.)  With so many different styles of burger to choose from, it could have been an all-day task to select just one, but with her help, I chose the Nom-Nom Burger ($16.50), while Bear went "classic" and got the Gold Standard ($17.50). 

Pricey? Well, DUH! What does anybody expect when they're using Kobe and dry- aged sirloin to craft the frickin' burgers? (And don't forget - this IS a 'Strip' joint we're talking about here, people!) And while we waited - but not for long - we got to check out the unique decor that included anime-style artwork of the Holstein's "mascot".  Cute...especially considering that he's on the menu as well as the wall!

For our 'intro', we had the Buffalo Chicken Dip ($12.00) a cluckin'-good twist on chili con queso served with warm tortilla chips, and Bear's 'de rigeur' item to try, the Cuban Street Tacos ($13.00) a delicious menage-a-trois of roast pork, ham and Swiss lovingly drizzled with pickle and spicy mustard aioli. The bite I had of one of them made me wonder if I should've gotten a separate appetizer as well....

And then came the burgs.  Bear liked his Standard just fine, and I added some 'meat candy' (aka BACON!) to my Nom-Nom for about two bucks more. I didn't know if I expected a burger with barbecue potato chips and 1000 Island dressing to actually work, but damn if didn't, and in quite a tasty way, too. (But then again...name one thing that doesn't taste better with bacon on it.)  It was quite the stunning companion to my Frozen Grasshopper Shake ($11.00).  And the fries served with were just the way I like them: crispy, spicy shoestrings, with none of the greasiness you get from other burger joints.

So, sure, Holstein's is giving up burgers, but not at Jack-In-The-Box prices, so it's always best to keep that in mind.  And as repeat visits go, I think we can file this one under "Special Occasions" mostly.  And we will always ask to be seated in Amanda's section...If you're looking for a snack that isn't sushi or tapas, and maybe a cocktail to go with it, this is a decent place in the Cosmopolitan.  I had a cobb salad and spicy Bloody Mary, which were both totally worthwhile.  I nibbled on my wife's sliders too, which were excellent.

Prices are about what you'd expect on the Strip, but the service was better than one might expect.  Bottom line, we were happy and full after our visit here.Great burger.  Had the Gold Standard.  Dry Aged Beef Sirloin Burger With Smoked Bacon, Aged Goat Cheddar Cheese, Tomato Confit, Baby Arugula & Garlic-Chive Aioli.  OMG... so good.  This was actually my second dinner that night... and I still loved it.  This is now now of my top places for a burger.

Came back a couple days later for and had a Caesar  Salad with chicken.  I wouldn't really recommend.  too much dressing.. .and chicken was just meh...  Stick to the burgers.First of all, the wine list is quite impressive. One could easily spend 10 minutes or so perusing it. A very good amount of excellent half bottles available as well. I opted for the prix fixe menu and was extremely satisfied with a wonderful green salad, (not ordinary in the least) Scottish salmon, (excellent presentation but a tad underdone, you may wish to specify medium to slightly less than), and a perfect creme brulee.
If you are lucky to get a table by the window, the view is spectacular. The server was welcoming and seemed genuinely interested in having me enjoy a wonderful dining experience. (feel fortunate if your server's name begins with the letter R - I didn't ask if I could reveal her name for this review). If I could, I would give my experience 4.5 stars and not 5 only because of the slightly underdone salmon and the bread, while good (and the butter was of amazing quality), could have been a little fresher. Will definitely make another trip to this fine restaurant.One of the best happy hour places I've ever been in Vegas, and especially in the Strip.  Must try the cocktail menu.  The bartenders were more mixologists, crafting the cocktails rather than just pouring drinks.  I had about 6 cocktails but the Rose Eight and El Gaupo were 2 drinks that I was able to remember.  LOL.  .Alex and Lenny made our happy hour .  We tried about 4 dishes  in the happy hour menu and it isn't bad as some of the reviews mentioned.  I will definitely return here once I"m back.  Cheers Comme Ca!The service was really good I had the Tour of Italy very delicious and My Son had the never ending Pasta and Meatballs the soup and salad were great and the breadsticks yummy I will return hereReally enjoy me some Great Harvest. The free sample of bread that you get when you walk in the door is nice, but here's what happens to me every time I go there: 
I walk in and go to the counter where they ask which type of bread I would like as my sample. I quickly make that decision and get my large slice of bread with butter on it, then proceed to order my sandwich (which will most likely have waaay too many toppings on it). While I wait for the sandwich, I eat the bread. A few minutes later, they bring out my sandwich, which is great. And it looks so good! There is one problem, though; I'm not that hungry anymore! 

I literally do this every single time. I know, a little self-control would go a long way in my situation, but all of the bread is so good! Maybe there's something I haven't tried before. How could I pass that up? The sandwiches here are great, and I've thoroughly enjoyed every loaf of bread I've had bought from Great Harvest. The potato cheese is probably my favorite. 

The one issue I have with this place - and another review has already mentioned this - is the smell. It doesn't smell like a bakery, a sandwich shop, or even a food place. I don't know what the smell is in there, but it doesn't smell like food. At all. It's a little off-putting, but the sandwiches here are great and more than make up for the olfactory confusion. I go here whenever I'm looking for a sandwich, and it's pretty close to my house, which is great!Definitely impressed with Wicked Spoon buffet.  Saturday night dinner will set you back $29 per person which is quite a deal in comparison to other high end hotel buffets.   We came Saturday night and there was a 10 min wait.  I agree with the other Yelpers - dessert bar amazing, great variety of cuisines represented,  and awesome presentations and nicely portioned out for single servings.  Definitely worth a try!My new favorite buffet in Vegas!  Here's the thing, I've kind of burned myself out on buffets, especially after once doing all of the buffets on the Buffet of Buffets in 24 hours once, but my tried and true, hands down best has been The M... until now.  Don't get me wrong, I still think The M is awesome, but Wicked Spoon upped the ante.

I'd heard the lines can be crazy so I made my husband check in on Foursquare for three days in a row at Cosmopolitan hot spots so that he would have the badge that gets you VIP line access.  No worries there, since we went early... they open at 5pm and we were there at, um, 5:10, there was NO line.  I was surprised since it was Labor Day, but yea for us!  No wait to pay, no wait to be seated and quick access to the AMAZING food.

I was a little exhausted after the five mile hike to back of the Cosmo property to FIND Wicked Spoon, but luckily sustenance was mine.  What impressed me the most was that the food was presented beautifully AND it was very good.  A lot of times buffet food is just cafeteria food, but I did not get that at all from this one.  

I liked that they had your staples, prime rib, pork roast, etc at the carving station and crab legs and asian fare, BUT that they also had unusual items as well, like the General Tso pigs feet and I'm still kicking myself for getting too full before I tried the roasted marrow!  The selection is just a huge wow.  But, I noticed some things would run out quickly and I'd miss out... I never got to try the roasted beet salad, which is a favorite of mine.  

My favorite items were the prime rib (because that is always a fave for me), the build your own mac and cheese bar, the individual cheese plates (LOVE!), and this one strange little chocolate shot dessert thing that I can't describe for the life of me except to say, YUM.  I really enjoyed the "salad/appetizer" section because they had so many little interesting crostinis, cheeses, salads, etc.  I could graze there all night... oh wait, I did.  Oddly, my husband LOVED the dessert bar.  He seriously had three helping and this man does NOT have a sweet tooth.  STRANGE!

I feel like I missed out on a lot because I just get full too fast!  What I didn't care for was the chocolate lava cake - um, no lava, and the gnocchi I had was okay, but too soft for my taste.  Surprisingly, the angry mac and cheese did not wow me.  The flavor was good, but the one I got was super dry.  Darn it.

The staff was all very friendly and attentive.  It was $41 per person on Labor Day evening 2012.  I think that is pricey, but we all felt it was an acceptable price to pay to splurge for a buffet of this caliber. I'm guessing we'll be back.

WHAT CAN THEY DO TO GET FIVE STARS?
~the food, which I loved, was a little inconsistent - not everything was cooked correctly and that dropped them a half star.
~removal of used dishes more quickly would be a plus.  We found it odd that they would come by and remove plates, but never took our glasses away when a new one was brought so we had quite a collection of glasses - another minus half star.Really a great lounge to enjoy a drink. Minus one star because the two drinks I ordered they were out of the components. At our waitresses suggestion, I tried another cocktail and did not enjoy it. I would have sent it back but she never returned.Book & Stage I so badly want to bump your rating up to five stars but your spotty service is a line of orange cones on the road to a rating upgrade. The Book&Stage continues to be an excellent place to have a unique music experience in Vegas (hint: free and not top-40 crap) and an even better place to people watch. The bands booked here have always brought out a, how do you say it nicely, eclectic, group of people as well as the mix of people passing through on their way to Bond or Marquee. 

The service continues to be mediocre at best, and I want to give the employees the benefit of the doubt and guess that they have been stiffed by the eclectic concert goers more times than they can count. I get it. But I tip well. So don't make assumptions that I'm going to stiff you, because your Nostradamus prediction will prove true if your inattentiveness warrants a crap tip. 

Keep on keepin' on Book&Stage and get some upgraded training for your staff!The Vesper Bar is basically the lobby bar for the Cosmopolitan. It has a cool vibe and is very well located for people watching / making comments as the endless parade of people walk by. As one would expect at the Cosmo, it is aimed at the hipsters and those thinking themselves "in the know". Even so, the service is good and they make solid drinks. This is the best bar in the Cosmo if you are looking for a "mixology" experience.

We really like the menu. It is set up in two columns. On the left are classics made in the traditional recipe with quality ingredients. On the right side is the Vesper twist on the classic that is of a similar flavor profile, but with greater complexity or a thought provoking ingredient swap. For instance, one can order a classic Manhattan or the twist: "The Mulberry". The variation was in every way better than a Manhattan -- deeper, more complex, and a long finish. We tried several of their variations on a classic and thought they did an excellent job.Came here over EDC weekend. Love Jaleo's open kitchen where you can see the Chefs cooking the paella! Other reviews mentioned the poor service but our waitress was great! They change their menu occasionally so the brussel sprouts that everyone raves about is no longer available! The waitress also recommended 3-4 tapas for each + the large Paella dish BUT 2 each + paella was sufficient! 

Onto the good stuff: 

*Sangria: Of course we would order cocktails off an iPad, fancy haha. Loved the Sangria here. Not sure what was in it but the added sprig of mint made it even more refreshing. Order a Carafe for ~3 glasses. 

*Pan de cristal con tomate fresca (Half a loaf of toasted, uniquely crispy and ethereal bread brushed with fresh tomato): aka Tomato Bread. Delicious! Supposedly the bread is imported.It's a great starter! 

*Arroz con costillas de cerdo ib√©rico de bellota (Made with the ribs of the famous, black-footed ib√©rico de bellota pigs of Spain): So, the Chef chooses 2 of the 5 paellas to make each day. On this day, there was this one + the Rabbit one (Paella valenciana 'Rafael Vidal' A true classic of chicken, rabbit and green beans). It says allow for "45 minute wait" because you'll be served when it's ready. They continuously make batches. Once each batch is done, they ring a cast iron bell and yell out "Paella"! I've never been to Spain so I don't really have anything to compare it to. However, I like that the rice was "crispy". A little on the oilier side but it is pork. Meat was tough though. 

* Gambas al ajillo (The very, very famous tapa of shrimp saut√©ed with garlic): JUST DO IT. Sauteed with garlic but there's a rich & warm tomato-like "sauce" on it which MADE this dish. So good. 

*Chorizo ib√©rico de bellota Ferm√≠n (A dry-cured chorizo made with ib√©rico meat): eh, skip. tasted like a dry hot dog and it was on a bed of some kind of corn/polenta looking thing but didn't help 

*Ca√±a de cabra con higos (Murcia) A soft, semi-sweet goat's milk cheese paired with raisin walnut bread and fig jam: I don't like stinky cheese but something about this paired with raisin walnut bread & fig jam made this a winner! 

*San sim√≥n con garapi√±ado de frutos secos (Galicia) A smoked cow's milk cheese paired with house-made nut brittle: Loved this one because of how mild it was. It's a harder cheese but not like parmesan-hard. The nut brittle was tasty s well. 

*Manzana con hinojo y queso manchego (Sliced apple and fennel salad with Manchego cheese, walnuts and Sherry dressing): This was a nice palate cleanser. Super refreshing with the crispy granny smith apples + fennel.

*Coliflor con olivas y frutos secos (Saut√©ed cauliflower with dates and olives): Waitress said this is a hit or miss dish but we LOVED this. Sweetness from the dates. Tang from the Olives. Yum.This is a hidden gem of a restaurant. Very surprised at how good the food was. Quick service too.My favorite club in Vegas! 
I bought my tickets online for Kaskade, getting in was such a breeze. It took us no more than 10 mins. Kaskade blew my mind, his whole set was a full on experience. The good vibes and energy was amazing. We were on the main floor right under Kaskade and the cool bursts of fog, butterfly confetti, and strobe lights were so sick. Loved itI love that safelite always comes to my job so that I don't have to make special arrangements just to get my windshield replaced. When they originally came to my job they did not have the right pieces to go with my car.  Since I have a 2012 Prius c they told me they would have to order the parts and that the receptionist would call me to reschedule in a week. In less then a week they called me back, got me an appt right away. When they came to fix my windshield I was pleasantly surprised to find the tech had vacuumed all my floor mats and cleaned all my windows.  Even though there was an initial inconvenience overall I had a great experience with safelite. They are all friendly, great customer service and I would use them again and again!The COOLEST!SOOOO Good!!!

Pizzeria is a tiny little pizza joint on the 3rd floor of The Cosmopolitan.  I don't recall even seeing signs for it.  Someone told us about it so that is how we happened to find it.  

We first attempted to order on a Saturday night...well...Sunday morning after Marquee Night Club and were standing in line when I was plowed over by a very intoxicated Australian man.  After gaining my composure, he plowed me again.  Before I killed someone, I made the decision to come back later.  So my point here is...if you go late night, your experience may not be so pleasant as this place attracts the overly intoxicated/drugged.

My second attempt, which was late on a Sunday night/Monday morning, was much more pleasant.  The pizza guys aren't very friendly and I am pretty sure not one of them cracked a smile.  The girl who was taking orders, etc. ,though, was quite pleasant and tolerant of the late night clientele.

The pizza is delicious.  It is the thin crust, not overly greasy, cooked to perfection, perfect cut slice kind of pizza that is so rare to find!!!  Some of our crowd went back for seconds and to try different flavors.  I had the supreme and could not have been happier.

I will definitely be returning to Pizzeria for more pizza on my next visit to Vegas!!!So amazing, definitely a good late night spot. Born and raised on NY pizza and this is as good as it gets to compare.After 700+ reviews in a year and a half of being here, is it really fair to call this "Secret" Pizza?

Okay okay, maybe the moniker is because the place is unmarked, tucked away down a hallway next to a sushi joint, and you really will miss it unless you're looking for it. But it's still the worst-kept secret in the Cosmopolitan.

It's thin-crust (but NOT crispy) pizza and for slices, you're limited to handful of choices - cheese, pepperoni, and white pizza. You have more flexibility for toppings if you order a whole pie, but beware the wait. It took us upwards of 35-40 minutes for two pizzas, and save for a half-and-half topping on one of them, we didn't really order anything complicated. I was, however, extremely grateful for the FREE WATER!

The white pizza is the standout here. So much garlic and olive oil that it will leave your paper plate soaked. It was a little on the soggy side because of all of the oil, but at 2am, it's exactly what the doctor ordered. If you're wearing insane heels and you've just finished a night of going big at one of the clubs, you will want to sit on the couches outside of the place to relax and eat.

There is also a Donkey Kong arcade game inside the place. It's a great way to pass the time, but beware the Kong. It will suck you in, beat you down, frustrate you, tease you, and leave you with a hole in your heart. Have fun.We use to make the drive to the ghetto (67th and indian school) for their great food and now they have taken over a Garcia's in the burbs.  This place is always busy!  The food is your standard tasty mexican and prices moderate.  Much better than its former the Garcia.

Check it out and see for yourself!Have gone to happy hour here several times and have to say that the bar staff and food are excellent.  The fresh mozzarella is made to order at your table and definitely wortwhile.Great And friendly service... Ordered the burger and truffle totts! I'm not a huge Tott fan but they were good! Ordered the burger medium rare to medium but it came out well done.... I was hungry so it was still good at that point... And for a late night spot! Nice waitress/hostess.....I'm torn between 3 & 4 stars, so I'll be nice and round up since the service was friendly!We stopped in here for lunch. Despite the crappy weather that we had experienced the whole time of our visit, this place made me smile, the service made me smile and the food as well! I am very picky about service and food, may I just say it felt so nice not to have any complaints and the waitress was so sweet and accommodating. 
The potatoes with aioli are wonderful and I recommended getting the avocado and bread with fennel! Had a wonderful brunch!Tea....and Champagne never looked so good together.....while I don't drink either....the layout is phenomenal. If your every visiting the Scottsdale Quarter peep into this locale and you will be amazed. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!My wife and I sat at the bar on a Friday evening.... We both ordered the Cavatelli pasta with pulled braised short ribs, sun dried tomatoes, and spinach.... OMG! So damed good. The pasta is made there from scratch. And you can taste the quality. The dish was not drowning in sauce, so you could taste each ingredient.

Shawn (one of the managers) came by a few times to check on us. He even bought us by a few homemade onion rings for us to try....awesome!

The person sitting next to me had the steak salad....which looked incredible. 

My only "critique" (and it would not be a fair review without one) is that the dishes seemed a little on the small side. Most of the entrees are in the $15 - $20 range. So my pasta dish was much smaller than say I would get at the Olive Garden.... BUT the ingredients were all fresh and homemade. 

And I LOVE to support local non-chain restaurants.

We will be back!I grew up in NYC. I am still getting over the shock that there is more than one Grimaldi's... And that the other ones are in places like Arizona and Texas. 

It is not as good as NY but this may be the best NY style pizza I've had outside of NYC.  Which is not to say that it was fantastic pizza. The sauce and cheese are top notch. Simply fantastic. But the crust is what failed me. Not enough salt and too tough.  But hey- you can't make amazing NY pizza outside NY. 

It puts places like Flour+Water and Delfina to shame. The pizza is just as good, if not better, and Grimaldi's is far less pretentious!

I wish this was in SF or at least the Bay Area.Yum! I have been here two times. Today I had the Lengua and Fish Tacos. Super yummy. Last time I was here I had the Shrimp Tacos, those were super good as well. I will say though the fish was a bit tough like it was cooked earlier in the day, but still good. Definitely order at least 3 tacos, they are small street tacos, so it takes more than two to get filled up. I probably in all honesty could eat four and be comfortable full. The carmelized onions and jalepeno on the side are what makes them yummy, so dont leave those off.Try it, you wont regret it.This truck does not lie. They have buns and they are tasty.

My beef is that they never have enough buns, hence the 4 stars. I've only been able to try a few of their buns. The Mac N Cheese, the burger one, and one that was the special for the day. 

Their tots... OMG, are to die for. GARLIC TRUFFLE TOTZ. I could eat these all day, e'ery day. SOOOOO epically awesome. Really, they're so good, I wanna dip my balls in them (if I had balls).

They guys are super, duper nice and answer all my annoying questions. They're not as fast as other trucks, but I think it's because buns need to be backed and not fried.

Definitely check these guys out. It's melt in your mouth delectable!I thought the meat and cheese appetizer platter was delicious. The prosciutto was absolutely delicious as well as the different cheeses. The atmosphere was fun and friendly - very busy - with lots of people laughing and having a great time. 

I ordered the salmon entree. The salmon was cooked will and topped with sweet apples and pine nuts. Perfect portion to fill you up but not feel too full. Halibut fish and chips was delicious as well. Would definitely recommend.Got the lunch roll special to go! Rolls were good, miso was good, salad dressing was good, but the iceberg lettuce was pretty sad. All in all a great deal for $7.95!I took my 6-year-old son here for his first taste of frozen yogurt.  There is only one size of cup to choose from, and that is a little inconvenient.  You have to make sure you don't fill it to the top.  I had chocolate, and my son had a mix of cake batter, red velvet cake batter, and oreo.  They were all good.  In addition to those flavors, they had vanilla, tart, butterfinger, pomegranate, and a couple others I can't quite remember.  There were a lot of toppings to choose from.  Chocolate chip cookies, cut up moon pie, dark chocolate, white chocolate, and milk chocolate chips, karob chips, sugar free chocolate pieces, mochi, colored mochi, every crushed up candy bar you can imagine, lots of fruits, 4-5 different syrups, gummy bears, gummy worms, sour gummy twizzlers, gigantic marshmallows, and whipped cream.  There were many more things, but I can't quite remember them all.  It was the largest selection I've seen, but I'm pretty new to AZ and haven't had experience with that many frozen yogurt shops.  The employees were really helpful.  Everything was spotlessly clean, and the yogurt was really great.  We will be back.I've been to NAGA twice now.  The first time I saw that it was on Horizon Ridge and because I'm geographically challenged I assumed that meant it was close to the area I'm familiar with near Eastern, Green Valley Parkway, etc.   It's not.  It's way east, near the Henderson Campus of CSN.   The 2nd time I had to work at the aforementioned Henderson Campus so it was a no brainer to go back for lunch as I find the majority of options in that area offend my delicate palate.

The food here is VERY good.  The first time I did a Tom Yum soup with Shrimp, and found it to be a nice version of the dish.  I liked the touch of them removing the lime leaves prior to serving to save me from that extra step (my laziness continues to show no bounds)  I also tried the NAGA salad with beef, which I found to be very similar to most restaurants' versions of a simple Thai Beef Salad.   The ingredients were fresh and everything tasted nice.    The 2nd visit I tried the Basil lunch special with pork.   Again the ingredients were fresh and everything tasted great.  The pleasant surprise was that the lunch special came with a little salad and a cup of lovely creamed corn soup.  Anyone who knows me knows I tend to hate salads, but this salad had several of those wonton crisp strip thingies that I adore so much which raised the bar considerably.  

Service has been nice both times (once dine in and once take out), but I did find it a little slow each time.  My biggest complaint though would be on the spice levels, as they ask for it out of 4.   I can't tell you how much I hate spicy scale levels not out of 10.  I like a 7 or 8 out of 10, and always find that a 4/4 is too spicy and a 3/4 is not spicy enough, and I never feel like restaurants take decimals or fractions seriously.   Do I really think they'll write down 3.67 to give to the chef making the meal?  No.  

The lunch specials are nicely priced at about $8.   I also ordered a "Fresh Lemonade" because I cannot resist it on any menu.  It cost $3 and while tasty, I felt the size didn't match the price charged.   

All in all, you should consider NAGA if you're ever in the dining hell that is east east Henderson or if you're tired of the other 523 Thai restaurants you can choose from.Artifice is a lovely spot for a drink in the downtown area. It is located behind The Arts Factory off 1st Street and Charleston. It is a large space, which looks like it could have been a warehouse in the past. The ceilings are large, the flooring is wood. It is very open when you walk in, which is a very different experience from most Vegas bars which tend to make you feel cramped.

The bartenders are friendly and the people hanging out here are nice. I had a few really good conversations with the people sitting around me drinking. 

As I was leaving it sounded like a band was setting up to play. A little local music is happening here too. I will be making return trips.We enjoyed our visit to Umami. We went late last night. It was nice to find a place that servs food after 9:00pm. The service was fantastic! We love the dumplings...YUM! However, I must agree with other comments. The ramen was bland and wasn't hot. I like my soup hot :( The outside seating was nice. We will try Umami again.We finally have a honky-tonk to dance at. CM is making a comeback. Thursday night is particularly good. There is a free dance lesson at 7 pm and open dancing after that. No cover charge either! I stayed until almost 11 and there were still people dancing. It's real partner dancing too -- not that perversion from the 1960's that most people do because they don't know how to dance. The music selection is good with a variety of dance styles that can be done -- everything from chacha, waltz, swing, 2-step etc.

24 oz draft beers are $6.25 and they have a good selection. I had a satisfying Four Peak Oatmeal stout.Came back for lunch with a friend and I think lunch may be a better deal than dinner.  I ordered the sashimi bento box.  It came with a total of 6 pcs of skimpy slices of fish (salmon, tuna, and hamachi) over a bowl of ice, miso soup, salad, bowl of rice, and shrimp and veggie tempura, all for $10.95. 

The food came out pretty quick and there are many varieties of bento box that will please everyone.

Would I come back for lunch?  Yes.He looked so cute.  They had sooooo much they had to do.Loved the atmosphere and the fact that the show is right in front of you!  Worth the money spent. As with a couple of other shows we went to in Vegas be aware no bathrooms, so go before!Show is absolutely fantastic. Great show & great skits.. highly recommended. Only suggestion I would def. Give is to purchase the upgraded seats for the additional $25.. trust me you'll be glad you did... If your the type to get offended by swears and vulgarity this show might not be for you... def. Made for 18+.. Alot of funny sexual contents...Went for my birthday and loved it! Was cracking up the entire time, but I have a pretty liberal (childish?) sense of humor. As said by others, definitely not for uppity types or anyone offended by over-the-top racial and sexual humor. Glad I was not sitting toward the front though, because I also embarrass easily and would not have wanted to be picked on. TIP: if you're shy, you might want to ask to opt out of the first 3 or 4 rows. They will harass you and even pulled people up for a lap dance competition!

Aside from the humor, the circus acts were breathtaking. Being in such a small venue made it feel intimate and dangerous. The performers were just as, if not more talented than anyone you'll see in a big name circus, and here they're performing a few feet above your head. And with most being scantily clad, it was two shows in one :)

My only complaint is that we had a somewhat obstructed view. You're told that there are "no bad seats," but if you get a seat at the end of the row you will be right next to a tent support. We could see center stage fine, but had to lean over each other to see Penny at the front, who was the funniest part. Also, not that its a huge deal, but from the show description we were expecting some topless acts. Show has one girl in pasties, a few more in bras, but that's it. We had to sign an acknowledgement of "nudity" when we bought the tickets, so were a little disappointed there wasn't any. 

HELPFUL TIP: If you have to pick up your tickets at the box office, Absinthe has their own right next to the performance tent. We were not told this, so went to the inside box office at Caesar's Palace first. Then had a hefty walk outside to a whole different part of the casino, and hefty walk back... gave me a blister and made us late for dinner reservations!Everything was pretty good. Garlic tuna tasted like Garlic had nothing to do with it. Our server was good. Heard a couple bad stories about a rude server there, whatever. The hostess was ok.some of the best cocktails in phoenix. food is delicious but not intimidating.Stopped in again on the weekend. The place is busy as usual and service was a little slow, although it looked like the staff was working their butts off. We moved to the bar where we find we get a little faster service. Had some nice cocktails and ordered a sandwich. Just about when we decided that they must have lost our order, a staff member came out and told us we would be "comp" because they lost our order and our sandwich would be right out. WOW, how is that for customer service? We didn't expect to eat free, we could see they were busy and hey s__t happens. We would have been happy enough with were sorry we will get it out. Anyway it was very very nice of them. The sandwich was so good too. YUM, plus I love the chips. 
Thanks Windsor you turned that around very nicely.Overpriced, but what else do you expect in Vegas?

We got a specialty buffalo chicken pizza and side Caesar salad for about $10. I think the slice by itself would have been almost $7, so you might as well get the salad if you're splitting the slice.

The salad was over-dressinged, but the pizza itself was good. You can probably ask the guy to put less dressing in the salad.

Recommended over the pretzel stand across from it, where you see sad, wilted little pretzel pieces (but which smells heavenly). Also, much MUCH better than the pizza place downstairs.Homemade Chinese food!  Love it.  In a random strip mall in a totally unassuming area, but the place is very clean, food authentic and when we were there the ladies were making homemade dumplings right by our table.  I liked the dumplings, eggplant, and the noodles.  I'll be back again.Great little place to eat with great food and kind service. Treat yourself to a night out dinning here.When the words "Steak Bomb" flowed through my ear hole, I knew that I had to get one. Just seeing these two words together gave me the impression that it is not a food that plays games. This is a delicious concoction created to destroy hunger in a single blow.

Meet, East Coast Eats, a fairly new eatery bringing some of America's northeast flavors to Vegas. It was they who introduced me to the steak bomb, a New England twist to the more familiar Philly Cheesesteak. It's a mountain of thinly sliced beef, green peppers, onions and American cheese compressed into submarine roll. Yes, it was tasty. Yes, it was a heavy eat. And yes, I do have cravings for more throughout my day-to-day life.

East Coast Eats also does offer a pretty extensive menu, along with weekly specials, ranging from pizza to their signature Boston roast beef sandwiches.

 After that steak bomb, I did not have enough fight in me to sample anything else. But believe me, I will be back for round 2.We were greeted by the owners as soon as we came in. Very clean place. It didn't have that nasty dirty water smell either. The owners came to check on us while we ate. Had a very homey atmosphere.Honestly best all vegan restaurant I have been to. The wait can be very long just simply because there are so many returning customers. Only suggestion in the future  is I hope you guys expand one day to fill all your awesome customers with your wonderful food.Double Helix is a great place, relaxed low key most of the time and can also get pretty loud as the night goes on. The bartender was great and friendly.Food was good. Would definitely go back, and try some of their other sandwiches. Pretty cool that I live close too.Went at opening on Sunday and was the first one there. Great easy location with plenty of parking. Friendly greeting and exceptionally nice staff. Iced tea and Gyoza to start. They were light and hot. Very tasty. Next  came the Grilled Tiger Shrimp Mango Salad. Enough for three to four people and super delicious. The lime dressing was outstanding. FRESH and lovely with mint and ripe mango. Massaman curry with chicken and basmati rice. It was mild and I wish that I had asked for it hotter. All in all a delightful meal and plenty of left overs for a couple days. Will definitely go back. Looking forward to their Pad Thai and Filet Mignon PHO. When I left the restaurant was filling up with an Asian clientele. Always a good sign!Love this bakery always get my lemon bars from here and banana cream pie,soooooo yummy if you go to their website they make the most awesome cakes you need to come check this place out and it is family owned and operated so I definitely support small family business. Happy eating xoxoxLooking to get away from Las Vegas for just a moment?  In my opinion, Tivoli Village is one of the few places where you can completely forget that you're in the valley of sin.  Tivoli Village isn't necessarily a hot spot in Las Vegas, but it's definitely a luxurious and classy mini-town that should not be overlooked.  Filled with small shops, boutiques, restaurants, and even business offices (upstairs), Tivoli Village to me has always been a perfect place to take a stroll with good company.  On the westside of Tivoli Village is a handful of chairs and tables where I feel is the best spot in regards to people watching, relaxing, or to finish that great conversation you're having with someone.  After kicking back for awhile, you can then stroll towards the center where sometimes a live band is performing.  It doesn't cost anything to have a great time at Tivoli Village. All it cost is your time, which doesn't mean much when you're under all the beauty and lights that Tivoli Village has to offer. 

TIP:  Daytime serves this place no justice.  If you visit, do it at night when the lights shine bright like a diamond. Absolutely beautiful!!This is gluten free heaven! My friend introduced me to this place and I am always hesitant to try new foods when I am unfamiliar with the ingredients and when there is a possibility there could be a translation problem that I need to be wheat free! I checked out the menu online and saw I could order a plate, then I noticed gluten free on the website and I cheered, I can eat a sandwich!

I ordered the wood fired beef, plantains and the lime with cane sugar drink and it was absolutely delicious! They give you sauces to add to the sandwiches that was fabulous, the plantains were yummy as well as the drink it went perfect together. I look forward to trying the other meats they offer.

There is a patio outside however there are no misters so it could be a little warm during the day but for a summer night it will work! That area of the Strip is a little dicey but it is part of the charm!Always happy to see a new restaurant serving Mexican food that's good, clean, fast & cost effective, Salsa Blanca met all my requirements on the first visit. 
Had the Cheese Enchilada combo with green sauce. I thought they were the best I've had in forever. I'm used to getting enchiladas with overly cooked corn tortillas; not here, the corn tortillas were cooked to perfection and the green sauce was super tasty.
I held the last star back because the refried beans, as another Yelper mentioned, tasted like they recently resided in a tin can and the Spanish rice could have had a bit more spiciness. 
Overall, I really liked it and will be back, sooner rather than later.I like this place for an obvious reason, and a somewhat less obvious reason.

More obviously, I like their drinks. Although I haven't had a ton of experience with their coffee, I have had their smoothies and lemonades more than enough times. I approve. They seem freshly made (aside from when you simply watch the make stuff fresh) and not overly sweet.

The pastries on display... skip them. They are on the bottom end of mediocre. This is a real shame. I don't know much about their sandwiches/wraps/salads.

A little less obviously, I like the outdoor seating area an unusual amount. It genuinely reminds me of an actual French cafe I've been to... in France. Except in France the tables only seat 2, are jammed together, and drinks are served in 8oz glasses and carafes. These factors I do not miss. 

I recommend getting their lemonades. Especially when it's hot. With some mint (which they offer) they are a great way to cool down and enjoy a stroll around the rest of Tivoli Village.Their Porkchop, with rice, and egg on top, salad and extra dipping sauce is BOMB! I always order here for Take Out. Never dined in. I give this place 4 stars because previously, when I ordered here in the past, it took them ALMOST a whole hour of waiting to deliver the food to my house. I was disappointed, but I didn't expect to wait that long, for delivery, regardless if it was crazy/busy that day. By far, it's a good spot for Vietnamese food! Mmmmm..mmmm.First of all

I am not a big fan of sandwiches or american cuisine.

Having said that I love the bobby, the bread was delicious and the combination of toppings inside the sandwich will lead to mouth orgasms. 

The cheesesteak was ordinary. 

Get the bobby, its what sets them apart from the rest :)Went back a second time...much better.  I also went back when it wasn't so busy (Saturday ~11:30).  I got the Grilled Chicken Sandwich.  It was cooked just right and the Zucchini Chips were really good (nice breading and crispy - tasty dipping sauce).Wow....I am an addict of H&J now.  To be honest I didn't think H&J would be better than Boiling Crab but holy moly it sure was way better.  Less oily but still very buttery delicious and flavorful! Thank youOm om om... The only reason I did not give them 5 stars due to price and limited seating. But anyway, back to taco love land.. Amaz.. yes indeed. As you wait in your line of choice (each line has a designated list you can choose from of meats). You can order quesadillas, mullas, tacos, vampiros... with any meat of choice depending on your line of choice. As you wait you will notice fresh corn tortillas are being made and the meat sizzling on the burning grill. As you order you place your order with the man that chops the meat on the block and preps your order to your liking in a matter of seconds. If you ask for the everything you will get cilantro, chopped onions, salsa and guacamole.. mmmhmmm. You place your order on your tray and then walk over to the cashier, who they makes the count and charges your per item. She also is in charge of drinks, and if you want extra salsa (free) you request from her. As you head for the door to eat, don't forget to grab your limes, radishes and salt or pepper. As I mentioned earlier, depending on the time of day, you might not be able to find seating. THis is located in an older center north of the Wynn hotel, right next to some souvenir store. Definitely on my list of stops when in Vegas.It was very good. Little bit of a language barrier thought. So don't think you can change your order from what's on the menu. Unless you speak Vietnamese.great service! The noodles are hand pulled. I would recommend general tso's chicken also of you aren't into eating noodles. Quality is great, service
Fast, and prices are low. 

Don't underestimate this place.I'm so happy that this Five Guys opened here!

Five Guys is a great place to get a burger. The base is a delicious patty, spiced and cooked with good flavor, inside of a hamburger bun. From there, you can choose an array or toppings or none at all. Once you order, you wait until your number is called and you go get your food.

It can be pretty heavy, so it's not a frequent meal I partake it, but when I do I enjoy it very much so. The Cajun fry's are delicious. There is no reason to order anything other than a small. They give you a cup-full inside of the bag on top of your regular order.Had lunch here today. The salad I had was crisp and fresh. The chicken had a great taste. The portions were very good. 
The place was clean. The service was fine. 
For fast food and selection we will be back.The big greasy bag of fries may make you wince at first...but let me tell ya they're pretty damn good!

Good, fresh burgers and fries.  A TON of fries.  Really, I don't NEED all those fries!  But I'll eat them.  Oh yes, I will.  The only thing that would make this place better?  A drive-thru!  But really, I don't need that either. Getting out of my car and walking inside ...ah yes, what a grueling workout!I'm going to have to go back to add to this one, but I want to spend every weekend here!  I just wish I'd brought boots that were made for walking (or dancing).

I stopped in on New Year's Ever for last call expecting a nightmare of a crowd, and after the hilarious bouncer allowed us inside, I heard the most amazing drum and bass coming from the back room.  I was immediately transported back to the late 90's when I enjoyed many a night in an abandoned Phoenix warehouse listening to local DJs spinning House, DnB and whatever other variety was happening at the time.  The crowd was mixed and accommodating and the bartenders knowledgeable.  

Can't wait to go back with my dancing shoes!

PS - did I mention the DJ was actually spinning vinyl?  THANK YOU!I've been here twice now and this place is as cute and fresh as it can be. First visit I had the eggs benedict with potatoes. The eggs benny were delicious, the orange juice was fresh and cold, but the potatoes were average. Second visit I had the pear omelette and a little bran muffin. That may not sound good to some, but this was absolutely delicious. Great taste and presentation. The service is very friendly here and though it's crowded, it's super-clean. I wouldn't hesitate to visit again. Might skip the potatoes though.Parents, if you have kids that throw temper tantrums because they want a particuar toy, and they want it NOW, don't bring them here. this store is geared for the serious collector. For people who grew up during the 60's through the 90's, you'll be familiar with the majority of stuff here- Barbie, diecast cars, Star Wars, Transformers, GI JOE, Masters of the Universe, Marvel Superheroes, LOTR, McFarlane, Simpsons, and many, many more...

a few of these items doubled, tripled, or more in price over time due to their popularity,
so be prepared to pay or try your luck to make an offer, if you are looking to purchase something here. My favorites here are the vintage Transformers and Star Wars sections. Growing up in Hawaii, I'm also a fan of Japanese Superheroes plastic vinyl and diecast figures(Kikaida, Gorangers, Rainbowman, Kamen Rider, Zaboga, Ultraman, etc. but sadly nothing like that found here. The Shogun Warriors Godzilla was pretty cool though. 

I'll continue to pop in every once in a while, because its all about the thrill of the hunt, and I may find something to add to my action figure collection...ALOHA!!!In a land locked city such as Madison, there's reason to be skeptical of oysters.  But that said, the martinis served were iced to perfection, the oysters were delightful and offered a few varieties I'd not had before, loved the selection and the help from the staff.  Tried the scallops with a perfect sear and a fantastic bacon and apple bit sauce.  The decor is unique and feels hip and quaint at the same time.  Will be back to try more of the menu.Good food. Nice waitstaff. Great tea. Service is a little slow, but the pita is amazing.The gf and I continue to search for our "go to " places in the neighborhood.  In that this is basically the only Chinese place less than a mile from the homestead and they deliver, we walk in with fingers crossed.

ordered

Hot/Sour soup (bowl- $5)
BBQ Pork ( $7)
honey walnut shrimp ( $12)

gf orders her "good girl" chicken and steamed veggies ( I believe cost for both under $12)

The soup was decent and a decent serving.  The pork was also a generous serving and we believe it was the pork loin so a good cut of meat.  I enjoyed the shrimp more than she did - we agreed it was above average.

gf was very happy that the chicken/veggies were properly prepared.  unfortunately, she tasted the honey shrimp and pork and that opened the flood gates !  The chicken and veggies were quickly placed in a to-go container and the girlfriend orders the citrus beef ( I think that's what it's called - cost less than $10) and it's over - she wolved most of that down ( btw - we agreed that was our fav dish of the night ) 

I'm stuffed but again, the gf just warming up - she decides we need  dessert ( the only item I finally got around to taking a picture of ) Banana/nutella egg roll with ice cream (we picked red bean ) - very good !  

Service was timely and attentive, then again, a little worried that we were the only people there at 7:30 pm on a Friday ( they did have several to-go orders while there ) 

Overall, we were very please and will consider this our local Chinese spot.

one picGreat service...quality food....family friendly atmosphere.:)I'm updating my review and giving Panda two more stars for their additional of more shrimp dishes on the menu!  I've been getting the Panda Bowl with Peppercorn Shrimp lately - and I have to admit, it's pretty tasty. Like the fact that this dish is made with asparagus as the main veggie ingredient along with the shrimp. More please!Good hotdogs with an awesome twist. I just had an angry dog, topped with spicy bulgogi, Asian slaw, jalape√±os, and spicy mayo. Seriously one of the best hotdogs I've ever had and definitely the most unique.Always have liked this place... Portions are HUGE! Each plate had a tree of rosemary skewering it. The honey buttermilk busicuits are to die for. My friends said their pot pie was a little bland... But it came with a huge hat shaped pie crust and that mostly made up for it.I've had many many many good experiences here... The only reason they got 4 stars is they have messed my order up several times but always very quick to fix! ( I get the patty melt which is sour dough and Swiss but I switch to Texas toast and provolone as Swiss doesn't sit right with me) other than that always nice staff and always fast service (does slow it down when they make it wrong but it's well worth the wait) I would get a concrete every visit if the small wasn't so expensive .. So sadly I do not get it often! 

In any case love this place!!!!I don't know if it's a blessing or curse that I live far from Bread and Butter. It's a blessing because I definitely don't need the extra calories and curse because it's so damn GOOD!

I only got a chance to go here for take-out and got a red velvet bagel. Anyone who knows me knows that I'm a sucker for anything red velvet. I got it toasted with cream cheese and it was melt-in-your-mouth delicious. I loved the chocolate chips that were semi-melted because I got it toasted.

I'm dying to go back here again and try even more of their menu. One thing that irked me a bit was their service was a little unorganized. The cashier didn't have enough change for me so she took out all of the tips from the tip jar and dropped it all over the floor. And she asked me three times if I wanted my bagel toasted. I get it... it was busy. They may want to train their staff a little better because this place won't be slowing down anytime soon!Good beers; food menu leaves something to be desiredThe patio; enough said! It's big with a fire pit and shade trees too. The food is yummy and priced pretty well - parking is limited.The restaurant is in a great location and is easily accessible by the foot traffic that downtown Las Vegas sees around Fremont street..

We went there around 9 pm on a Tuesday evening.. The restaurant was quite packed.. We decided to sit in the patio. They had the heaters going which was nice..

We ordered the following vegan dishes. The lady who was waiting us was very forthcoming and told us exactly which items were vegan and the new that were not..

1. Drunken noodles - we ordered spicy 4 out of 5 and it was a really tasty and flavorful.
2. Masamam curry - we ordered spicy 4 out of 5.. They had a lot of curry sauce and vegetables in the dish.. It was really flavorful and tasty as well,, 

They served us  brown rice on request. 

All in all a great experience! Will definitely go back to Le Thai restaurant again. 

Ps: right around 10 pm the neighborhood bar starts playing loud music. If you are out in the patio, you will not to be able to hear anything else but the loud music.  Be prepared with ear plugs.. Alternatively, walk inside to the inside room if the music bothers you..Yup, this place is good.  Great wait staff and great food.  Just go and enjoy!The turkey, cranberry and stuffing sandwich is amazing.Marissa is awesome!  Food was not the most authentic I've had but the atmosphere and service were fabulous.  I'll be back, I'll just away from the lobster bisque.You need some sausage on the West Side?  Bison Jacks will provide.

Seems like they're still working some of the kinks out on the assembly line service, but I'm confident they are going to improve on that based on the positive energy I saw from the staff.

It's primarily a  hot dog shop, where you can order pre-built dogs (bison, chicago, cajun, brats, chili, and others) or build your own.  It's the build your own that seems the most fun.  They also have a couple burger choices.

Pick a roll, sausage, toppings, and a side if you need it, and you're good to go.

We ordered a Chicago Dog, a "build your own" bison dog, and I grabbed an andouille on their Dark Squaw (think pumpernickel) bun with roasted red and green peppers.

Super tasty, but a bit pricey as well.  Frankly (pun intended) the quality of the ingredients seem to justify it.  My only complaint was there seemed to be some confusion on when you ordered a side - if it belonged on a specific order or if it came in it's own container.  Seems like a minor thing, but when you're doing take out, $3 for some fries next to your dog is memorable.  The fries were great, but maybe they need to be more clear on what a side means.

4 out of 5, because they need to iron out some things, but I'm super happy we have a Chicago-worthy dog joint on the West Side.

Next time I'd probably sit down for the meal instead of takeout, as I don't think the 15 min drive back did the dogs justice.

(edited for grammar)My Indian co-workers and friends swore by this place, and it really is pretty good. 

I should educate myself on the varieties of food served, but the things that resembled crepes were really good. And that stuff that looks like spinach. Oh, and the spicy potatoes. It was a very filling and delicious lunch!

Anyway, between this and Udupi Cafe (don't let my ignorance of the names of the cuisine convince you that I don't know what I like. I just don't know what to call it), I think Udupi serves up the hotter and spicier entrees, while this one served dishes I hadn't experienced before.

I'd return, and next time will probably take notes. Or pictures. Or something.The food here is great and this is a staple restraint when me and my wife visit Phoenix . The south Indian food is yummy. They have some consistency unissued with the salt but overall great food every time.Went for breakfast this morning and had an omelette, I thought that it was good. The staff there is very friendly and helpful, that really goes a long way for me. I will be supporting this local business, I look forward to going back for lunch or dinner and trying one of the pasta dishes and the in house made cheesecakeI've had Luigis now about ten times in the last year and I must say, I'm a fan. I've only had it for carry out so I can't speak of the table service. 

I truly believe that Luigis makes some of the best pizza in Madison, without a doubt! It's not Neapolitan and it doesn't pretend to be. However, it does sort of on the surface maybe a little bit resemble neapolitan pizza but with a real midwestern twist.

The pizza has been somewhat inconsistant over the last year (mainly in the first few months)  but I feel they've worked out all the kinks.

If you live on the near west side then I highly recommend calling ahead and picking up a double cheese (thick) baddabing to go, with a side of spinach and artichoke dip. Order doughnuts with dipping marinara as well, they make for a great little side.

I don't think I would be sitting down for dinner since I can't have a rum drink here. 

Either way, It's a great addition to the neighborhood.Really enjoy this place a lot. Great atmosphere, and it is clean, clean, clean. The food is good and the service is okay at times. Great to come during lunch because its not so busy.Great food! Great Service! 
My wife and I went there for happy hour and ended up liking the food so much we just continued to order plates. All the food was fantastic and was brought out to our specifications. (Sometimes we can be a little picky how we order certain dishes.)
Drinks were decently priced. My wife's vodka cranberry was literally overflowing with ice, so make sure you ask for no ice.
Other then that one thing... We loved and would definitely go back for some more.So I was trying to get into this place. But there was a limit on the number of people allowed here since the last soccer game was on. The lady was a bit snippy in the way she turned customers down. She could've been more friendly. My friends already had a table reserved with 2 empty seats waiting for us. Finally after talking to the manager and having to show him the 2 empty reserved seats, we got to enjoy the ambiance. 

The place looks inviting. The server made up for the poor introduction to the place. The server was excellent- friendly, quick, and responsive! Thank you! Then I had hot coffee with a warm blackberry cobbler. I thought I was going to get a slice, but I was pleasantly surprised with a cute individual mini pie. It was sooo good!I was of course excited to see that a new breakfast place opened up. I'm a sucker for breakfast foods - and am still trying to find the best Chicken Fried Steak in Vegas. 

I went here for breakfast a couple weeks ago - only one other table was occupied. That kind of got me worried, but I was excited nonetheless. The chicken fried steak was decent. Not the best I've ever had, but it wasn't the worst. The batter on it was thin, but a little soggy. The steak was a bit chewy but nothing that wasn't manageable. I had good flavor. The gravy was pretty good as well. I opted for the fruit cup instead of the hash browns - and the fruit seemed pretty fresh. 

All in all, a decent experience. The service was quick and good. It's definitely a place I would go back to for breakfast if I'm in the neighborhood. But, my quest to find the best chicken fried steak hasn't quite been satisfied yet.bun bo hue... yes it is pretty good here... kind of light on the spices but still delicious !I think I had a good time here. We were already a little tipsy when we got here, being drawn to the sound of live music.  I really can't complain about the $3 cover charge (it's Scottsdale after all) but it seemed like the band stopped just as we were settling in at the cool upstairs patio and they did not seem to play consistent sets from that point on.

In all fairness  the reasonably priced (and strong) vodka sodas may have affected my concept of time. The staff were friendly enough, the patrons not too terribly uppity and it was nice that the place was not packed and the aforementioned upstairs patio is a great vantage point to watch the hot messes on the street below. I'm sure it gets packed other times but I quiet enjoyed having my personal space and being able to chill.I recently received a Living Social deal to this place from my girlfriend. I'm a hard sell when it comes to a new barber shop. If I move to a new area and find a barber that I like, I'll stick with him/her until I move or they die. Add on the fact that Kenon R.'s recent review was less than flattering and I'm walking in a bit anxious. 

Thanks to Kenon's review I also knew to check in first with the barber section and not the bar. The friendly girl behind the counter asked what beer I'd like and then introduced me to my barber, Alex. Alex was a friendly guy, very personable, upbeat, and it turned out I was very pleased with my haircut! What a relief! I usually just go with Great Clips, so when I got a straight razor shave on my neck and around my ears after my haircut I was pretty surprised. I dug that. Believe it or not, I think I'm sold on this place and I might come back. It is $20 for a haircut and $2 for a beer. Next time I'll just skip the beer and get the haircut. The beer is a nice touch, but not necessary. Maybe it was just what I needed on this first visit to take the edge off.

One last thing. Before I went I was always wondering if hair would end up in my beer. Well, they give you the beer with a shot glass on top so it covers the bottle neck, thus avoiding a hairy beer. Nice.Granted it was busy that day, but they ran out of hamburgers! The salad and the service were very good.My wife and I both ordered specialty drinks from the menu and while they both had a good taste, they both tasted watered down. Perhaps the ice temp was high and caused them to dilute quickly. Who knows. But in Vegas when you spend money on drinks they are usually spot on. We ate in the bar and both also ordered the pub burger. It was very good. Cooked perfectly and well crafted.Try the Fish Fry

I'm from Milwaukee, WI.  Land of the Friday Night Fish Fry.  My idea of the perfect fish fry is beer battered, potato pancakes w/applesauce, cole slaw and a salted caraway snack rye bread or roll.  

Last Lenten season we tried a new place every Friday looking for anything that came close to what I love in Milwaukee.  No dice.  Chompie's for example had a good potato pancake, but the fish batter wasn't very good, cole slaw was blah and the bread was wrong (and it was like $12/$13, pricey for fish fry).

Last Friday I tried the Fish Fry at Culver's and it was good.  Ok, it didn't have the potato pancakes and the bread was wrong, but the fish and cole slaw was really tasty.  I liked the french frys and would deal with the dinner roll vs. rye bread.

Great value and quality fish fry.  I'm saving my 5 stars for the ultimate, throw down, it's just like home fish fry.

My only complaint about Culver's (besides Pepsi products, yuck) is that they have built this location close enough to my home that my girlish figure will surely suffer.   Haven't  started checking flavor of the day forecasts yet but summer will be here soon enough.As long time friends & fans of Barrio Cafe, my husband and I were anxious to determine whether the downer reviews of BQ were for real...It's hard to believe that Silvana would allow her name and work to be compromised. Alas, after our visit today at lunch, we were very relieved to enjoy a very nice meal that represented Silvana well. We ordered three wonderful tacos (fish, chicken y chorizo, and shrimp), chile verde, a mole tamale (the mole was AWESOME) and some very tasty guacamole. My husband is a chile verde connoisseur (which means he eats it a LOT) and said the flavors were rich and complex, and better than traditional chile verde. The black beans that came with his chile verde were *clearly* made from scratch, with an unmistakably homemade flavor.  I have yet to determine if we are salt deprived or if restaurants in general err on the side of less salt -- it is a matter of personal taste -- and with a couple of dashes of salt, the flavors of our meal delighted us. 

For full disclosure, we did not have any alcoholic beverages (loved the water with thick, juicy lemon slices...mmm!)  and found that the price of lunch was very reasonable, considering our "full" factor when we were finished. My husband and I had been to this location when it was a French bistro (which I really did not like, mostly because of the ambience/layout of the restaurant) but Silvana has done a fantastic job of creating a fun, stylish, and festive atmosphere. I'm looking forward to visiting again!

PS As for the naysayers like Jordan -- who I believe sat behind us at lunch (the guy bitching about the size of the tacos before he even ordered one?) -- sometimes people just bring their unhappiness with them wherever they go...If you want a "big" taco for $2, Taco Bell awaits you...Very good neighborhood rest! Very attentive server and mgr walked around and checked in on the customers. Loved the ambiance. If we were there sans kids, would have sit at bar and ate. Tv's and patio. I had the fish-delicious, French fries and side salad yum. My Hubbie said ribs ok but he thinks he makes the best ribs. The beans that came with the ribs, everyone enjoyed! Would go back to try something else!Very good pizza slices.Located near The Cracked Egg and Tea Time; Upon arriving I believe the owner of the place who was very friendly and helpful. He explained how the menu works, he said the tacos were very popular with the Al Pastor meat. The Costras is what caught my eyes, I didn't know what it was but it sounded good. I ordered the Costras with Al Pastor meat which is a bed of tortilla topped with marinated meat and layered with mozzarella cheese, topped with their salsa. The salsa was really good, it was their own recipe which had pineapples in it. Definitely a must try! I also ordered a tres leche cake to go...the cake was delicious and it was only $3.00.The wait was plain ridiculous at the original location so we decided to go to this secondary location where I called ahead and there was no wait and close to other errands we were doing. I don't like this temporary new earlier schedule of ours. Having breakfast at breakfast time really sucks with the wait times and dampens the mood.

We had zippys chili omelette on the specials white board. It's pretty decent and a bit different. I never really thought about chili on eggs, but it makes sense. 

I did a make your own skillet - potatoes with your choice of toppings (1 meat, 2 veggies, 1 cheese) and you can add additional toppings to the base price. I did carnitas, peppers, onions, pepper jack cheese and asked for green sauce on the side. It was decent, but different from most skillets that seem cooked together, this is more thrown on top and put in the broiler to melt the cheese. 

We got our babystacks that come with our breakfast upgraded to their two new flavors on the white board. We did butterfinger which was rather nice and the butter finger pieces slightly melted were more peanutty in flavor and some parts crunchy. The creamsicle was decent, but I don't know if I'm just not a fan of orange flavored baked goods. 

Service was alright. It took a while for someone to come see us and order but once we did food came out pretty quickly . Server and host were both friendly. 

Yep. Same consistency of food as the original which is good. Sometimes it doesn't happen that way with new locations. Same food with possibly less of a wait!We went here for dinner last night for the first time-- well, the last time it was Bloom :).  Salmon and the Ahi Tuna and a side of mashed potatoes. The salmon was really delicious, crispy on top and tender in the middle. It came with barbecued lentils and our waitress said they tasted just like potato chips. I don't know what she meant by that.. they tasted like barbecued lentils to me. Anyway, it was a lot of fun. I like the atmosphere in there. And, if like me you can't stomach paying more than $30 a bottle, they have a few for $25 which just feels better!Came here for a quick Chinese good fix and the food was surprisingly good!  It's hard to get authentic Chinese food inside a casino, and I have to say this one meets the standard.  

As for the service, most people here were pretty nice.  However, maybe because they are fairly new, the speed is still kind of slow and it does seem kind of chaotic sometimes.

I like it overall and will definitely come back!Decided to check this spot out with a group of friends on Saturday and what a cool little bar! It's super tiny, like you could drive past it in a nano-second. The interior decorations are pretty sweet. They have this like wood wallpaper all around the place, super man-cave worthy. They have tons of silly named drinks on the menu, but I stuck with beer. The bar is super small, but the service was great and the people watching even better. it's a cool spot to jsut catch a drink and not worry about the outside world for a bit. All in all, cool little bar that I'm sure I'll make my way back to when I'm in the area.Great hidden gem!  Went there last night for dinner and was very impressed!  The zucchini was egg was amazing as well as the sausage pasta with the cauliflower.  Sounds like a crazy combination but was amazing!  Go check it out!I think I am sort of at a 3.5 for this review. I got a small mocha and a bagel plain, in the bag and my total was over $6.00 which seemed high. The vibe in the coffeehouse was really awesome and they were pretty busy which I was happy to see. I just thought it was a little spendy. The mocha was very good and the service was friendly.Great burgers............great view.I went here on a Saturday afternoon, with my sis-in-law, my one year old nephew and her friend.  Admission was 10 bucks for locals...  I am fascinated with the mob/organized crime families..They have exhibits featuring all the major crime families, their sphere of infulence.  Oscar Goodman has a small section, our beloved mayor was an attorney for the mob..I had a client, an elderly lady that was in her 80s.. She would tell me stories how she would have mob family meetings in her home in MT Charleston... Two movies that are a favorite  are casino and goodfellas... You notice Joe Pesci, gets whacked in both films.. Well anyhow, i went thru the  entire museum stopping at all the exhibits.. 
I spent a good 3 hrs in here and could of spent more time, if it werent for a near 2 year old year old trying to get into the exhibits...Its not a big museum but it is packed with interesting displays. I reccommend this for anyone that is interested in this genre... Camera friendly place.. Hope this yelpsSOL is one of our favorite casual restaurants in the Scottsdale Quarter shopping area.  It's located on the North end of the Quarter, so I recommend parking in the North Garage.  

They're known for their Tacos...and they deliver the goods!  Some of the menu items I've had here are:

Naked Guacamole (Hass Avocado, Cilantro, Lime, Onion, Serrano, Tomato), $8.75

Chorizo and Mushrooms con Queso (Chorizo, Mushrooms, 3 Mexican Cheeses, Serrano & Scallions), $12.50

Street Taco Flight (2 each Carne Asada, Carnitas, Chicken Tacos), $18

Vampiro Taco (Cheese, Serrano Chile, Scallions,  Carne Asada, Guacamole, Pico, Chipotle Sauce, Cotixa Cheese), $6.75

Taco Buffalada (Chicken, Carne Asada, Carnitas, Cheese, Onion, Guacamole, Pico, Radish), $6.50

3 Carne Asada Tacos, $14.50

3 Carnitas Tacos, $13.00

My favorite out of all of the Tacos is the Vampiro Taco.  It's full of flavor and has a unique taste to it.  The Buffalada Taco is a close second....although I think mixing all of those Meats together on one Taco is a bit much.  Their traditional street Tacos (Carne Asada/Carnitas) are very good, but I prefer eating those from a hole in the wall Mexican restaurant.

Their appetizers are very good too.  The Naked Guacamole is amazing, so is the Chorizo and Mushrooms con Queso.  Those two can fill you up though, so don't order too much food if you decide to go with one of those apps.

The service here is so/so.  When it gets busy, the attentiveness of the servers declines....and this place gets very busy, especially at dinner time and happy hour.  Whenever it's busy, we have to wave down our servers to keep our glasses full, order more Wine, etc.

The vibe here is pretty cool too.  When the weather is great, the patio is a nice place to be.  However, when it gets hot and the misters turn on, it can be a bit too much.  The misters on the patio pump out a lot of water....too much in my opinion.  It's kind of funny because it looks like a tropical rainforest when they turn on the misters in the middle of the Summer heat....there's a massive "fog" and it can get you a bit soaked.  I joked about it with a bartender one night and he said that the misters are controlled by the shopping mall and not by the individual businesses, so they have no control over it.  Oh well, it makes for great people watching.

Return Factor - 95%Good food with good ambience.!! Located in the upscale Scottsdale Quarter Mall..  Things I tried was Roasted Corn with all the spices and herbs and their sweet potato and black bean taco. They have many vegetarian options.I can't comment on the dollar value of this experience, because we were lucky enough to score some free tickets and have no idea what the entrance fee is.  But it was truly an enjoyable experience.  We took another couple with us, visiting us from the east coast, and we all had a great time.

The support people - those running the shop, taking tickets, etc., were so friendly and fun, but the real fun started when we went inside.  I loved the interaction with some of the characters and, like some others have written, would have enjoyed more of it.  Nevertheless, it was really interesting to go through the parts of the exhibit that were more museum-like, and it was an artful presentation.  Personal memorabilia was interspersed with video and well-crafted life-like film vignettes.  

All in all, it was a great combination of Interesting and Fun.I drove by this place a few times and was curious about it. One night my girlfriend and I decided to celebrate the start of our vacation with All You Can Eat Sushi. She and I have been to many places all over Vegas for AYCE; and we have our standard favorites, so we were skeptical to try this "new" place out, especially because it does not look like a quality sushi place from its store front. To our delighted surprise, the sushi and variety were great. All though the service was a bit slow, the overall experience demands a return visit from us. It proves that great food takes time. There are a couple other sushi places for AYCE around town which are better; however, for its proximity to our home, customer service, and its family run ambiance, you can't beat it.What does a guy look for in a wing?  Crispy?  Yes.  Flavorful options?  Indeed.  Healthy size?  Sure.  Kool Aid on the side?  Why not?  Listen, the only reason ATL Wings isn't getting a 5th star today is the fact that we ordered them to go and then waited for 45 minutes.  I think they had a couple people call in sick, or something, but that's just too long to ask anyone to wait with all those smells punching you in the nose-hole.  

I tried the Mac n' Cheese bites, they were good.  The Honey Biscuits reminded me of mini-scones from the fair where I grew up in Idaho - MUST ORDER!  I will be back - but you better believe I'll call ahead with my order to avoid the wait.My kids love this place.
They're pretty consistent service and quality wise.
I think for a semi-fast food joint they are above avg. in service, and overall dining experience.  

We've tried most of the menu items and the burritos are a favorite. 
The place is clean and well kept, service is polite and pretty fast. 
The Gilbert Rd. location rarely has a long line or wait, except maybe weekday lunch hour.Great place to have a snack, relax and get some work done. Well worth the annual fee!This is one of the better fitness clubs in Phoenix. The variety, condition, and usability of the exercise equipment is quite good. The facility is usually fairly clean. Some of the equipment is out of adjustment however and management has trouble making the corrections even when repeatedly notified.With VERY little effort, LA Fitness could make this the best fitness center in the Valley of the Sun. With all this said, this club is the one I usually go to.I went on June 5 2013 with my girlfriend to celebrate her birthday. This is the second time that we have been there. The first time we love it, it was perfect the food and service superb. This time we went to have the beef Wellington , the signature dish, it was delicious but not  a 5 star dish. Also the service was not good at all. It is a very expensive place for the type of service we received that night. I hope this place changes for the better.I had 2 concretes made with the banana/vanilla swirl. It was very delicious and both of us enjoyed it. The service was extremely friendly, most importantly, and the place was clean!We loved the look of this place, the great, enthusiastic service from all the staff, and enjoyed the food, with the exception of the side of sauteed spinach, which was thick and gloppy. It was more like an appetizer spinach dip with cheese and bacon, but somehow the flavor was bland.  Loved the steak salad and beef stroganoff. We'll be back!Great small place. Friendly staff. Nice menu. Perfect for breakfast/brunch.I'd like to become a regular here. Especially at the bar. It's well stocked with good liquors and a big selection of Belgian and Belgian-style beers. The bartenders are friendly. The atmosphere is dark and rustic/charming. The patio is intimate with a nice fireplace and heaters with large comfy couches. The food is great, though it takes quite a long time for it to come out after you order it. My boyfriend and I had the burger- moist, perfectly cooked, and with great flavor. We also split the challah french toast. It was very good as well. This place is exactly what I'd like in a neighborhood bar.We love shopping at Winco.  This store has taken the place of Walmart which makes me happy because Walmart is an evil entity.  I love that they carry Tillamook products like cheese, ice cream and yogurt.  The produce is abundant and in good shape, but there are very few, if any organic options.  The prices are great on things like cereal that is usually 4 bucks a box.  Winco usually has it for $3.  I like that they give me a reusable bag discount for bringing my own bags.  Every store should encourage this type of behavior because plastic bags are so wasteful.  We have never bought their meat or seafood, so I can't speak on that, but everything else we've bought has been good quality at a fair price.Excellent service! Great sushi & they had a lot of specialties that you don't normally find at sushi bars. Great restaurant-looking forward to returning and enjoying some TapanI went here on my way to Hawaii. Here's the deal. This place has awesome breakfast sandwiches. They are way better than anything else you can get in the airport for breakfast at the current time. I had an egg sandwich on pizza crust....it was excellent! I liked that it was cooked by a person in a pan (although I did see all of their 'sauce's coming out of plastic bags for later in the day.....not so awesome, but what can I expect?). The pizza crust made for a tasty spin on this classic sandwich. It also had cheese and tomato. It came with italian home fries, which were delicious! They had garlic and parm on them...Seriously? What more can you ask for...especially in an airport!The coffee was fine. Not great, just fine.

The pastries, on the other hand, were a revelation. Some of the best croissants ever (chocolate--yum! almond--thank you!). 

The line is sloppy, it's all a bit overpriced (but it's in the Bellagio, so what do you expect?) but if you like pastry, for God's sake, don't miss it.Definitely it's my favorite spot great patisserie best quality you can get   
Coffee and ice cream it's the best I will go back for sure and I do recommend to everyoneCharming bakery and coffee shop,,, with a relaxing atmosphere and delectable desserts! Went to celebrate a birthday and tried several sweets: banana creme pie, strawberry rhubarb pie, peanut butter bar and triple choco mousse. We shared bites and all were delicious. The banana creme pie definitely has a unexpected twist and was not your typical pie. The crust is similar to a Napoleon... light, flaky and crispy and the insides are a creamy "bnanna" melt in your mouth custard, topped with ample whip creme, a caramel drizzle and choc shaving.The peanut butter bar and mousse were rich and chocolaty. The strawberry pie a traditional treat with fabulous crust. The staff was welcoming and friendly and more then willing to explain in detail choices. We came at 6:30pm and asked if they close promptly at 7pm, to make our decision to stay or go and the counter staff indicated they would stay as long as we needed. Can't ask for more then that!This is a wonderful new, little bakery. The menu and baked goods selection is still a bit limited (the only reason I didn't give them 5 stars). We had coffee, some of the Mac and Cheese with bacon (yummy but could have been served a bit warmer) and a really good mixed-berry pie al a mode  (which was really good). The setting was modern, urban and comfortable. I very nice little place.Spent the evening looking for some late night coffee and was about to give up when I decided to cross the street.  And boy am I glad I did.  
This little vegan restaurant was the answer to my quest. Located in what appears to be an old house converted into a restaurant/coffee shop in downtown Phoenix, this place has a bit of a beat nick ambiance. A fun throwback to my college days on The Hill in Boulder Colorado.  Once inside my desire for coffee quickly left me as I found out this place offered a home grown Thai iced tea. Opting for the almond milk was a great choice.  The tea was an explosion of ecstasy for my taste buds. Great flavor without too much sweetness.Went on a Thursday at lunch. Place was busy and it's not that big. Service started out a little slow, but our waiter fixed that by the end of the meal. The Chili con Fritos was a good start. All the burgers were good and the hot dog my daughter got was the best hot dog my wife had ever tasted. Overall a good place to go and get adventurous with your burger.I have not tried the food, but the bartenders are great and the service on the patio is good. They have great beer selection for a restaurant.

They also had a chalk board displaying what beers would be on tap next, which was a great way to lure me back!Staff is super friendly, sandwiches are fresh, the cookies are warm and the prices are fair! They deliver too which is even better!Oh Jimmy Johns, you chain sandwich place, why oh why do you have to be in my hood!!!! Your free smells entice me your fresh bread delights me, oh I could live on just your bread alone, but now your close to my house and will deliver sandwiches to me, is this heaven or hell!!!!  

Yep got me a Jimmy Johns right around the corner from my house now, and though I try to stay out of chain places, but I love love love me some Jimmy Johns!  My daughter and I were starving and didn't feel like making anything so she said lets order some sandwiches and have them delivered, I was like yea, let's see how Fast their Fast is! Ok we ordered 2 Beach clubs & BAM! at my place in less than 10 mins from time we ordered them!  

Sandwich was fresh and delish, and didn't disappoint!  Yep I'm a Jimmy Johns fan!I haven't had a patty melt in years! It was just as good as I remembered! Love the skinny fries and they have Dr. Pepper! Next time I'll bring my kids!Wow! Who knew airport Pozole could be so delicious!

We had half an hour to grab a bite before our next plane but didn't want to do fast food. The hostess said they were quick so we sat ourselves down and ordered margaritas and pozole. 

It took about 15 minutes to get our food and drinks - which is pretty quick for a sit-down type of place (but a little long for just soup!). The pozole was great! I really wasn't expecting much since we were at the airport, but I was really impressed! The margaritas were strong and definitely gave us a nice buzz for our flight home. 

Would definitely come here again if I find myself in the Phoenix Airport!Beer and wings. This is a place to go. Clean English style interior makes this place neat and cozy at the same time. Variety beer selection with daily promotion would attract beer lovers to this pub. 15 different wing flavors from buffalo to pineapple curry and huge wings definitely works for foodies like me. All you can eat wings for $12.99 on wednesday is worth to try all different flavors as many as you can. If you are looking for a place to escape from smokey bars in Las vegas, I highly encourage you to visit smoke-free and cozy Firkin on Paradise.Your Gyro yumminess

Hit this place up and was impressed by the fast service, tasty food, portion size, and nice owner.  

The gyro meat is very tender and is missing the nasty oiliness I've come to expect from other Greek restaurants.  The pita fries were new to me I polished them off.

Tip: There's an occasional coupon in the West Valley View that makes a visit a great deal.==================== UNDER NEW OWNERSHIP=================

Right off I should known something was different. On their website it says "Taps is a chef-driven restaurant and bar that specializes in a friendly neighborhood approach to hospitality; from-scratch signature and creative cuisine". Looking at the menu all I saw was normal everyday bar food being offered, My wife & I came here today because we had a gift card. I mentioned I had a gift card to our server Page and she explained the bar is under new ownership and they are not taking the gift cards anymore.

Because we were hungry we decided to stay. Page was very attentive and brought us our drinks right away. She gave us ample time to peruse the menu and we both finally decided on a burger..

I asked that my burger to be cooked medium. My wife wanted her's medium rare. Both burger were brought to us well done. That being said before I sent it back I decided to try it. Like I said I was hungry. The burger actually tasted very good despite it being well done. It was thick, appetizing and juicy. My wife thought the same thing so we kept the burgers. 

There was an odd flavor to both burgers we couldn't figure out. All I can say it was interesting. 

   --------------------------------------- OMG the fries   ---------------------------------------

One thing that is worth mentioning is their fries. I don't know about you but I love McDonalds fries. Normally restaurants don't even come close to their fries. Well Taps had fries that matched the look, taste and flavor as close to McDonalds that I have ever experienced. AMAZING!!
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
FOOD: The food is exactly what you would expect from bar.  SERVICE: Our waitress Page was friendly, professional and attentive. PRICE: The price  for the quality of food you receive is spot on.  AMBIANCE: Modern looking sports bar. They have a wine bar in the back (probably left from the previous owner). CONCLUSION: I think its a great little bar if you want to drink, mingle, or watch sports. RETURN FACTOR 100%. 
  
    ******************* What does my OVERALL rating mean? ********************

5 stars -Highly recommended.  I would be willing to drive out of my way to this business. It is that good. This place represents their industry or cuisine very well! 
4 stars - Highly Recommended. I would frequent this business. 
3 stars - Not that good but not that bad. Just average. I wouldn't mind going again. 
2 stars - I would not recommend this establishment to friends or family. 
1 stars - DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND DO NOT patronize this business. I would RUN AWAY from this place and you should too! DON'T WAST YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY AT THIS ESTABLISHSeems like a great little breakfast hangout. I tried the Piperrada (pork, bell peppers, onions, tomatoes, and eggs). This was a good breakfast - everything was tasty and seemed like good quality ingredients.

I've heard good things about their pancakes, and I'm definitely interested in trying out several other items on the menu, so I can see myself coming back often.This was a lot of fun!  The instructor was great.  I'm not very artistic but she gave very clear instructions, and we had a lot of fun!Solid beer, solid pizza, solid service, solid atmosphere.  Just an all around solid place to grab a pizza and a beer.  All the reviews on here seem to be spot on so there is really nothing more that I could add.I loved the gyro combo and  would have given them 5 stars if it weren't for the dolmas.  I was hoping they would be homemade like I used to get from my neighbor not what I got from the diners in NY(which are bought and served cold). Anyways I am still a fan and will go here when I am in town. Service was great I think it was the owner she was very friendly and food  came out quick.Great little gym. Very clean and never too busy. You can't beat the price either. The staff is very friendly but doesn't ambush you trying to sell services while you are training.We make it here about once a month and have always been satisfied. I've had the tacos which are very good but my favorite dish is the Cochinita Pibil (a marinated pork dish). My wife always goes for the chicken fajitas which she says is also very good.

The service here is also very good. Everyone is friendly and knowledgeable; for example, I had no idea what Cochinita Pibil was but my server not only explained it but recommended it.

This is a well appointed, classy Mexican restaurant with a large bar area.  At first glance the prices look a little high but you aren't eating at a restaurant ending with "-berto".Got the Brewlee burger. Got it cooked medium rare just as I asked, and it was really good. We also split wings and pretzel apps that were very good. I'll definitely be back to try some of the other cool menu items they had!Review for the food!

Hit up salads first, the mini individual sized plates were great. Tried the caesar salad, which was perfectly sized and great paired with bread. Then i tried the feta watermelon salad. It was so different! I had never had something like that, weird but crazy good. As i walked by I saw honey comb dripping & so fresh. Never seen that before either! Awesome! They said they have it flown in from Canada!

Next I went for the asian side. Had to try the veggie rolls, since I'm a huge fan. They were so crunchy & fresh. I could have gone back for 2nds & 3rds but i had to save room for everything else. I hate duck but was willing to be open minded & try it! It was mouthwatering, literally melted in your mouth. The fat was delectable. Orange chicken was unusual. Had never had it taste like that before but it was great tasting, dont get me wrong. It tasted like chicken fried steak to me & the sauce gave it this asian fusion. YUM! Dumpling & fried rice were nothing special. I passed on those after one bite. Korean rib was a little tough but full of spice. 

Going back for my third plate, I saw a vegetarian quesadilla filled with mozzarella, carrots and some greens tuff & topped with guac, salsa & sour cream. Holy moly, i never would have guess a veg dish would be so good! Grabbed the lasagna, which i think sat under the heater too long cause it was cold & the top was really hard. I wasnt a fan, it didnt taste authentic. Cute skillet though. Meatball was also tough but in a fantastic sauce that was packed with great italian seasonings. Went back for more of the meats & cheeses. i HAD to! The bree was heaven sent, especially when paired with the bread they had out & fresh cut bruschetta.Got a mini frier with chicken strips & fries. It was def comfort food & tasted as if they had gotten the recipe straight from popeyes. 

Hit up the mini burgers which were to die for! We asked what cut were they & they said prime! It was the tastiest burger Ive had in my life. I even went back for a second one! The mini heinz ketchups they had were the perfect size and handy. I didnt feel as if 20 other people had touched the ketchup i had. Im a germ phob. (SSH, dont tell anyone). Large selection of comfort food mash potato, sweet potatoe fries, baked skins & wings but i wanted to try other things, so i skipped trying them. next time! 

Noticed the cooks make fresh to order tacos with carne asada. Wow, was it tender! Fiesta spiced goodness! The tortillas were amazing w/extra zing! Impressive. I couldnt believe they made the torillas (corn and flour) right in front of you. Ive never seen that done before.The sauce bar they had was insane. About 15 different sauces & toppings. YUM! I wish i could have tried them all. Prime rib, asparagus & carrot were next. Prime rib was good but im used to bellagio melt in your mouth type. Saw lots of soups so decided the try the lobster bisque! Holy moly was it good! I loved it! Best seafood soup Ive ever had! I would probably go back to the buffet just for that alone, especially paired w/ the corn bread.

My 4th plate consisted of the beef tamale which lacked the correct spices, they just didnt taste as good as mine.. maybe im biast a little, since i make tamales all the time. The mexican sope meat pie was topped w/ guac & cheese, very good, a little soggy but i expected that. Lastly, i had the asian pork ramen. The bowl was large, the guy made the soup fresh in front of us. It was my 1st time having it. Way to set the bar guys! 

Dessert started w/ tirimisu, which had crunchy balls inside. Different but i wouldnt get it again. Blueberry Tart shot was gross, too tart. Lemon cheescake had a gold flake on it! amazingly tasty and gave that wow factor! Lemon cupcake was okay not a fan of the yogurt tasting frosting, so i ate just the cake. Large selection of sugar free desserts for diabetics?! Sweet! You hardly see that at buffets, well at least not that large of a selection. They had tons of cake/cookie pops. The little kid in me wanted to grab every one of them and run. Carrot cake was moist and good but had too much frosting. Banana souffle? Fluffy & full of flavor. I dont understand how they have it ready and cooked to perfection when they usually take 40 or more minutes to make. Chocolate chip cookie topped w/brown sugar ice cream was delicious. lemon tart? Pure perfection! Lastly i tried the azteca chocolate chile ice cream. best chocolate ice cream Ive ever had. Asked what was in it and he said chile and cinnamon. Good job bakers!

Cant wait to come back!Oh no, another Vegas Buffet.

Yes, this is another Vegas Buffet. It is big and with long lines, but you will soon realize this is The Bacchanal Buffet.

The Bacchanal Buffet is just a cut above the rest. Everything here seems a notch better than anyone else. The selections are vast and the details are a little better.

I stopped by for a Monday breakfast. Twenty-two dollars is a bit high for breakfast, but I walked out of there thinking it was worth the indulgence.

The Dim Sum was borderline bad, but I wouldn't blame them for trying. (Dim Sum is best served fresh)

Everything else seemed to be made and displayed in smaller quantities. I think this method works. The big trays and troughs of food that other buffet use really ruin great tastes.

They even had BBQ for breakfast! What more can you ask?

Again, their selection was wonderful and fresh. The orange juice was really freshly squeezed, the crepes made right in front of you. The many selections of egg dishes were a breakfast delight. 

Enjoy the indulgence! I'm going back to try dinner soon.All of the billboards and signs along The Strip serve as constant reminds that this is the #1 buffet in all of Las Vegas. For that fact alone, I'm sure any buffet go-er would be disappointed if they didn't give this place a shot. My foodie buddy and I must have timed it just right as we had less than a 5 minute wait on a late Monday morning as they were switching over to lunch service - which was great as we got to sample both breakfast AND lunch items. 
Visually, everything is very appealing. I especially liked how both the buffet and the dining areas seem to meander endlessly. It seemed like no two tables looked alike and the seating was comfortable and elegant.
I started with dessert first as the crepes made-to-order station really caught my attention. Sounds odd to say, but the freshly whipped cream was amazing.
It's not humanly possible to sample every offering, however 5 plates later my buddy must have tackled at least 400 of the over 500 menu items. My favorite items were the mini items served in tiny cast-iron skillets or mini- fry baskets, the tiny Wagyu beef sliders, the pretzeled bread nuggets and the glazed baby carrots. The truffled scalloped potatoes in the mini skillet and the shrimp and grits in mini ramakins were tasty as well. 
The buffet was, in my opinion, very protein and starch heavy. I would have enjoyed more fresh vegetable offerings. There wasn't a roasted brussel sprout in sight. The honey sampling station (?) and the deli meats and cheeses station didn't seem very popular. A bubble tea station would have been much more successful.
Overall very good and a fun Vegas bucket-list item for a food-lover.This is a really good and unique buffet. I can probably forgive the ridiculous waiting procedure they have since the food  exceeded my expectations. Speaking of which: you have to make a reservation at a computer ticketing thing and then they'll text you when you're suppose to get in line to pay.... Then you might have to wait some more depending on how many more people need to be seated. Our estimated wait time was 2 hours.... Ouch!

We came when brunch was being phased into dinner. For once I had a non-chewy prime rib at a buffet! The selection is interesting ranging from few Indonesian dishes, mini medium rare burgers, and bottled juices and horchata, to smoked salmon and good sushi. I really like how delicious the desserts are (and they were pretty cute too). 

The cashiers and seating hostesses weren't rude but it was obvious they were overwhelmed with the amount of people. The people at the food stations were nice especially the guys at the meat carving area. 

So, in short, I definitely recommend this place as long as you don't mind the wait or price.I saw Yellowcard here in November.  The Hard Rock really isn't lying when they say the venue is "the next small thing."  It's perfect for up and coming bands since it's a small intimate space.  You can stand pretty much anywhere in the room and see the stage and band well. The acoustics are pretty good.  There's a bar in the back and the prices there are actually cheaper than at the casino bar.  Depending on who's playing, I would go back to the venue.We didn't mean to walk in her, but seeing the chandelier from the outside just lured me in! Love stripes, so this is the perfect place to pick up some goodies for yourself. Since it was the holidays, the staff was offering up goodies themselves- champagne and chocolates. Are you kidding me? I can sit in this store all day! 

Lots of travel and makeup up bags, doggie accessories -how about a $200 pearl leash for little Roxy, my puppy. Wall to wall of handbags and Christmas gift novelty items of the original Henri Bendels store. I especially liked the snow globes with the doggie shopping and towers of gift boxes all around. 

My friend purchased some travel toiletry cases in the traditional stripe with the hopes of purchasing the limited edition tote bag that was offered over the holidays. The service was excellent, considering we may have been the life of the store at the time. I will be checking in to this place on the next visit and maybe pick up some birthday presents.Amazing experience!! 
This is a great activity for locals and tourist alike.
Staff members were beyond professional, friendly, and fun.
They offer all kinds of classes, private event hosting, and corporate bonding etc.
This was something I will never forget, and hope to do again.Went here for a late dinner with some girlfriends. Very nice inside for a Chinese food restaurant. 

The service was excellent and the food was delicious. The server even knew what to recommend because I can't have gluten.

Portions were very good and the food was really tasty. I will definitely be backI had a lot of fun here. We did the day and night tour.  Had a little bit of time before it started, so we grabbed the best bloody mary I think I have ever had. 

I am super gullible and super skiddish.  So I was glad we did the day tour before going back for the night tour, so I could actually look around and enjoy the bloody sights.  For awhile I thought it was actually REAL/true. hahaha but that's me being gullible. 

We returned at night and it was SO creepy!  The characters were all very into it.  And they could tell I was skiddish and took full advantage of that.  

Not sure if I would do it again, but it was fun, and amusing.I really enjoyed the Firecracker Jalape√±os!  The Japanese/Latin fusion was interesting. I had the tres quesos roll, and cheesy sushi roll took some mental adjustment. The traditional crunchy roll my daughter got was better. The service was great - very friendly!!  It was worth the visit, though my husband thought the atmosphere (lighting and decor) was too much like an adult club.Curry Zen is the newest Japanese restaurant addition to Seoul Plaza, but makes me wonder when its going to be changed to Reikon Plaza? You know Reikon meaning soul or spirit in Japanese... ah nevermind, terrible joke. 

I have visited a few times now since they've opened and noticed each time the curry increases in spice slightly as well as the amount of condiments on the counter. Now they have raisins, sliced almonds, 3 different mixed spices (mild, medium, and hot of course), fukujinzuke (mixed pickled vegetables), and pickled scallions. 

The menu is small ranging from chicken katsu, pork katsu, kurobata sausages, potato croquette, shrimp, a curry hot dog, and a couple of jello desserts Maybe its not their style, but if somewhere down the line they decide to add vegetables as toppings I would be all for it!

The best things about Curry Zen is the portions are good versus price (yay for college budgets), FREE brown rice option (paging brown rice warlord Misti Y), service is friendly, and I suppose that its an option for my vegetation eating friends as you can opt for the curry and a croquette. 

Lastly the only con I can think of now is... where am I going to park? With  all these thriving businesses in this plaza it makes parking a chore. 

A side note of the most nanoscopic size possible, I did see someone wheel in a few boxes with labels saying Java Curry. I'm not suggesting that it is not homemade, but I do wonder if they use their roux some parts of their curry? Just some thoughts from a noobs. 

100th, yippee.The Japanese curry gods have answered. Finally, there's a decent Japanese curry joint in town! Their menu is pretty small and simple. You order either a regular or half-size of white or brown rice with curry. Then you add accompaniments like tonkatsu, chicken katsu, potato croquette, and kurobuta sausage. I usually love a nice tonkatsu, but theirs is a bit dry and tough so I suggest going with the chicken katsu instead. Skip the miniscule salad . It's not worth the $1.50 price.I imagine this is about as good as pork katzu and curry can get so in that regard it could be five stars.  My favorite part of the meal was seeing you could get food from 1-10 spicy level but 6-10 cost extra.  I assumed 5 couldn't be that spicy but the waiter warned me against it.  3 ended up being about perfect.  

I'll have to trick a friend into getting an 8 or 9 some time.  In the name of science, of course.Got to the airport early and needed some breakfast. We wondered around a bit to see what our options were. This one seems like the best option. Sigh, why does airport food have to be so expensive? 

Here's what we ordered:
- Eggs Benedict
- Pancakes
- Steel Cut Oatmeal

Food was good. Loved the pancakes!This is one of my go to places for business lunches on state street. Fairly standard pub and BBQ fare with a gourmet twist. The prices are slightly higher however and the quality of service has been variable. Overall, I recommend. Really good soups in the winter.I really liked this Pizza.  We ordered a large pepperoni to-go and the guys behind the counter were friendly and funny.  They also have a lot of sweets that looked good.  Definitely check this place out if you like thin crust.  I like to fold the slice and eat it to the crust, then take the crust and dip it in pop.  Very tasty.(Read all the way to the end! Saved the best for last!)

We visited Umiya for a late lunch AYCE, Tues. around 2:30 and there was only one other group seated, so virtually we had the whole huge open place to ourselves. (Liked that!) Once seated, it took her about ten minutes to come by and take our first order. I'll say only one thing about the service and that it was chilly but businesslike: take order, bring order, clear plates, take order, bring order -no eye contact, no smile, and no re-filling of beverages unless we requested. It is what it is. I can usually warm up any chilly server, but not this one! Might try sitting at the bar next time so as to not be 100% reliant on the server. 

Nonetheless, the food was pretty spectacular. If you're familiar with the AYCE sushi scene in Vegas, you get a little hard to impress after a short time. This was a happy surprise and I'm delighted to be impressed after so long... 

The menu was indeed very extensive. I'm sure you could visit many multiple times and never duplicate, yet leave full and happily satisfied. Since it was our trial run, I took some tips from previous yelpers... 
1. Screaming O salad: did not like this - it was like a mayonaise soup. Steer clear if you don't like a heavy-handed dose of the stuff. 90% mayo, coating of thick mayo on top, three thin slices of ahi underneath, and some lettuce swimming in the watery mayo soup at the bottom of the bowl. Now we know...
2. The snow white roll and orange blossom roll were FRIKKIN AMAZING. Snow white roll -each individual piece of the roll is ever so slightly grilled, so it has a whisp of a smokey flavor. My little tastebuds were freaking out. Insanely good, and so different! Orange blossom roll was also enjoyably different.
3. Red Rock roll - kind of forgettable, but I do remember thinking, "ugh, more mayonaise?"
4. Rib eye steak - was just ok. 
5. Now, there's one thing on the menu we discovered this day I would place in the "EXQUISITE" category. The bacon wrapped scallop skewer. O. M. G. These tiny little gems come two (ONLY TWO?) to a skewer. Just trust me -you're going to want a few of these. I popped the first one in my mouth, and just had to sit there for a moment-what was this? Sweet, salty, chewy, fluffy... what? I just stared at my pal across the table. No words. Eyeballs scanned the restaurant for next closest waitress/server. "Yes, another one of these, please?" I forced my now-stuffed table-mate to try one because they are that good. Crack. Bacon-wrapped-scallop CRACK. 
6. Mango mochi for dessert. Couldn't hold a candle to the sweet candied bacon wrapped goodness I just described.

Few little notes:
- I could imagine a full house, with such a big open space and all hard surfaces would get pretty obnoxiously loud. Prepare, and time your dining session if that would bother you.  
-They charge $2 for green tea. This really chapped the hide of my dining partner. He was personally affronted -like they were charging for breathing air. Again, so now you know. 
- Service with a little charm doesn't cost anything, but apparently its not a priority here. Ok, got it. (The food outshines this aspect of Umiya.)

Overall: excellent and delightfully impressed, will be back, again at an "off" hour.

(Let me know if you like those bacon-crack-skewers, too!)We love their food. Even my husband who doesn't buy into the whole organic/free range thing says their eggs are the best he ever tasted.  The only reason I had to take off a star is because they dint have a caffeinated soda so my husband would rather head down to a place that does...if they ever add one in, we would be there every week for our Sunday brunch.I am a big fan of festivals, and also happened to be lucky enough to win a pair of VIP tickets via Yelp (Thanks again Misti!), so I decided to check out the Asian Food Festival. Upon approaching the SIlverton, I saw tons of rides and booths set up and I was ready to have fun and eat a lot! 

Upon walking into the festival, I was in food para-para-paradise! I saw many familiar food vendors,as well as some new ones and I was eager to eat a lot! For my main meal, I decided to try some Filipino food since I've been craving it for a while now.  The food was tasty and reminded me of my best friend's food from back home in California. Having the VIP tickets was also a huge bonus to the fair. Who could say no to comp drinks?!

I am definitely looking forward to next year and the reunion I'll have with all the delicious food.just opened 3 days, i ordered Fukumimi ramen, karaage,& large curry with rice bowl. All were excellent. The best part is their location is near to my home and i dont have to drive to chinatown. The employees were friendly and nice.Good broth. Good service. Its not located in chinatown (big plus)... Everything is amazing just wished they used a different noodle. Found on small clump of uncooked noodle. No big deal. Will be back again.OK, there is a lot of potential here with maybe just a few small kinks to be worked out.  The atmosphere and cocktails were good.  Definitely make a reservation if you can because it was rather busy when I first arrived for a late lunch.
I started my meal with the New England Fry, which was good, but the real winner was the  Fried Chicken Sandwich.  The bun was just right and the flavors and textures of everything came together into a beautiful dish.  The chopped salad that accompanied it was woefully under-seasoned and bland.  
The dessert menu was a little disappointing.  I enjoyed the McConnell's ice cream very much, but none of the other offerings were too tempting.  My friend let me try her Triple Layer Cake which looked very homemade (not meant as a big compliment) and was just OK.
The biggest disappointment was the horrible decline in service as my meal progressed.  By the time we finished, the dining room had cleared out and there was quite a bit of staff cleaning up.  I tried several times to make eye contact with anyone, but was pretty much ignored.  I finally resorted to waving down a busser to ask for the check and it STILL took a while to get that settled.Loved everything about this restaurant! It's a little gem that makes me feel like I'm all the way back in my beloved San Francisco. 

No need to boast some big name Food Network chef here (as does every well-to-do restaurant on the LV strip)... the delicious AND FRESH! (remember this is Vegas and is an off-the-strip establishment) food and absolutely beautiful/quaint/vintage decor speak volumes! Oh, if only I could make my own house look that adorable....

The Tuna Tartar and Burrata/Tomato/Bitter Chocolate salad were my two favorite dishes. Nana's Chicken Curry and NY Steak were great choices too! Service was very attentive. The manager stopped by our table and personally shook our hands, also inquiring how our meal was... she was so sweet! Kudo's to Ivan our server as well!

Definitely don't miss this huge winner in the desert. I can't wait to see more and more restaurants with this kind of quality and character emerge in this city.Lunch was wonderful! I ordered the HS power lunch including, their version of a classic grilled cheese, soup & fries-- oh and a dessert of your dreams! 
Every bite was better than the last. I loved the flavor combinations and it was very filling. The dessert I chose was their bread pudding with a scoop of the salted caramel ice cream. The ice cream was hands-down the best I've ever had & that is saying a lot because I've had a lot of ice cream. ;)
I was ecstatic with the presentation of every dish & just the overall atmosphere-- very pleased & looking forward to coming back to try the dinner menu. -BGreat service and even greater burger... will be going back to try some other things on the menu.
The service was quite good... she even found us some regular yellow mustard...Thanks!Tried the Trails location for the first time. Our visit was on Sunday for breakfast. The place was crowded with a few people ahead of us in line but it moved quickly. After ordering at the counter the food is delivered to your table. The refreshments are self serve so you can drink while waiting for the food. I guess the kitchen was backed up since the wait was longer then I expected. The nice background music and good coffee helped pass the time.
Our food was delivered with a smile and was followed up to check on our satifaction The Breakfast Burrito was large and very tasty. The breakfast potatoes (cubed) were nice and hot and the portion was larger than necessary. We will be back to try the lunch menu. This is another great choice in the Summerlin Village and we look forward to supporting a local business that seems to be growing.Man, after an hour of walking the Strip checking out the freaks, whores, scammers and fat tourists like myself these tasty little devils hit the spot. Tried the asada, carnitas and al pastor tacos and all were good. Typical street taco tortilla filled with some way savory and succulent meats. Would've awarded 5 stars if they were $1 instead of $2. I am the taco terminator and yes homie....."I will be back".Pho Pasteur & Grill is one of the newest Vietnamese cuisine restaurants to open its doors to customers in Las Vegas. It is located in the Westwind Centre strip mall on Spring Mountain Road, next to Marnee Thai restaurant and across the street from two $20/hour reflexology/foot spa locations.

In spite of the chilly weather, I was the only customer there the entire time I ate my extra large order of Pho Dac Biet ($9) at an extra leisurely pace.  I thought it was good, and not excessively salty. They have a large menu of items (from traditional Vietnamese pho restaurant offerings to Chinese), some of them even have photos on the wall to help those not familiar with Vietnamese and Chinese cuisine in narrowing down their potential menu selection.

The staff was efficient and my order came our after just two or three minutes.  The place is also clean, including the restaurant's restroom. Which is always nice.

There are a lot of Vietnamese pho restaurants in the area, but I will come back and explore their menu further.This cafe has a great atmosphere. It is a great place for a leisurely chat with a friend over some tasty treats. Even though it is summer, I find myself craving their thick hot drinking chocolate. It is so thick and rich that it is served with a small spoon.Free and fast wi-fi.  Friendly staff.  Delicious house made menu items.  Atmosphere is cozy and perfect for getting some work done or chatting with friends.  I only gave 4 stars because the temperature inside was a bit too chilly but I'm from Texas so, maybe i'm just not used to it.  Still, a fireplace would kick this place up a knotch on my list.REVIEW #50!

Ahh so this is where used DVDs, cds and video games end up! This huge place has a large inventory of newer movie titles in DVDs and an eclectic selection of older DVDs &  VHS tapes. There are also some vintage video games like Gameboy games as well.
 
The cashier I spoke to said this store opened a week ago. I came across this place after having lunch at the new macaroni restaurant next door.  As you enter there is a bargain bin. From what I saw the main area had DVDs in center, VHS tapes along back wall, the games towards the front and music CDs along back wall.  There is a display case also that had video game consoles and accessories.  Most DVD were under $4.99 some were as cheap as $1.99!  Some newer titles seemed priced at retail price though. There were TV series sets also some as low as $3.99!  

Everything is sorted alphabetically. So you'll spend alot of time going thru the aisles if you are looking for a dvd. The store had a slight musty dusty smell to the place but other than that it's clean, bright and spacious. Staff was friendly.

You can bring in old DVDs, VHS, CD tapes, video games and consoles and get paid cash for it. I'll try that next time. And for those of you who like to post pix to social media sites..snap a photo and post it online and show what you posted to cashier to get a discount off your purchase. Came out of this place with a bunch of vids for dirt cheap!This place is a bit baffling. I have been twice so far, one time was not good at all and the next time was excellent! I think I may have ordered the wrong thing on my first go (and that's why I gave it a second go and held off on reviewing). The first time I got the mango tango (or soemthing like that)...which was mango snoh with mango 'pudding,' mango jelly or something and some kind of caramel sauce I think.... it was really weird. Kind of tasted chemically....I think it was the sauce or the pudding (which was more like congealed substance than pudding). I left very sad. Anyway, the next time I went, I got thai tea snoh with nutella sauce and almond cookie...this was so ridiculously good. The Thai tea snoh had a great flavor...really captured the essence of the tea...the cookie gave it a good crunch and the sauce was nutella so it is pretty much required to be delicious. I will definitely be back again and recommend it....just order wisely my friends.I've only come twice but they ran out of the Brioche French Toast both times :(! Apparently, they only made 2 per day or something. Why can't they make more? :((

However, what I have tried have all been pretty good, save for the eclair with the vanilla filling (they ran out of the chocolate ones). The French Chocolat Twist was surprisingly better than anticipated. The two sandwiches I got were better than I anticipated because I'm not a cheese person and yet I still enjoyed them.

WHAT I'VE TRIED:
Croque Monsieur $7.50
Vanilla eclair $3.50
French Chocolat Twist $2.70
Breakfast Sandwich $3.95
-- ciabatta with ham, Swiss cheese, and one egg omelet

They also have Peet's Coffee.Big Lots has big bargains.  I've never really looked around in here, even though I've stopped by searching for one item or another before.  After perusing the neighboring store with the big red bulls-eye that I always go to, Alicia R. and I walked over looking for one of those soft, cushiony kitchen rugs because the other place didn't have them.  We found them, but also decided to check out what Big Lots has to offer, walking up and down most of the aisles.  Although it's not as big as the bulls-eye stores, there's quite a selection of furniture, kitchen items, home decor, food items, cleaning supplies, etc.  My laundry detergent is $1 cheaper here and I saw at least one dining table with pub chairs that I'd buy when I move.  I also spied Guittard semi-sweet chocolate chips for $2.75 that I'd use for baking cookies as well as the biggest selection of Bob's Red Mill products I've ever seen.  Plus, it's not busy; there were probably three other people when we were there at lunch time on a Monday.

The bottom line is that I need to start shopping at Big Lots more often, especially with this location so close to work and another location right in my Summerlin 'hood.  Check it out when you have time and see if you spy some bargains, too.I am literally in this plaza twice a month and I have never seen this place.  It has a very "chain" feel to it.  Plasma tv menus, floor to ceiling Greek paintings, Greek colored everything.  I thought it would be very generic but the food was surprisingly good.  They use Kronos just like 90% of places you will go.  The pita was slightly over cooked like they didn't use enough oil but it didn't hurt the flavor.  They are a little too conservative on the Tzatziki for my taste so I would encourage you to order some extra.  The fries are boring, but I'm picky.  Overall they offered a good value if your in the area.delicious,  the fries and onion rings are amazingLoved this place! 

The wait was a bit long, but it was rush hour around lunchtime so it made sense. Around a 30 minute wait. Doesn't make a difference when you can walk around Planet Hollywood and shop for a bit. 

Ordered the American burger and the Parmesan fries. DELICIOUS. Loved both and even though the burger is relatively small, it's still filling. Will definitely return one day.Don't let the line deter you, they're very efficient in sending out hosts with ipads who will take your name and text you when table is ready! Props to them for incorporating technology in a great way! The burgrs are pretty damned good, but the fish sandwich was awesome. Fries and rings were great too, loved the different sauces. Great drinks - superfruit acai berrry was tops. Great, friendly and efficient service! Overall a really nice experience!!Everything was amazing except the price.It used to be a bank branch and has a drive -thru window :-)  I love the egg-white/turkey sausage sandwich on flatbread. And the coffee is pretty good too. the service is very quick. Haven't had any donuts.. yet.Just ate here for the second time this morning.  I've only had breakfast here.  For about the same price as a value meal, you get cooked-to-order eggs, hash browns, bacon, toast, and coffee.  On Saturday and Sunday their special is the 3-egg combo - which is everything I listed above for $7.  My husband got the BLT sandwich which is said was good for the price and had just the right amount of bacon.  It gets the 4th star because it's a nice and clean restaurant with fast service and very little waiting - which is not what you get at the more popular local breakfast places.  For a good quick hot made-to-order breakfast, you can't go wrong here.  There will not be fancy food options - just good old-fashioned breakfast items.Was in the mood for Mediterranean food so I headed to yelp! What a great find. Place is kind of small but very comfortable food is great atmosphere is nice and service was good as well. We had the hummus, the salad and beef kabobs. Kabobs were so good I had a second order which I shouldn't of had because I was exploding :) will be back again.
 It's a hooka lounge so it might be smoky at times.Super friendly service, everyone smiling. Damn good burger, nicely seasoned fries. Banana shake makes me feel like a got a week's worth of potassium in one go.Met some women for our once a month get together. Great atmosphere, outdoor seating and fabulous food. Loved The Vixed by design store next door! Not fond of parking but it's worth looking for a spot, there is a vacant lot behind the building.Try this breakfast joint last week and I really enjoyed it. Our waitress was very attentive and she took care of us with great service. Since this restaurant supposed to have the best biscuits & gravy I ordered my breakfast with eggs, biscuits & gravy, sausages and hash brown. The gravy is really tasty! I want more gravy! I want to eat everything with that gravy on top. The portion was pretty big. Hubby and I had enough left over for lunch. 

Coffee is not like diner coffee, stronger and better to my taste. Come try it guys.que bueno que comentaste que encontraste productos argentinos. voy a ir a conocerlo. :)This is the perfect spot to take friends who are unfamiliar with Korean cuisine.

The menu covers appetizers, some fusion (Korean-Japanese) dishes as well as traditional Korean BBQ meats.

The restaurant is nice and clean and there is a grill in the center of each table to cook the meat.

We had a party of six and two of our guests had no previous Korean dining experience.
They liked the fact that we prepared our own food. They even had forks for these poor souls.

The outcome was that everyone had a great time and wanted to come back again when we return to Las Vegas for next year's convention.

All the items are per portion so I imagine it might take a visit or two to get the quantities right.

The server was very friendly and hip and ready to assist all the various levels of guests entering Gangnam.This is my second time hrre within a year and i am once again pleased.  Try the scallop appetizers, they are large and delicious.  we tried the spicy albacore roll and the chimi roll.  The chimi roll is huge and would probably fill you up by itself.  To me the spicy albacore was hotter than the menu said, but is was very good.  We also used a restarant.com coupon and saved bout 12 dollars off the bill.This is my favorite place to stay in Vegas, oficially. There is a bit of rock and roll in every detail. Lots of good restaurants in the place, and the pool scene is out of control. They have cabanas with misting systems, flat screen TVs, cocktail waitresses, and a mini fridge packed with food. The pool is complete with a water slide, island bar, swim up black jack tables, tons of young people and the best music playing at all times. The rooms each have huge plasma TVs on the walls and contemporary decor with framed pictures of various rock legends. Overall a great experience. The only bad thing is that it is not on the strip, but nothing a quick cab ride can't cure.Hard Rock...I wish I knew how to quit you.  

Yet you keep luring me back with the offers of comped nights and other bennies that make you practically irresistible.  Your rooms (what little time I spend in them) in the Paradise Tower are clean, well appointed, and the bed is quite comfortable and among the best I experienced in Vegas.  Most importantly, you're so much more relaxed and civilized during a mid-week stay than over the weekend when the "trust fund kids" come to town with mommy and daddy's money in their wallets and vodka and Red Bull coursing through their system.  During the week, for the most part, you can play blackjack without having to sit at a table with drunken idiots that have no clue.  You can actually sleep without being awakened by drunken idiots screaming in the hallway and pounding on guest room doors at 4 in the morning.  You can go to the pool, get a cabana and relax without the fear that people will be taking a piss, throwing up, or copulating in the pool.  

Yes, Hard Rock, if you keep those tempting offers coming my way, I'll keep coming your way...but only during the mid-week.Went here for brunch this past weekend. I really like this space and their menu looked amazing. I opted for their Chilaquiles. I am a HUGE fan of Chilaquiles and these did not disappoint. You can have Chicken or Veggies with this dish. I went with the Veggies. I got my eggs scrambled and they were light and fluffy and brought this dish together. I also got a coffee and I really liked that they serve their coffee with a french press. I did think the coffee could have been better, but this did not effect my review at all. It was just one piece of criticism I would offer up. I will definitely be back to try more dishes. I give this place two thumbs up.Great margaritas n yummy fajitas.  The prices are right in line with other family Mexican places in the area.  Very nice wait staff. Nothing fancy about this place as I sit in sneakers and jeans with a belly full of fajitas. .definitely recommend for a nice lunch/dinner out when you're being low key. Oh and its not just a name. .the fajitas come out in a flaming presentation.Each year, at the beginning of spring I take a short vacation - two or three days. I gather up my meager savings, pack my bags and head out to Sin City and one of my favorite downtown hotels.

This year thanks to an offer for a two night complimentary stay I checked into the Downtown Grand - once the Lucky Lady Hotel and Casino. This modern hipster destination, just a short block from the Fremont Street Experience was a pleasant surprise. In fact, the whole block was a surprise after having seen it in a completely different state during my visit this time last year. I was amazed at the transformation from seedy skid row to quaint inter-city block lined with tables and chair that front restaurants, a popular biker bar and shops. Truly a welcomed and needed change to this once neglected area.

Parking is a little tricky, there is only one way to access the front of the hotel and valet parking off Steward - self parking is off Ogden across from the hotel/casino.

Here is where I say, there is nothing like staying in a newly built hotel, everything is so shiny! The rooms are small but nicely done and include a flat screen - beds are pillow topped - yes - and the bathrooms are modern - easy Internet access. Let me not forget to mention the central air - a wonderful thing! They have a nice little diner on the casino floor - Steward and Ogden - where a delicious and reasonably priced meal can be enjoyed. I had breakfast there and it was great. There is the "Mob Bar" - it is dark and inviting - you'll have to check it out - I would have hung there if the good jazz band had been a little quieter - leaving the noise of Fremont Street, I would have enjoyed a little lower decibel level in the cozy bar. 

The Casino is fitted with all the newest machines and gaming tables and is lain out in such a way that it is easy to find your way around. There is a lovely shallow pool on the third floor roof and lots of seating along with a picnic area where on selected nights they offer live entertainment. 
 
A couple of things I did not care for. Completely over-priced Cabanas - $350.00 for the day. Hey, guys! That is what The Hard Rock charges, and they have private tents with TVs and small refrigerators plus a real sand beach. You are over priced for what you are offering and quite probably, your clientele's budget. Also please, please give each floor an ice machine and provide more than one room key at check-in. One should not have to chase down their traveling companion every time they want to access the room. 

All in all, I enjoyed my stay at the Downtown Grand and give it my recommendation.This place needs to STAY!!   Absolutely the best Vietnamese in the valley. I have only had one better Bun, and that was in San Fransisco (which makes sense as there is a huge Asian population there). 

We have been there twice and both times the food was delicious. Different flavors, but shouldn't be scary for the 'American' palate. Both times we had the #16 Bun w pork. And the #20 Soft egg noodle w veges and beef. And the wonderful spring rolls. 

As the other reviews have noted, not much atmosphere ( I may take my iPod speakers next time). The server is extremely friendly and helpful. When we had dinner there the last time, I had mixed my pork and veges and noodles as your supposed to do, But she stopped by and put the rest of my sauce (kind of a light dressing) on my food and motioned to mix it more. I bet she wanted to help me and do it herself. Very cute.4 stars for location and maybe 3 for food. Drink specials weren't amazing but not bad either. The location is what makes this place - right outside Monti's in a great patio. 

We went before a concert and had a few drinks and some apps. The positives of the food were that you could get $5 tapas but they were pretty simple. Our favorite was the braised beef and chirizo on the sweet potato chip. It  was filling and tasty. The taco had braised beef but wasn't my favorite. It was really messy and just didn't taste as good. We also had the chicken lollipops which were different than i thought they would be - they were grilled chicken with franks red hot on top. Now don't get me wrong, that combo can't do anyone wrong, but for a restaurant/bar with that kind of rep, you would think they were the bone in wings, frenched and then presented differently. Call me whatever you want for that comment - just saying.

Anyway, we will be back here anytime we are around since we did have fun, we had great service and it is a great patio. For the money, the food wasn't the worst but i would rather go somewhere else, even if it was a bit more money.My friend and i sat on the patio, it was so nice outside. :) cute beach vibe with the bench chairs and all. Love all the lightings too. 

The hummus nacho was delicious. Its a musttt. :))
My friend got the bruschetta pesto. That was tasty, kind over kill with the tomatoes,  but it was good.

Drinks. Pheewwww
Grapefruit basil martini was sooooo friendly. One was enough for me. Haha :)
The peach fuzz.. ehhh.. all I taste was juice. So negative on that.  Haha.

I want to go back and try their entrees :)For what it is and what it costs this place is perfect! Can definitely find some better sushi places but I would still come here again.Pizza square was great with the salad - very good quick food for an airport.I love the opportunity to find the good deals but agree with previous reviews about the hypercolor selection and lack of varety at discount prices. . Accessories are deeply discounted and truely the place to go for just accessories.Let's get real...

The fact that these guys made it through an INSANE Saturday Farmer's Market and lived to see another day is HUGE in my book. The place was packed... PACKED and with relative ease they got through the entire line. They were slammed... SLAMMED! (Why must I repeat everything in caps? So you know how hard these guys are working to make your time at Alterra memorable!) 

Let's be honest though, there is no shortage of java on The Square, but It's awesome to have such a well know Wisco entity really excel at drink AND atmosphere AND interior AND staff (I could go on...)! A lot of other java joints can't claim that, and for that reason I will certainly be back. 

The space is enormous and I love the different seating areas. Study sesh? They got you covered. Community collective? There's a table just for you! When the patio doors open this summer sitting up front will be a blast.

I hope they can give "the buck" a run for it's money. Don't get me wrong, Starbucks is how I started drinking coffee, I'm no hater.... but Myspace is how I started using Facebook and well, sometimes you need to let go of things in favor of better things. Like some awesome iced coffee, a rad selection of tea and food stuffs that taunt you from behind the glass case. I haven't had some nosh yet but I plan to and I'll let you know what I think. 

In the meantime, can we talk about the Terrace looking chairs out front? 

Did you bring those down from MKE Alterra? 

A slight nod to Badger Nation? 

Whatever the case, I like. 

And hundreds more will on weekends when it's nice enough to sit outside!This place is super amazing highly recommend for anyone looking for decor items . Unique pieces & large selection to choose from.We finally got the chance to visit this restaurant, after putting it off too long. We sat at a high-top table in bar section, where there are several TV's turned to sports. Our waiter asked if this was our first visit, and, when he learned, he highlighted their menu and cocktails. We ordered the Brisket dinner, with flour tortillas and excellent cole slaw. The brisket was done perfectly. Nice and lean with just the right amount of smokey flavor. Smoked meats can sometimes be over powering, but, theirs is done just right. It could have used additional BBQ sauce, perhaps, on the side would have been nice. We also ordered the smoked turkey melt, open face sandwich. Again, the turkey was smoked perfectly. Bacon, melted cheese, tomatoes made it excellent. We ordered the Yukon gold fried potatoes for an additional $2.00, which were again excellent. We added the side green beans, which we had heard were good. They are saut√©ed, and extremely flavorful. Just a side note that they use cloth napkins, which is a really nice surprise. They offer a full bar, with an extensive beer selection. The staff is very friendly and inviting and, well trained. We would certainly return, especially to try other specials on their large menu. Chef Fox has a good thing going here...It's the little things that make good places great, and Cafe Zupas does that well. The food is good, especially for the value. Went there for dinner and got the soup/sandwich combo. The small soup, bread and 1/2 of the sandwich filled me up, so I took the other 1/2 for tomorrow's lunch :)

The chicken tortilla soup was slightly salty, but the flavor was still pretty good. On the other hand, the crab avocado sandwich could have used a little more salt, but again, still pretty good.

The complimentary chocolate covered strawberries are a fantastic touch! Nice end to the meal. They also have a cool drink bar where you can create your own specialty beverages. There are a few suggestions listed on the cup.

All in all, they do a great job of distinguishing themselves from Panera (or other similar concepts). Cheerful staff, bright, clean interior. Definitely coming back again soon!Got to try these guys at the Foodie Fest this past weekend, and what better way to break them in then here? 

Tried Da Big Baos which were like any Pork Belly Bao I've tried. Still, the best value is at Cheesecake Factory where you get the same set up for $5.95, but they're known as Vietnamese Tacos(Why? IDK???) We also tried Da Lobsta Balls which were decent but kinda tasted like kamaboko(fishcake) instead of lobster to me.

I wish these guys continued success, and give them a try if they are on a street curb near you....ALOHA!!!

YELP 100 CHALLENGE-(91/100) "Mobile Pho and Other Asian Snacks"Love Elaine! Always happy when she's available since I've seen her since she had a couple tables way back when but everyone is very good. Best gel in Vegas, no doubt about it. No rough edges, thin application - looks natural and feels great!!!7/7/13

A plane crash at San Francisco Airport forced us to stay an extra day in Vegas. After we checked out of Mandalay Bay and had our luggage stored, we walked around and stumbled into the Four Seasons, which is encapsulated around the Mandalay ground. Their pool is right next to the Mandalay Beach separated by partition.

So we were killing time until it was time head back to McCarran.

PRESS is a lounge overlooking the pool area. It consists of a full bar and a coffee/espresso stand. You can make purchase of coffee/tea and pastries and sit at the lounge, or order cocktails from the bartender. PRESS have plug-ins to recharge your iPhone and iPod dock. There's complimentary wifi. We split our time between the cozy indoor lounge and the poolside wicker chairs outside. It's perfect for catching up with friends or just chilling, reading a book.

A cosmopolitan is just $12 here---yes, at the Four Seasons and service is impeccable. They turned on the mist outside and parts of the section have cushioned booths that sit up to 10. It's a gorgeous beautiful place hidden away from the Strip. I'll definitely return for drinks in the future.First time here. The patio is cool and service has been great (our server's name is Alex & she's been awesome!). Just enjoying a couple of pitchers and people watching. It's pretty chill & I much prefer that to the scene across the way. I don't even mind the country music :) Will have to come back & try some food!SkinnyFats is a fun little joint hidden behind the madness of The Strip. The location is tucked away in a warehouse center, and the closest place of interest is the Hustler House, if that's your type of thing. I was really confused why this restaurant found its way here. I think it could do even better in a hotel or maybe closer to UNLV or possibly in Town Square.

The restaurant is much too tiny. My cousin and I came here on a Sunday afternoon, and even though we were able to find a seat rather quickly, everything felt so cramped. We came here with a baby car seat, and I do not recommend that. This place is best visited in pairs. You will not enjoy dealing with big groups here.

Now for the food. Surprisingly, there aren't really any desserts. But oh my goodness. I still loved my food! The portions are very generous for the prices. I had the Drunken Gypsy Toast and the Ahi Taco-San. Yum!

I wasn't expecting the toast to taste that sweet! It was delicious! I probably could have used more whipped cream, but it was still a lovely dish. Aesthetically, it looked gorgeous. All of the fruits were fresh and sweet. My bacon was good, too!

The Ahi Taco-San was excellent. The tuna was cooked to perfection and all of the stuff that topped the taco was scrumptious and paired well with the tuna. There were jalape√±os in it, which I'm not a fan of, but I totally didn't mind them in this taco. Everything about this taco was to die for, haha. And it was so decently priced!

Overall, my experience at SkinnyFats was a good one, I only had a few details to pick at. I certainly recommend this place to anyone looking for fun,  filling food. You'll have a blast here.I've always been a fan of frozen yogurt and ice cream, so I figured I knew what I was getting into when I visited Kuma. I was totally (happily) mistaken! Snow cream isn't ice cream... nor is it frozen yogurt. It's more like a cross between Hawaiian shave ice and frozen yogurt. Whatever it is, it's super delicious! 

I typically make my own combo rather than choosing from the pre-made list on the wall. Strawberry snow cream, pineapple, strawberries and chocolate sauce make for a delicious and refreshing treat! 

The layout of the store could be a little better-- there isn't too much room for seating and it gets pretty crowded... but that's my ONLY complaint!This location just opened. May 24th 2013 was there first day of business.

I hadn't eaten at a Schlotzsky's for many years, so being as I work in the area I was looking forward  to having somewhere new to have lunch at.

I've eaten there twice now since they opened. On both visits they were fast and very friendly. Being they're brand new  you really wouldn't expect less than stellar service.

The food was good and a real change of pace to what has been available around here.I go out of my way for Quik Trip. But it's Phoenix so you don't need to. They are everywhere, like weeds. But good weeds, maybe more like roses. Anyway, the Super QT is like most. And even though it was 5:30 PM and loaded with people, I still found a pump to gas up. The sandwiches were almost all gone- probably a dinner rush, but I still took a ham sammy, got a refill drink, used the mostly clean restroom and was on my way happily. Love QT!One of the better burgers in town. The Pretzel bun is very tasty and holds up well . We shared the hangover hamburger and Sicilian pizza. I was expecting the Sicilian pizza to be a little bit more tasty. Hangover hamburger had bacon and eggs which earned the accolades from burger magazine as one if the best. The best surprise were the fries that come with the burger. They were prepared perfect, crispy but not over done.

The place is upstairs with a small parking area. If you are into beer, this is the place for you with a huge selection on tap.

The service was good and friendly. Could see this place as a great place to hang out to eat and drinkHoly cow the IVAN Burger is the best burger I have ever had in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area.  Outstanding.  Just come here and buy it.  They have a Burger & Beer deal on Wednesdays ... I feel like this burger is good enough to come weekly and enjoy.

Besides the burger, The Attic has Great service and Good Happy Hour Deals.

The only things to watch out for:
The patio is deserted in the summer.  I wish it could be covered more or have some more misters.  Because of that, it can get pretty crowded inside.  I bet when it's not the summer the patio is great though.  I've heard parking can be a pain, but I didn't experience that when I was there.  

Overall, this is an amazing find and I can't wait to return for another Happy Hour soon!This place is really good! Like others have said, the decor is awesome. The chandelier is beautiful. Went tonight with my parents and husband. The restaurant wasn't full at all. Our waiter, Jason, was great. He was very personable and attentive. The food was good. We got the bacon & dates wrapped meatballs, gorgonzola flatbread with honey, and seared diver scallops appetizers. The flatbread was not crispy, it was chewy, and a little on the oily side. It wasn't bad, just not what we were expecting. Our entrees were the cajun chicken and shrimp pasta, jambalaya, spicy seafood pasta, and pan-seared atlantic salmon. They were all very tasty. No complaints. Definitely coming back.Great Mexican restaurant in Waterloo, and it's far more than just tacos.

To start, they'll bring your table some complimentary chips and salsa, which is a major plus with me. Some Mexican restaurants don't do this, but the nicer ones do. The chips are also freshly fried in house it appears. Also, when we ran out they offered to bring us more, which I kindly accepted.

My girlfriend ordered the tortilla soup, at a reasonable 6 dollars. I tasted it a bit, and I have to say that it was flavourful, and perfect for a winter's day. When I'm here next, I will definitely consider ordering this over some tacos.

I ordered a couple of tacos to try out. I got the pork belly one which was recommended, and was definitely the better of the two. Though it was messy to eat. (not that I really care, but you might) The other taco I had was the beef taco. The beef had a great texture, and was moist, but it lacked a lot of flavour. I used the hot sauces on only the beef taco, and it still wasn't as flavourful as the pork belly. Also, I thought the pumpkin seeds were gonna be roasted and crispy. But the seeds were soft and really just melded into the taco and didn't add anything except visual appeal.

The star of the show, and what I would assume is their signature dish because it was that good was the fried chicken. This is definitely worth ordering. You get 3 pieces for 10 bucks. But I believe it was a rib attached with a wing, a breast, and a thigh. The skin and batter was fried perfectly and was extra crispy. And it's tossed in a lovely combination of honey, tequila, lime, and black pepper. It's also garnished with cilantro and green onions. I would definitely order this again the next time I'm back, and I think that could be in the near future.Exellent Beer List that gets updated and changes frequently. Great Mac' n' cheese. The Bar tender Matt is a beer guru and introduced me to some new beers that are amazing.Great atmosphere for after work drinks or dinner. 50 rotating beers on tap, really great food. My favorites are the homemade salt and vinegar chips, grilled artichoke, cheese curds... I could go on. A little pricey, but consistently good, and they have a discount at happy hour. I have only eaten in the bar, but the service has always been great.This resort is the "perfect escape" from the endless craziness that happens on the strip! 

The hotel is clean, the village is far from crowded, and the staff will accommodate you to ensure your comfort! 

The only luxury that I'd missed out on was the spa. I'll definitely do that the next time we visit.This is my first visit and I had the rice plate (forgot the name) with the shredded pork, grilled pork chop, and egg loaf,  it was delicious until I got near the bone. The meat near it was a little pink.  

I also ordered cha gio, which to me was over cooked in the fryer; more like on the burnt side.  

Price to me was the same as anywhere else. 
Their biggest drawback is the location as it is hidden and when a place is empty the food turn over ratio is a lot slower and not as fresh.I've seen quite a few people post about terrible service and bad food.

I had the opposite experience!

We went with a few coworkers to celebrate the beginning of fall break!

We had a 1/2 day of school and found out that happy hour started at 11am!

With $2 drafts and well drinks and cheap appetizers, how could anyone go wrong?

We had a great server who took care of our large party, separate checks and all!

The food was tasty, the drinks were cheap, and the fun was fun!

I ordered the fried bologna sandwich and was not upset about that! Totally reminded me of the ones my grandma would make when we were kids!

Will definitely go back for HH again soon!Sorry to hear 5 people called out, take charge & if people don't want to work get rid of them. I imagine it is not easy to get good people in, but keep trying you have a good thing going. The service needs a lot of work they have had to turn away 4 groups of patrons since we have been waiting 30 mins already for food. Waited 40 mins for food and it was not hot barley warm. Haven't seen the waitress more than twice. Jake did come to apologize for the long wait and was very kind. Food is good even if we had to wait a while for it. 

Layout of restaurant is not good for flow & restaurant management.  They need some help from Robert Irvine. I hope she can make it since Maricopa needs some good quality food place's, any place that can ofer fresh & GF gets a plus in my book.  Good luck to them I hope Helen can continue to make her dream come true.I'm no Chinese connoisseur but I really enjoy the food and it's always chock full of fresh ingredients which is huge for take out. The owners are super sweet and the little girl will always talk to me. Very respectful and thankful for service. We were sad to move away from them.I needed x-rays done and they don't take appts for that (if they did 5 stars), but even during the bust lunch time rush I was in and out in about 1/2 hour. The staff was very willing to help when I needed copies of my films also.I had a 2 hr layover at Phx, was hungry and trying to find something vegetarian! The cheese pizza at Humble Pie came to my rescue, and how!! Simple and fresh. I really did love the herbs. Friendly staff too!!One thing I miss about living in San Francisco is having take out options that go beyond pizza and Chinese food. Every now and then I am just looking for a take out treat that is just a little bit lighter. So I was really excited when I stumbled upon Taiga, and was hoping to add it to my list of options. 

Located across from one of the entrances to Sunset Park, Taiga could easily be missed. The only thing remotely interesting in the shopping center it is located in is Sunrise Cafe (which is constantly bustling and how I found Taiga in the first place). I'd walked by it a dozen times, and one day after grabbing coffee decided to stop in and grab some take out. We ordered the Taiga shrimp, the garlic pork rice bowl, and the grilled octopus. They also have a basic sushi and sashimi menu, some pretty yummy sounding salads, and some other tasty looking entrees. 

The food was definitely solid. The rice was maybe a little bit mushy, and the shrimp which were wrapped in wanton paper weren't anything special, but as far as take out options go I was totally satisfied. I'm interested in trying some of their other menu items as well as giving dining in a go, as the restaurant is cute with dimly lit lighting and comfortable looking tables. 

Overall I would probably give them 3 and a half stars, but I'll bump them up to 4 just for having take out options that I haven't been able to find anywhere else. Extra points because they also deliver, and are kind enough to walk your order over to Sunrise Cafe if you would like them to. If you are craving Japanese give them a try.The filet mignon teriyaki & rice plate was really good! Same for the shrimp tempura appetizer.. The broccoli was yummy wish I could've gotten more lol.  You could definitely tell everything was fresh! I say at a regular table not hibachi. 

Only dislikes were they didn't have any shrimp tempura rolls.. They have some but no classic ones for those of us that don't like raw Fish .. Oh & the smell when we walked in wasn't to pleasing but the food definitely made me forget about it :) I'd also like to see them have the option of getting fried rice with the dinner plates like they have for the hibachi plates .

* we also got a 10$ gift card for next time :) can't wait to go back & use it!!We love the pizza and wings here. Tony the manager is friendly and sociable. I do not like that one of the managers sits in the bar on his laptop when customers could sit there. A little frustrating that a booth dot for 4 is taken up by one guy with a laptop during Happy Hour. Never been disappointed by the service and we enjoy the atmosphere.This place is awesome. I don't often go furniture shopping but I just moved into my own place and purged a lot of my old stuff so I needed to get a new couch, dinner set, and tv stand. I hate feeling like I'm getting hustled but I definitely did not feel that way at LivingSpaces. I walked in and was browsing around when Jason approached me and asked me if I needed any help. He was awesome and definitely did not try to upsell me on unnecessary expensive pieces. 

I think I spent an hour and a half in the store tops. And most of that time was just me being indecisive about things. It was such an easy process and my furniture was delivered 2 days later. The guys who delivered everything were efficient and able to get the couch through my narrow entryway without and scratches. 

I'll definitely be back to this store because everyone was super friendly and the prices really can't be beat. I'm excited about my purchases and even sent my friend to the store and she got a couch too!Mouth-watering shortbread and choc toffee that will have you coming back for more. The owner is super-friendly and helpful, the shop has an overwhelming aroma of butter and sugar that make the shopping experience all the more enjoyable, and what's more, FREE SAMPLES!

So, why the 4 stars? Simply because in my book ¬£1 is too much to ask for a single cookie- unless it's the size of an open palm.A few weeks ago while driving around i noticed a few people walking into this hole in the wall type of place, didnt think much of it at the time but every time i drove by after that my curiosity kept making me wanting to find what this place was all about. Last night was the night in which i hadnt even finished my plate of delicious grilled goat with rice, steamed cabagge and spinach with some black beans in which i was already planning my next meal here. To tell you the truth the service was a little slow, the original menu item i wanted wasnt available (the chief cook had the night off) and they offered me and my friend the grilled goat and the marinated chicken. By the end of my meal i was thankful i had the goat....it was beyond amazing! I must say that i am ready to try more Somalian dishes.....im sold on it! Next time im trying the kabobs with the yellow rice.The pizza I ordered was the veggie gluten free pizza. Of course it wasn't as good as the real thing but it sure was tasty! The ginger lemonade was also great and the staff was super friendly.I was encouraged to return to this location by management. And I'm thankful for the invite to return. This chicken is good. This fish is better! The fries are even best. This place got another star out of me. The spices they use are unexpectedly good. I will return again today and I'm looking forward to the crunchy spicy goodness that's slap yo mama goodness!This place is pretty solid.  Not sure about some of the complaints with waiting.  I called and ordered take out, showed up right when they said to and it was ready.   Seemed like the kid at the counter was new but the place is new so it's kind of expected.   Also, the price complaints?  I mean it's not the bell.  We paid $15 for a burrito 3 tacos and nachos.  I feel like that's pretty normal.   The burrito was awesome.  The tortillas here are great.  I didn't like the hard shell taco, but my wife got soft ones and hers were good so go with those.  The hard shell ones taste and look store bought.  We will definitely be back.  I'd say I worry a little about the place because they don't advertise clearly and it's a huge space for a taco joint.Went here with some friends for a birthday brunch.  The location is right by the Las Vegas City Hall and presumably provides dining options in a specific portion of downtown that otherwise lacks options.  The restaurant validates parking for patrons.  The decor is very urban, concrete jungle with industrial looking tables and high ceilings.  The place has a very modern but friendly feel and offers plenty of seating with a properly proportioned dining room.

Service was very good and the waiter made sure those of the patrons partaking in the bottomless mimosas had refills when needed.  I had the MTO signature breakfast which consisted of turkey bacon, spam, sausage, eggs, mash browns and toast.  This was a tasty combination and I'm not a big spam fan from prior experience.  Another member of our group had a chicken wrap which was fresh, and appropriately portioned.  The french fries were shoe string or thin fries and were very good.  The pricing was not bottom basement denny's level but was fair.

This is a great place to go for breakfast, lunch or brunch.  If you hate hipsters and cop an attitude about any place giving a hipster vibe, you should probably go somewhere else.There was a small wait for dinner on a Sunday night, but, worth it. Once seated,  service, with Ethan, was excellent. He was very knowledgeable of their extensive beer menu, and, offered several recommendations, when asked. We had the "Notorious Burger"as well as a build your own turkey burger. The "Notorious burger" came just as ordered, med-rare. It comes with cheddar cheese, nice crisp bacon, notorious sauce, lettuce and tomatoes. The bun was nice and fresh. They serve it with a side of their homemade coleslaw, which is slightly spicy and excellent. The build-your-own,was a turkey burger, which was also excellent. We ordered a side of homemade regular fries and a side of their homemade onion rings. The fries are served with tomato bacon ketchup. All of the food came promptly and freshly prepared. The onion rings were huge and nicely battered. Next time I would order one, and, not both, because it was a lot of food. The burgers are large and juicy, with very flavorful beef. No room for desert. We would definitely return. They do offer a full bar with a large beer selection. I would like to suggest offering a 1/2 and 1/2 with the onion rings and fries, that way you get a little of both worlds....The food was super yummy! My favorite was the checkerboard roll. I have one sushi place I normally stick with, but it's definitely worth coming back to bei!Delicious ribs and pulled pork. Great service and free refills of homemade iced tea. 
Not very expensive for what you get. 
I will definitely go back again. Cute interior. Limited seating but it seemed like most people got takeaway. 
Must try.Roshambo + Ramen galore + Shaved ice + Okonomiyaki + Japanese beer = A great Saturday 

Good food and good company on a lovely Saturday afternoon (or night if you went later than me).  The festival lasted from 11am - midnight and was filled with performances, food, and booths from local organizations.  Yes, it was a hot and I wished they had more covered seating, but that is the benefit of going in groups.  This way you just have to rotate who is going to get the food and who is going to hold the fort down in the shade. 

Logistics:  Tickets were $8 at the door ($5 for pre-sale at local shops and restaurants around the valley).  This event was also very family friendly and free for children 8 and under.  Once you got in you there was a line to buy tickets for Ramen ($7), soda ($2), and beer ($5).  Warning though the beer was cheaper $3-$4 from the non Ramen booths.  From 12 pm to 1 pm this line was super super long, but after 1 pm it definitely died down.  If you wanted other food like skewers and Okonomiyaki (Japanese pancake) no ticket required, just good old hard cash.

Hiromaru: By far the longest of the Ramen lines and for good reason.  It has a very rich and creamy broth without being overpowering.  The noodles were on the thinner side which I personally like because I feel like I get more broth with what I am eating. This one did steal the show in most everyone's heart.  They are originally from Japan, but the flyers said that they were going to open a shop here in Vegas and I will be a future customer for sure.

Iroha: Another festival favorite.  They had the second longest line.  Their noodles were much thicker and their broth had a little more spice to it.  The servers warned us that it was spicy, but I didn't think it was bad at all.  

Vegetable Okonomiyaki - Lots of fillings, heavy on the pickled ginger, and still squishy on the inside.  I like it, but if you a super crispy pancake this might not have fit your fancy.

I had a wonderful time eating and drink from the different booths, hanging out with friends, and even my failed attempts at Roshambo (rock paper scissors) to win gift certificates for local restaurants.  I'm pretty sure I will be back next year :)Nice little place that was even nicer before a bunch of loud obnoxious customers started coming in. Now it sounds like a bar. Still a 4 start joint in my opinion.I have been here a few times. Good food and good beer!  There are power outlets at the bar and some of the tables.  The service is always a challenge though.Good eats and lots and lots of libation choices.

If you're new to the pasty world, try the Oggie- it's the most traditional. My husband loves the red wine gravy sauce that it comes with.

Also, it would be really good if the owner could ask his waitstaff to not play with their facial piercings at any time when they are working. That was a little disturbing.A caf√© serving kick ass coffee, vegetable and fruit juices, powered up smoothies, raw desserts, soups, porridge, salads, coconut water, and with the happiest vibe around.

Run by the lovely ladies who own Meadowlark and Ashtanga Yoga Edinburgh (the yoga school on the corner two doors down), they took over No 39 and stripped off the dark red walls, threw out the white chocolate flapjacks, got a new coffee machine with advice from Freemans, and voila! My new favourite caf√© in Edinburgh.

Don't diss raw food till you've tried it. This isn't vegan food that tastes like rabbit food. This is delicious treats, salads and vegetable juices that will make you feel AMAZING, and taste delicious. Raw cheesecake has no dairy or gluten, or added sugar. It's cashew butter with cacao (or banana or something similar) for the topping, and crushed nuts for the base. I dare you to try it and not like it. 

And paired with one of those rocket fuel coffees, its a match made in heaven. The coffee was quite pricey at ¬£2.20 for a small cup of Americano. But it was the best coffee I've had in a long long time (and I drink a lot).

The juices are largely vegetable based too. Fennel, cucumber, beetroot. None of the blood sugar spike you get from an orange and apple juice, or a berry smoothie (pretty much the same reaction on your blood sugar as cake). Nope. A green juice with ginger is going to cure that hangover far better than a bacon egg roll (trust me, I'm a devotee of bacon).

They opened on the weekend of 8th November, and have shut the week 11th November to consolidate. I think they re-open 15th November so I suggest you head down there when they do and grab a kick-ass coffee, super charged juice and raw treat.A restaurant specializing in pasta dishes named after classic rock songs? Sign me up!

Went in and placed an order to go, wait was fairly reasonable considering I was right behind another couple that had walked in. Staff was polite, restaurant was clean, treats in dessert case looked appetizing.

Ordered the Sweet Home Alabama and the Slide meatball sliders- sliders were solidly average, but I appreciated how they were packed with an additional cup of marinara for dipping. Pasta dish was a good-sized portion with delicious gouda sauce, 7 pieces of barbeque popcorn chicken (a little dry inside), and some red onions. Initially I was a bit apprehensive about this dish, but it really worked. Even the slight dryness of the poultry was easily overlooked by the sauciness of the pasta.
Very pleased with my order.

Final note: take out orders are packed in the brown cardboard boxes, which is a lot nicer and more environmentally friendly than styrofoam. Portions for the pasta are large, saved half my order and the extra slider for tomorrow's lunch. With tip, total was under $20.A great place for happy hour.  The cocktails are sophisticated and well balanced (not too sweet). I love the design of the restaurant and decor. The food tastes like it was prepared with care.This is actually my second visit to this place and so far, this by far is my favorite spot for local Filipino food! And its only a block away from my house!! Wooohoooo! 
Lumpiang sariwa is on point!  The flavor,  texture of the wrap is hands down the best I've had. Roasted pork belly ( lechon kawali.)  I have to say, it's better than the ones I've had in this town which carries so many Filipino restaurants that are over priced yet, this place delivers with every damn bite! 
Located just 1/4 mile off of Silverado ranch and Maryland parkway... 
I will for sure be back for sure,  most likely on my days off...Neat arrangement and an interesting mix of retailers.  Parking is available in a lot or on the street but is not free, at least during the day.  Neat giant praying mantis sculpture at the entrance.  Maps of the retailers are available as are staff who are more than happy to guide you if you ask the right questions.  But for the complete experience, best to browse through once before making any purchasing purchases.  Especially true for food.Artistically creatative. I'm hoping this brings the city more revenue. Prices seem to be pricer than one might expect for being downtown. 

Hoping more tourist make it down this way to share the Ora of a new age for the down town scene. I've brought my guest from California down here hoping to share some culture for them to spread.

There is a sense of no tolerance for negativity with security and law enforcement presence. I was happy to be able to see that their are boundaries and curfews inforced. ;) keep up the good work downtown project. I'm sure theirs many challenges ahead to turn around this area and proud to see iniative.Stunningly refreshing!  Even though it was a cold night we decided to swing by the newly opened Joe's.    Inside are a ton of antique items that you could touch and play with.  Well at least I did.  But that's not the reason you come here.  So we ordered something simple.  A small Bada Bing Cherry Italian ice and a small vanilla chocolate twist cone.  Both were delicious.   The Italian ice had almost a dry texture.  And the soft serve had fine bits of chocolate.   I mixed the ice cream with the Italian ice and the pair are truly marvelous.   

This is a place you really gotta visit over and over again to get a taste of all the yummy treats.  I'm salivating right now thinking about what I'll get next.  However I don't understand with all the high quality products, they serve standard supermarket grade Dreyers hard ice cream.  That's something I'll take a pass on.   

It is a tad bit pricey but probably in line with many of the other fancy dessert type places.   You can see their prices on their web site.  

Service was okay too.  You can tell they were all still just getting into the swing of things.

Overall it's a great place.  I will come by from time to time as the flavors are just so darn interesting.Is it a club?  A show?  A bar?  A restaurant..?

I was confused before arriving, and I think I'm even more confused now that I've been.

At one moment, I'm in a study sipping on a hand crafted $16-plus-tax-plus-tip Mark Twain in "The Study", and the next I'm being swept into a private room by a young version of the Mad Hatter for story time.

After being given some punch which "aids in forgetting" about the story that I'm about to be told, I'm presented with a blindfold from a silver platter, which by the way, also holds an old school revolver.  The story, which is told by the Mad Hatter's counterpart, is deep and interesting, yet difficult to follow.  My heightened senses of hearing and scent are stimulated with various sound effects including the sound and smell of burning fire.  When I'm asked to remove my blindfold, there is a contorted woman in the room, doing a handstand, holding a bow & arrow with her feet, and aiming it at the Mad Hatter who is playing the piano on the opposite side of the small room.  After he is shot by the arrow and dragged out of the room, we're asked to quickly evacuate as well.

The level of weirdness and wonder doesn't change much throughout the night, as there is constantly something interesting going on.  Tap dancers on the bar, a guy playing a saw like a violin, singers, a female beat boxer, and more are just a few examples of the entertainment that seemed to pop up randomly both in context and location throughout.  I never knew where to comfortably take it all in, as at some points I was either behind the stage, hovering in the dining area, saddled up to the bar..  I always had that feeling that someone was going to tell me "you're not supposed to be here"; but they never did.

All these experiences occurred within a few short hours, and I was (almost) completely sober.  I'd definitely like to come back for more!We won tickets to see Vegas Nocturne and went on a Saturday night for the 7:30 show. The venue has a speak-easy atmosphere and all the staff were very friendly. We had a drink when we arrived and one drink was all we needed:) The bartenders were awesome, had patience with our group, and helped us choose what to have without overselling. The drinks were very pricey but it's Vegas! For the show we had second row seats and before the show the performers/hosts came around and talked with us. We later learned that they were gathering intell on us to participate in the show. We didn't get included but some others around us did. The performance was amazing and was sort of a variety type show. I won't tell you much as you'll have to see if for yourself (or read other reviews that reveal more!). What I will say is that the early show is little less provocative but still very adult. 

The dress code is similar to a nightclub; no sneakers, no athletic wear, no shorts, etc.The show lasted about 90 minutes. Our seats were folding chairs but they weren't that uncomfortable. It might have been nice to sit a little further back in one of the more comfy chairs with a table but being close to the action was worth it. I can't say that I enjoyed one performance more than the others because they were all impressive. The ladies will enjoy the bathtub performance though;)

I know others have complained about ticket prices and if I had to pay face value for what our tickets were I doubt I would have went. However, if you can find them at a decent price (less than $50) I'd say go and check this out. There's always a deal to be made in Vegas so I'm sure tickets can be found! Plus they can easily make up for it with their drink prices:) I've heard the later the show the less expensive but definitely more intense.Went here with my girlfriend last night and had a good experience. Hostess was friendly and we were seated promptly. The number one thing that stood out to me was the ambiance in the place. Really cool looking decorative design in this restaurant. The vaulted ceilings above the bar really pop.  Our drink orders were taken in only a few minutes and our food orders were taken shortly after. We ordered a combination of different tacos. The fish, veggies, and shrimp tacos are delicious. Overall, this place does a good job! 

Pros: 

-Great food
-Good service
-Reasonable prices 
-Awesome ambiance

Cons
-I believe I left my card there and still waiting to hear backVisited this place yesterday Saturday night and the food was really good. The atmosphere was great, too. Oh, and good customer service.Formerly McDuffy's Sports Grill. Many upgrades, refurbished bar area, new tables, stools, chairs, booths. Renovated restrooms. Has a clean, modern, steel look with wood accents. Menu is upgraded including standard sports bar food with added entrees, appetizers, new craft brews including local favorites. On first impression, food is greatly improved. Wings were very tasty, well-prepared. I recommend getting the wings fried and finished on the grill. Seems to seal in the juicy meat and keep a crispy skin. Cobb salad was excellent! There was no skimping on the prime ingredients! Service was friendly, prompt and attentive. Only negative reflects my personal dislike for country-western music, but it wasn't blaring loud, so it was tolerable. Would have been nice to hear a variety of country, classic rock, alternative, indie, etc. -- although there was a digital jukebox available, so I will check that out next time... Also I look forward to sampling additional menu selections. Couldn't find a website yet.I'm a fan. Great concept, cool decor. I'd be there often if I was living in the area.My wife and I had breakfast this morning and were glad to see a new place near our home. Mgr came over to say hello and staff were all very friendly. Place is big and VERY clean.
We shared a Joe's scramble and had left overs for our dog. Great coffee too
Hope they do wellAlthough I don't visit cupcake shops as often as I did before I still consider myself to be a cupcake connoisseur. Finally the infamous Sprinkles opens in Vegas. I have been here 3 times already and I can say the best thing I got from here is the Sprinkles Sundae, which consisted of carrot cupcake and salted caramel ice cream. Absolutely amazing! The best carrot cupcake I've had and that certainly means a lot considering I've tried carrot cupcakes from multiple cupcake places (Cupcake Station from Michigan and Kara's Cupcakes in San Francisco). The thing that makes Sprinkles' carrot cake so unique is the long strands of carrot, om nom nom. The salted caramel ice cream is divine as well, if you are a caramel fan. The consistency of the ice cream is really smooth, almost like gelato, but not quite there. I've ordered the salted caramel ice cream on it's own and yes it is a bit salty, but if you have it with a cupcake it is delicious. The people working at ice cream section even warn you that it's salty by itself so I highly recommend having it with something else. My first visit I had lemon meringue cupcake with vanilla ice cream which was just a okay, but nothing to run home about. I am certainly a fan now, however when I first tried Sprinkles at their original Beverly Hills location I didn't enjoy it as much. The location is really pretty since it is located at the Linq. The staff members are all nice and helpful. There is a cupcake ATM present, however I would just prefer to go inside since the cupcakes should be more fresh from there.This place is off the hook busy at any given time! The ice cream flavor are awesome! I had a captain crunch root beer float this last time we went. Don't hate. Try it, it was amaze-balls!  They have a cupcake section and an ice cream section.

The flavors at each station change dependent on the day you go, so check the menu when you get there to see what flavors are available that day.

If you want an ice cream sandwich, get there earlier in the day, as once it's evening time, 99% of the cookies are gone, gone, gone!

Don't want to wait in line for a cupcake? No problem! Head around the side of the building and purchase your cupcake of choice via their cupcake ATM. Yup, you read that right. CUPCAKE ATM!!!!Well, there is no question that the food is good. But the service is slow and unorganized. For being one of only three people in the store, it took about 10 long minutes to get my food. But based on my observation, it seems that the two guys working here are the owners as well who just began their operations in this business.

They seem relatively new and still kinda conforming into managing this place. Nevertheless, I see potential since the food is pretty good. But there is still a lot of organization to improve on.My first time at O.H.S.O. and it was a good experience. We had the beer brunch, which was a great deal with delicious food. The biscuits and gravy were great. The atmosphere is fun and the patio is superb. 

My only negative was the service. Our waitress didn't seem to know much about the menu and told us one price for a side and then charged us more. She also didn't ask how we wanted our eggs cooked, so my partner wasn't keen on the scrambled. Oh well, nothing awful, but definitely not a bonus for the place.

I will definitely be back and come for brunch, just will look for a different server.We went here for a nice steak dinner. They give you complimentary popovers. First time i had them and they were good. We started with the tuna tartar. We thoroughly enjoyed the tartar but they give you chips to eat the tartar with and very few of them. Slightly disappointed. 
I ordered the lamb chops because they sounded yummy. Boy oh boy i was very happy with my choice. Great flavor! I ordered a side of asparagus which was cooked perfectly. They were nice and crunchy. 
My friend ordered steak. The NY strip with bone in. He said it was fab!
The truffle mash-potatoes were not as good as i thought they would be. My other friend's steak was not worth the price but i forget what she ordered. 
The staff was attentive. If you leave to powder your nose, the cloth napkin will quickly be snatched up and refolded for your return. They also sweep off the crumbs from place setting for each course served. Kinda tedious if you ask me. 
So food overall was good. However i would never go back. The prices were high and you don't get sides with your meal.I like Tropical Smoothie Cafe and if you work anywhere near family court, you MUST be as excited as I am that this place opened!!  I went on April 25, and I think it had just opened the day before or something like that.  It was crowded (see the aforementioned excitement at this place opening near family court) but well staffed.  I think they were still working out some bugs as everyone ordered PRETTY MUCH the same thing yet the prices were ALL OVER THE BOARD, but I do think they will get this worked out.  The food was good, the smoothies were great, and I am hopeful the service will follow!!First time here.  We didn't know what to expect, but were pleased with the fresh food and friendly staff.  It's a great quick stop when you need good food fast.  I would would come back for sure.  Only thing to change is that the eggs were closer to looking soft boiled then eggs Benedict should be.  Good clean atmosphere!
