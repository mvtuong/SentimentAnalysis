Just like the rest of downtown Phoenix, this place was dead. Our server was slow, taking 10 to 15 minutes to bring out our drinks. The food was okay, but nothing to write to my Yelp friends about. If you can find somewhere else in downtown PHX, I recommend you give it a try before ending up at this place.Can't remember the last time I was at a Hard Rock Cafe. This visit was only memorable for 1) Amanda Peachey's gorgeous face and voice 2) the jungle like humidity inside the place.

Our servers were attentive. Our drinks were frequently refilled. But it's just not as "hard rock" when it's so family friendly. It's a very small space, and being in downtown Phoenix on a Saturday night in summer, it was sparsely populated as well. 

Maybe I'm missing the point, but overpriced drinks and signed guitars on the walls do not bang my shutters.Went here for lunch one day because the excellent Asian Seafood Buffet next door closed (bummer!).  We figured, why not try a more traditional Chinese place?

It seemed like it would be good... The menu looked alright, like a typical small Chinese restaurant.  I ordered the General Tso's.  I have to say, it was terrible.  The breading was all wrong, the chicken was dry, and the sauce was an abomination.  Where was the soy sauce?  The ginger?  I submit to you that they simply took sweet and sour sauce, mixed in some hot pepper paste, and called it General Tso's.  I have made General Tso's several times, and nothing about this was even close.

The rest of the dish was forgettable... Just your typical white rice and water.  I'm sure this place has some good dishes, but I clearly didn't order one of them.I used to like this doctor, but now I don't.  The PA who used to examine my moles on an annual basis left, and the new one seems overwhelmed.  After waiting for months for an appointment, I waited 55 minutes in the outer office to have a 5 minute examination. Wonder how much they charged my insurance for that?It's a Vietnamese nail shop. It's not fancy. It's not particularly clean. The staff isn't particularly friendly, nor is the service anything amazing. Average, average, average -- and when there's an identical shop on every corner, average isn't good enough. I think I'll stick to the three shops on my regular rotation...I've heard good things about Tuesday Mornings so I decided to give it a try. 

It felt like a smaller cramped version of Last Chance with more housewares than clothing. And I am not a fan of Last Chance.

I was really hoping to like this store....but nothing thrilled me at all. A lot of stuff seemed damaged and the prices weren't all that great. Don't know if I'm just cheap or don't shop at high-end stores that much but when I look at a price tag and actually utter the phrase, "THAT'S a clearance price?!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!", it isn't good.

Probably won't be heading back. 

(Is the problem that I went on a Friday afternoon instead of a Tuesday morning?) (Just asking.....)Alright kids...here's the deal.  I'm a pretty big fan of Chipotle.  I grub on it in Tucson whenever I get the urge and this was my first shot at one in phx.  After watching one of my SGTs chow down on a burrito from "El Pollo Loco" I was JONESIN for a huge, badass burrito...gotta have me some Chipotle.  I just COULDN'T get it outta my head...

That's where I went wrong.  Sad to say, at this location, the burrito I received fell far short of my Chipotle Standard (oh yes, Ally has a Chipotle Standard...she is a silly monkey).  My rice was WAY undercooked, the guy behind the counter was rushing EVERYONE (update, dude, the line isn't that long...you can wait for ppl to tell the girl if they want rice on their burrito before you start the Inquisition focused on "sour cream?", "cheese?") and, although I know the portions are typically too large, my burrito was puny...puny, that is, by the Ally Chipotle Standard.  

Most people would prolly see this as a blessing in disguise.  "Ally, your fat ass shouldn't be grubbin on a massive burrito"...I know, I say it to myself all the time.  But, here is the deal.  I LOVE my fat ass.  And my fat ass is a good American...I fucking paid for it, gimme what i WANT!  I had plans for the remains of the burrito I SHOULD have gotten.  I was gonna eat it til I got full and then sat around with the remains, watching Rome and slowly nibbling it into annihilation even tho I would be WAY too full after consuming it.  This was my plan.  Eh, I coulda even saved it for lunch if I had wanted...but who am I kidding...it's totally not as good the second day.

Point of the story, CHIPOTLE rocks, but this location...eh, not so much.Have purchased trees here,tagged them,only to have them sold out from under me later.  Won't go there again, no matter how good the staff is. Miss the old owners. Kids don't count.After buying a vintage bike to restore for my girlfriend and on a recommendation from a co-worker, I decided to give Bike Barn a shot. Rich, one of the mechanics helped me get some bearings for the headset because one of them was completely rotted! Luckily one of the original ones was still in great condition. I told him I'd like to replace both since I'm re-doing the bike. He said he didn't have those exact ones but had some that will work perfectly. He went to the back & picked out new bearings... Got home and nowhere near close to fitting! Asked him some more questions about other pieces I'd need. He seemed completely annoyed at the questions I'd ask & just working there in general. Seems like he just wants to get through the day just to get to the cold brewskis in the fridge at home. The guy with the buzzed head & lady that work at Bike Barn are super nice. Unfortunately, by my first interaction here I will not be going to Bike Barn any longer I'll take my money over to Landis Cyclery.We were seated in the back in corner when the place was practically empty, without adequate light - romantic to some but obnoxious to others. Had a fake candle to set the mood even....  Like that flaming shot of delicious Sambuca on the cover page? Didn't get one, instead a fly added the excitement to the occasion. The food was pretty good, I'll concede to that. Good thing there was salt on the table. My real objection with this place is upon reviewing our bank statement a week later, we found that they had double charged us. I am please that they did refund the erroneous amount but did not offer anything for their mistake and our wasted time that resulted getting the matter corrected.

Boo this place.I hate to give a place two stars, but it was entirely based on the food.    I didn't really like anything I ordered.  The service was fine, and the ambiance was pleasant enough...

I had the won ton soup, house fried rice and the Chinese broccoli with oyster sauce.  The won tons were cool in the middle and the soup had frozen veggies in it - I have never seen won ton soup with peas.  

The house fried rice was flat and greasy.  My dinner companion commented that the house fried rice was more like what you find on the east coast, if that means anything to you.

The sauce ion the broccoli was twice as salty as they soy sauce.  Frankly, I was just really unimpressed.  I won't be back.

Does anyone know where to get good Chinese in Phoenix, because I sure don't.Went based on the great reviews and was a bit disappointed. The play area is small and dirty feeling. This maybe because most things are old including the benches for parent seating and the toys. The cashier was rude also. Was on the phone while taking payment. Won't go again.Well, where does one start. This place is a joke.
There customer service is horrible and so is there phone etiquette.

The front desk staff is rude, and its like there doing me a favor to help me.
But you know what, they sure will take your money. So dont waste your time, over priced and horrible staff.This must be the place that seasonings forgot...
I came here last night with two others. I had been there before but it had been years  and I don't recall anything about that experience.This trip however was just as the rating implies: "Meh. I've experienced better."
Our server was friendly, but not personable. Some people just aren't, and that's ok. The chips and salsa were great, I really enjoyed them. I wish their spicy salsa was spicier though. We started with an order of chips and guacamole. I don't think anything was added to the avocado. Maybe some diced up tomato? I could be wrong, but it really just tasted like mashed up avocado and a slight touch of lemon maybe? Probably more to keep it from turning brown, than for flavor. But there was no, or at least very little, salt and pepper.
Our entrees came out shortly after and it was the same story. Everything looked delicious, but was really lacking in flavor. I had the nachos with ground beef which I would usually love anywhere else but was very unimpressed. 
This was just "meh",This is a fair airport; it's old, the security moves at medium speed, the food is not very good.  As large airports go, it's just older and grosser than most.  Its poorly lit and feels "sweaty."  I would give it 1 star for the airport and 1 star for the free wifi.  It needs an update, which I think is coming, as they are collecting survey data right now to that end.  Please complete the survey an tell them to make it like MSP's new terminal!Thinking about airport food in Phoenix...NEVER AGAIN in front of Security!

Normal patterns have me flying out of Phoenix Friday evening and returning Sunday about noon.  Because of the only constant in life being change, I am now flying outta Phoenix Wednesday morning and back Friday morning.  Since it was 8:45 AM, I had no idea what I was going to find once I passed through Security, so I figured I would give Oaxaca a try.

Like most airport restaurants, it looks clean.  The menu, while varied, did not allow much for an innovative order.  My hispanic food passion of late is a guacamole burrito.  It's guacamole, onion, cheese, sour cream and bacon.  Between the milquetoast anglo morning register guy (looks too young and acts too immature to be called a "manager") who rang up my burrito by item...including the tortilla for the burrito...$8 for a burrito to go was a bit more than I anticipated.  Prices on the regular burritos and other offerings were a bit more reasonable, so I anticipated a pretty large burrito.

Milquetoast, the register guy, asked if I preferred strips of bacon or if I wanted my bacon crumbled.  I asked for strips.  He then asked if I considered 2 strips sufficient, or if 3 sounded better.  I replied that I would take what I could get for the somewhat large charge ($2.09) I paid for bacon.  Milquetoast then spoke to the grill guy in broken schoolbook Spanish.  The grill guy looked at the receipt and turned to ask me if I wanted eggs or potato in the burrito.  When I replied that I did not, he asked me if this was a breakfast burrito or a lunch burrito.  Looking at my watch and seeing it was still before 9 AM, I replied that it would be a breakfast burrito unless it was cheaper for me as a lunch burrito.  

The grill guy turned and scooped crumbled bacon onto the grill, added onion and slapped down a tortilla.  Everything heated and he assembled the burrito.  I could not see all of his activities, so when he put a burrito on a plate and called me over, I reminded him this was ordered to go.  He wrapped up the small burrito and handed me burrito and salsa in a bag.  I turned and headed toward Security to get to my gate.  

On arriving at my gate, I sat down and prepared to enjoy breakfast.  The burrito was as light as it was small.  While I had requested strips of bacon, the crumbles were well distributed through the burrito.  It is too bad that the guacamole and cheese were not, and there was no sour cream anywhere on the burrito.  

While my typical reaction in such a situation is to return to the restaurant, there just was not time to go back in front of security to display the incorrect order.  

If there is a next time, I just need to stick to the regular menu.The service in the bar & grill was great. My server Mitch took great care of me... however the food.... I would have been better off with a Carl's Jr $6 burger. The hotel staff in my hotel even told me their burgers were great. Far from the truth. The Black and Blue burger gave me a black eye! ouch... The fries a double smack in the face.Six of us dined for dinner after a recent Angels exhibition game.  The restaurant is on a hill with a beautiful view. We were greeted cordially and seated.  Our server was the best art of our experience. He was efficient with a good sense of humor. As first timers he explained the menu and asked f there were any questions. Bread and butter arrived quickly. Ou orders were promptly taken. So- so iceberg lettuce salad appeared shortly there after. 

There was one order for Prime Rib medium rare and five orders for various steaks. The meal came with green beans and corn on the cob. There were two orders for baked potatoes.  

The food came in a timely manner. The Primr Rib came medium well, was dry with little or no flavor. All of the steaks were over cooked. All of the food was Luke warm at best. We came to the conclusion that ths is a VERY LARGE restaurant; and it is difficult to individualize orders. We are not likely to return to this restaurant. The view, the magician and server were the best parts of our dinner and not the food.I went here for Mother's day with a big group of family. The dinner was a disaster. My uncle made the reservation for the wrong number of people, so I felt bad for the waitress, but it didn't excuse the poor service and food that we had. We were seated in the middle of the packed restaurant and the waitress came around and took everyone's orders. I ordered the build your own pasta with a caesar salad. The salad had barely any dressing on it, and was quite bland. Then our party waited about an hour and fifteen minutes for our dinners. In addition, we were not given any bread after the initial 3 loaves for 18 people nor water for about 20 minutes until we flagged someone down to get some. When the food came out, there were many mistakes. I do not know how they can mess up the build your own pasta because the customer fills out a paper form and checks the ingredients that are wanted.... well they did. My cousin got the same thing and ordered meatballs and meat sauce, and was brought out marinara with mushrooms.... hmmm. I ordered chicken, garlic, broccoli, spinach, and marinara. Well, it had no spinach and 2 cloves of garlic. The chicken was all fat, like it was what you cut away from a chicken breast before cooking it. It was some of the grossest chicken I have tasted. My brother ordered a dish that was supposed to have shrimp and some other meat in it...it came out in the smallest bowl I have ever seen and contained 1 shrimp. Really? Wow. All of the food was bland and of poor quality. I noticed their prices have gone down, but obviously it is at the sake of the quality.Went here tonight for my sister's birthday per her request. We had been here a couple of times a few years ago before my sister left for the military and we had a much better experience those times than we did tonight.

I got to the restaurant a little early before the rest of the party so I came in and asked if I could be seated. The restaurant was pretty empty at 5:30pm which is never a good sign even on a Tuesday. The hostess did not say her name or say much at all except for that our server would greet me shortly. I was seated next to a family of six with four small children and while I usually do not mind dining around children I felt as though the hostess could have seated me at least across from this family instead of literally inches away where the kids were screaming and running around the table. Pretty much every other table in the restaurant was open. The waiter came over and introduced himself and seemed very nice. He poured me a sample of the house wine and I decided to have a glass. About five minutes after that one of the children from the table over who was running around the table projectile vomited inches away from me. While I understand that this is not the restaurants fault it was extremely off putting and I really wish I wouldn't have been sitting inches away from them at this point. I immediately went to the hostess stand and requested a new table. She was accommodating and did relocate me to a booth but still very close to the original table with the child which was somewhat uncomfortable.

My party arrived and we decided to order an appetizer based on the waiter's recommendation. We order the stuffed mushrooms and a couple of salads. We waited, and waited and waited and finally our waiter came back to take our food order still no app after 20 minutes. We ordered our food and our appetizer came out about 30 minutes after ordering. Our food came out about 15 minutes later. Everything moved extremely slowly. Drinks were never refilled. No water was ever refilled. It was my sister's birthday so we asked if she could receive a dessert at the end of the meal. Our waiter said she could choose one so she chose the chocolate cake. It took 20 minutes for the dessert to come out. We were there for over an hour and not because we were taking our sweet time. The food was just okay but not great and I do not think we will be back again. Service is poor and food quality is just okay.I've had good experiences at this Fletchers in the past, but the last few times I've been there have been frustrating.  

They do not have a good system for oil changes - I have waited all day for an oil change more than once.  I have had conflicting information from different employees on scheduling appointments, and when I politely informed one of them, they acted like I was lying.  I agree with another post that sometimes it feels like they are working against you.  As a person myself employed in customer service I have to wonder how being against your customer can ever work for you.

On a positive note, they had the cheapest battery in the area (after checking several other stores, we ended up coming back there).  But my past few negative experiences there have overshadowed the positive ones.

All in all, after they were frustrating on the phone this morning (the oil change run around), I decided to pay a little extra and try Big O' Tires on Crimson.  Customer service was great and it was done over lunch.  I even used a coupon from their website.I stayed here for three nights for a business trip. The room itself was decent enough, a nice size with the feel of something that had recently been remodeled. However, the bed was positioned in such a way that a security light outside shone directly into my eyes as I tried to sleep- nothing that a few towels couldn't fix.
The carpets were being cleaned during my stay, and this is the one thing that specifically knocked off a star in rating. They were cleaning in rooms that were being occupied by guests, and there's nothing like walking around on damp carpet the first thing in the morning. Also, they were cleaning hallways and stairwells without proper ventilation, so it felt as if you were walking through a chemically-enhanced steam room. The free breakfast was perfunctory and nothing special- everything came from either a box or the microwave.It's ok, quality . Service was below par, although they were really busy. Fries were good and endless I guess that's good.. But, I was looking for a good burger, too bad I didn't find it here.I kinda been hating my last experiences here with my child.  Specially when certain employees seem rude and unhappy of working there. Sad to say that it's a certain manager. The salad  bar is pricey for its quality of vegetables. I get a dry bad tasting lettuce every time I go but then request it to be refreshed.  The games almost never work completely but I had no idea they were so old. I'm thinking they don't want to invest in it anymore. Even the smell of this place is kind of odd. I wonder how often the carpet gets washed. To the other pizza place here I come (except for the salad cause it's bad tasting too)!sadly, i can't let my old review stand. i hope no one went there based on that review. idk what happened butttttttttttttttttttttttttt our food this last time was not good. 

the beans on my friends plate looked like dried out play-do. it was really gross to look at from across the table, not gonna lie. and the lettuce on her plate was brown and wilty. i couldn't handle it.

 my food had this weird flavor and honestly....

everything had a weird taste, even my diet coke.  we both agreed everything had a funny taste. idk what it was. i was sad bc last time my dinner was so amazing. i probably won't be going back for awhile. or ever, i haven't decided.We went to Mimi's Café in Chandler today for breakfast.  Where the food was as always, the service was terrible.  The restaurant was not that crowded but the manager decided to seat us in a back corner table.  All of the customers were seated in this back corner.  It was so loud you couldn't hear the person next to you talking.  There was only 1 waitress for 7 tables.  Each table had at least 4 people.  There were 2 that had 8.  There was other staff around.  We saw them as we came in.

When the manager came around to pour coffee, we asked him for our check.  He said I will get your waitress.  The waitress came around asking to remove plates.  We had to ask for our check again. She left the check and we waited, and waited, and waited for her return. She didn't.  So we decided to take the check to the bar to pay and get on with our day.

We gave the check to the bartender and he said he would give it to our waitress.  We needed change.  So we waited, waited and waited.  A hostess was standing there and I asked her if should could help us and if she could get the manager.  She said, "I don't do that."  I asked her if she couldn't get the manager. She said yes.  I had to tell her to get the manager now.  She left.  I guess to find the manager.

The waitress then came to the bar to cash us out.  She told us that she would have to get the manager to get us change.  We finally told her to forget it we would pay with a card.  

The manager then came out.  When he was told of the issues and how poorly run his store was he just looked at us and said, "have a nice day."  Really, have a nice day.  No apology, no sign of remorse, nothing.  Just have a nice day.  Next time I want to have a nice day, I won't start it at Mimi's Café in Chandler.

Also, if you want to send a complaint or compliment to Mimi's Cafe's corporate office, there is no link on the website.  I guess they don't care what their customers think of them.It is what it is.  Overpriced, underwhelming food.  The burgers are ok.  The cheesecake is whipped (i.e., not good).  

I can't believe I spent $70 here.  It makes me die a little to write that.  Never again.The first thing I noticed was its nice patio area.  The second thing was its stand-in-line order process.  I completely agree with Gabi M, as having to wait until you reach the cashier to ask questions regarding the menu is quite annoying for us, and for the patrons waiting behind us.

My wife was going to order the Rancher Salad, as it came with  grilled steak and caramelized onions.  Interesting note: the menu doesn't mention that the steak comes pre-grilled, served cold.  Good thing we asked.  Cold meat didn't sound that appetizing, so she deferred to the Liberty Bowl + Pasta.

I was going to order the Salmon Plate but become enamored with the wood fired pizza oven, and went with a Margherita pie.  Good thing!  The salmon comes cured and served cold (the online menu didnt mention that, but the store menu did).  I also ordered a cup of caprese pasta salad.

While we waited near a boisterous table, we noticed how loud it can get inside, as it echos.

My cavatappi pasta in my caprese pasta salad was fairly dry, although it did come with grape tomatoes and tiny balls of fresh Mozzarella cheese which were good.  I wouldn't order it again though.

The cavatappi pasta also made an appearance in my wife's Liberty Bowl entree.  I would have opted for a penne or spaghetti or linguine, but am sure its much easier on the kitchen to have to prepare one pasta type.  I liked the sauce, but found the meatball to be almost chalky, but definitely crumbly, with a taste reminiscent of Chef Boyardee meat nads.  My wife didn't want to eat them.  I smooshed one on my plate and photographed it for your viewing pleasure.

The saving grace was their wood fired pizza.  The crust was fantastic.  Thin but not cracker crisp.  It was crisp on the outside, but soft inside, with a great taste.  I highly recommend this menu item.  They used a fresh crushed tomato sauce, which was spot-on.  I commend them for this, as they could have opted for the easy way out, using the Liberty Bowl maranara sauce.

Their dessert case did not contain many appealing offerings.  Most of them just looked dry.  For example, refer to my photos of the brownies and cinnamon rolls.  I agree with my wife.  If you are going to display something in a case for all to see, make sure its fresh and remains visually appealing.  If you're unable to accomplish this, why have a dessert case?  Where's the allure?

Sorry Liberty Market.  Our first trip was very disappointing, which means it will probably be our last.Don't do site-to-store. They will have you check in, but then leave you standing at the pickup area for 20 minutes with no assistance. I checked in a second time. Still no assistance. 

Eventually a woman came by and asked if I was here for a store pickup and proceeded to check me in for a 3rd time. I got my item, but no receipt.We used to come here when I was a kid-so recently on a visit to AZ we tried it out again. Not bad-it was weird that there was a special "only if you pay extra" section of the salad bar that had the good stuff like chicken and artichoke hearts for a few extra bucks, but it ended up not mattering because we went for the 2 meals for 20 dollars route.
It was fine-and the Greek Lemon soup was actually good. We were there right before it closed and a person working there gave us each a bag of chocolate chip cookies for free at the end of the night. That was nice.Have'nt been to this location in a very long time but I am not impressed. The staff was friendly and the place is clean. The restuarant was a little over half full but it took them over 35 minutes to bring out our food and everyone ordered breakfast. How long does it really take to cook eggs? I usually go to the park central mall location but the scottsdale location was more convenient today. Needless to say their service was very slow. I don't plan on returning to this location. Maybe too many snow birds go to this location or maybe they were just short staffed. But the food was still good at least!!I love chinese food... I LOVE bars..... I was really excited to try this place today. First, let me compliment the staff. VERY NICE PEOPLE. GREAT SERVICE.

Sadly, The food blows. Blows may be strong. Its just beyond average. This place is like Panda Express but with a cool bar.

I don't think you can call this place Gourmet Chinese...Enjoyed a fun UYE today to this Romano's today, joined by Masha Z., Arlin B., Mike C., Robyn N., Norm R. and Georgie M!  Although the company was five Stars, I'm sorry to have to report that the restaurant wasn't.     :-(

For this first visit, I ordered a Lunch Combination, consisting of Mushroom Soup, Sausage Quadratini and half a Roasted Turkey Sandwich...

*  The soup tasted good but was barely warm enough.

*  The Sausage Quadratini had just a little bit of the Italian sausage in it, & was mostly macaroni al dente, which for this particular dish is a foofy way of saying it was undercooked and tough.  Also, & the flavor, except for the actual sausage, was completely blah.

*  The Roasted Turkey 1/2 Sandwich had just a little bit of turkey (3/16"?), and almost no sauce of any kind on the dry bread.  There was also nothing on the table to put on to dampen it up except Olive Oil, so I used that.  

The amount of food for the money was ok, but the food itself and the preparation were weak.  Arlin B. had also joined me for lunch yesterday at an Olive Garden, and we both felt that the food was much better there, as well as 30% less expensive.  I doubt I'll return to a Romano's again.

3-Item Combination:  $10So I'm a typical dumb american who's been to New York several times and then drives by Ray's and says "HOLY CRAP, THERE'S A RAY'S PIZZA HERE!!!!!!" 

No. 

Epic fail dumb American, See "copying business practices" in business ethics book.

I understand that Ray's Pizza in NYC is for the most part independent but,I'm not that impressed with "Rays Pizza" in AZ, I'm just....not.

I don't know if I'm getting my hopes up too high everytime I  pull up to the place or, if I'm just going when my pizza palate isn't at it's peak.

Either way, both times I've gone, I mean yeah I'm satisfied and all but a part of me says, Meh, I've had better. 

The slices out front look delicious but just IMO fail to deliver the extraordinary cheese, greasy meats and crispy/chewy crust that all come with the NY pizza dining experience.

I guess it's okay, I just feel you can get a better slice from NYPD pizza or Joe's in old town.The only reason I am giving this store 2 stars is because of the bakery -the donuts and the cakes are ok. Just ok. 

As for the rest of the store, the selection is limited, the prices are higher, and the store seems dull,dirty and outdated.  

The produce is particularly awful. This is the second time now I have opened a clamshell of mixed salad greens to find it is completely rotten in the center. The prebagged apples were also rotten -only I sportted that before I got them home. The produce is terrible and in this case, inedible -and pricey!!! 

The bulk section looks dried out and old, I think the bins haven't been refreshed or cleaned in about 10 years. 

The staff as a whole seems very unhappy. The butcher, without fail, has been short,curt and unhelpful -almost sarcastic -every encounter I have had they are unpleasant, unfriendly and unhelpful. The cashier didn't speak until she had to give us the total even though I had greeted her.

Just a crappy grocery store -don't do it! Don't shop here -you will regret it! Now I have to go back in (in my spare time) to get my money back for this putrid salad. WHY why why did i go here when there is a Safeway and Frys within 1-2 miles? Oh right- I like the idea of this store .... and nothing else. 

I can see why and that they are struggling financially. If they keep this up? well their days are numbered... I am done this time -never to return.  Go somewhere else - anywhere !Outback Steakhouse
Multiple Locations

With all the hype and advertising it was only natural to try Outback. It was a Tuesday night, and we were seated immediately. We chose not to have anything from the bar, and instead stayed non-alcoholic for the evening.

Companion #1 ordered a bowl of potato soup. It arrived hot, with nice chunky potatoes sticking out of the soup along with large pieces of bacon. No complaints were heard. Companion #2 ordered the Cesar Salad. It seemed run of the mill, and companion noted that it was a bit heavy handed on the cheese.
I ordered the regular salad with the honey mustard vinaigrette. This was a nicely done salad.

For main courses, companion #1 ordered a medium bacon cheeseburger. The burger arrived medium but on the dry side, with barely adequate cheese and decent fries. Companion felt she had had better burgers in most fast food places.
Companion #2 ordered the rib eye steak medium rare. It arrived medium rare, but seemed to be poorly prepped in that it had lots of sinew on it, and the tail still had some silverskin attached. Seasoning was adequate but nothing special.
I had the Ahi tuna appetizer along with the small sirlion. The Ahi was cooked correctly, but had been pre-cooked hours before, and was greatly over-seasoned. By the time you added the wasabi vinaigrette dipping sauce, the fish had no taste left of its own. In paying for a premium fish like Ahi, the fish should be the central character, and the rest of the condiments are the supporting role. The petite sirloin was cooked as ordered (rare), but lacked flavor and again, still had silverskin attached, making the last piece memorable for its chewiness.

We did not order any deserts.

Inspection of the restrooms was pleasant enough, in that they were recently cleaned, smelled fresh, and looked nice.

Overall, I might rate Outback 2.5 to 3 stars. I've definitely had better at lower prices. BTW if you are tempted by the Blossom, their signature onion and your on a diet, companion #1 says stay far away from it. That one dish alone will use up the entire days amount of points!Disappointed. The battered clam strips were great. The snow crab was pretty good. The king crab was pretty bad (it's maybe my favorite food but this was poor enough I didn't even finish it.). The lobster was small and over cooked. Didn't finish it either. 

The kid at the bar that served me was great.After a few successful projects, I was sooooo hopeful that I FINALLY found a printer that was fast, efficient and reasonably priced.  

My hopes were shattered.  

New project: after sending over my info, attachments and needs via email twice, I heard nothing.  Crickets.  After a phone call to them and confirming that they got my email, I heard nothing.  Crickets.  

So next new project: a banner.  Maybe my last experience was a fluke.  Sent over all the info, gave them a call and confirmed they recieved my email.  Again, nothing.  Crickets.  I obviously never had it made there, but I did get an email response 3 weeks later (I'm not exaggerating)  Boo.

I have since found another printer....good help is hard to find and unfortunately, you won't find it here.Be forewarned, this is quite possibly the worst mexican food spot I have ever eaten at! If you enjoy authentic mexican food, don't go here!

The only reason why I'm giving their rating 2 stars versus only 1 star was because our waitress was very polite and serviced us well. The food however was terrible! 

My husband ordered the two cheese enchilada plate, and the enchilada sauce tasted nothing like enchilada sauce! The rice looked like orange pasty mush and the beans tasted like canned beans. I ordered the chicken taco salad and this is the first time I've had cold chicken in my taco salad. I couldn't eat it! The only thing good was the appetizer sampler that we ordered. 

We were the only people there on a Friday afternoon and now I know why! Overall we overpaid for crappy food!Not the best Indian restaurant but it will do!So just came back home from wendys after i ordered a pretzel bun burger with chicken ...open the bag and surprise I got a regular burger with bacon wtf ..really it took just a min to order and get the order and it was not even busy !This review may not accurately portray the resort because it involves a planned event/conference. We stayed here last year during the same period and it was excellent. The grounds are nice - a large, sprawling complex that can be a little confusing at night. Two nice pools, a life size chess site and spacious rooms are all very impressive. The catered meals were great last year and we were able to check into our rooms early. This year, not so much. Our meetings were finished at noon, but the rooms originally would not be ready until 4pm. Later it was changed to 2pm. Some reservations for our group were not made correctly and resulted in issues. When we called about our room the day before check in, there was a long delay in actually reaching someone. The evening of the first night I attempted to place a wakeup call, but no one answered. The food this year was weak. The first day breakfast was a small continental breakfast. Lunch was a house sandwich - slices of bread, deli meat, tomato and lettuce...I would have made that in my refrigerator at home. The swordfish and nice vegetables of last year were replaced with hors d vores this year. It felt like bar food at happy hour. I didn't stay for lunch the next day - it was a sacked lunch with what I heard was a wrap. Dinner was descent with made to order pasta stations, but really it was mostly just the pasta with very little side dishes. Housekeeping was unpredictable. Day 2 it was after 1:00 and they still hadn't been in our room, but Saturday they were knocking on the door at 8:05 am. 

The internet access is $8 per day; the fitness center $15.There were hardly any items in the gift shop, which last year was full.  I know our total bill was high and compared to last year I had high expectations for another great weekend. The resort is in bankruptcy and being auctioned in the next few weeks. Comparing the stay this year to last year, it appeared they were cutting corners. I did not use the spa or the golf course to see how those services compared, but the services such as event planning and housekeeping were a come down from previous years.I once liked to use the salon here to get my hair cut. This however is only my second time at this location I normally go to the one at Desert Ridge for hair cuts but the girl I would see no longer works there so I decided to try the location closer to me.  I did not like the last person who did my hair his name was Guadalupe.  His cut was nice that he did when he finally finished but his attention was everywhere but on me and this made me feel uncomfortable and unimportant so I will not allow him to cut my hair again. 
 He was too concerned about listening to other peoples conversations and what they were doing then to pay attention to me.  He stopped every 5-10 minutes (no joke!!) to get side tracked on something.  My hair cut took over an hour.  I would have understood if he was the only one there but it was slow with other workers to answer the phone and make appointments.  Personally I think he wanted to make sure all the appointment got scheduled with him that is why he would not allow any other worker to answer the phone or help walk ups.   After 30 minutes into the cut and me already getting irritated by his ADHD he decides to talk to the sales person and buy hair sheers. He completely left me sitting there for at least 10+ minutes.  I could hear the sales man say also he could come back or wait till he was done with me.. but NOOOOO Guadalupe felt I was able to just sit there wet head half cut and pissed off.   When he came back and saw my face he said "your mad arent you"  Ya ya think!! 
This was my first hair cut in over a year and my hair had been kept up in a pony tail for the most part for about 3 months because I had a baby.  He says "what have you done to your hair" very rudely.  This was my one treat to myself to try and get the pre-pregnancy self esteem back and have a nice day to myself getting pampered.  I felt like unwanted crud when I left.

I will go back as this was the first bad egg of the stylist I had received.  I will try to schedule on a day he is not there as looking at him will bring out the crabbiness in me!   

After I visit again I will update my view with the next service just to make sure I am giving accurate ratings for the place.We were seated at a table quickly.
We were given a highchair, and I of course, whipped out our daughter's baby wipes, to wipe down the table. (she is teething, so anything she sees, and she's like a bottom fish)

I wish I would have taken a picture, because after I was done wiping, there was my hand print, a dark grey out line on the baby wipe........Are you kidding me?

The girl came around and took our order, we ordered, wedge salad, a prime rib dip, and a burger.

salad came out, it was good. Manager walks around (or at least attempts to) in pretty woman looking boots...Making her rounds, but mostly joking around with staff.

We wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, and wait for our food.

Booties (manager) comes over and asks how we enjoyed our dinner...We then informed her that we hadn't eaten yet.

She goes back and "checks". Waitress, and booties (manager) tell us separately that it will be "one minute", or that it's "next up".

Whatever that means.

Food comes, and it's decent, worth the wait I suppose.

PLEASE, CLEAN YOUR TABLES PROPERLY!My first visit went well, but I returned a second time and was very disappointed. The server tried to be nice but between her non-understandable "accent" and inability to multi-task our breakfast was not a very good experience.There were only 2 of us. One ice tea came in an almost full glass and the other about 3/4 full. Weird! My food came out and maybe 5 minutes later the other food came out. I opened my utensils and there was hardened food all over my knife. Then thirdly my bisquits & gravy came out ice cold. When I sent it back for heating, I also asked for a second plate. The bisquits came back hot, but the plate never arrived. Finally the busboy got it for us. I spoke with the manager and he apologized but I have made my decision about the likelihood of returning there. Maybe they were having a bad day but i was not the only one complaining. Have been to other IHOPs and never experienced this.There's always a lowered level of expectation when dining at a chain restaurant. TGI Fridays can usually be counted on to deliver a tasty, reasonably priced meal. This location fails at that. 

Whereas the menu offerings here promise flavor in the description, the food itself is really quite bland. There is a serious dip in quality from where this chain was just a few years ago. Cheaper ingredients are apparent and even the famed Jack Daniels barbecue sauce has lost it's zip.

Add to the fact that the food was disappointing, the drinks are watered down. I know times are tough and changes are part of the climate, but the prices which once seemed reasonable, now seem too high for the mediocre food.

I would suggest that it's not only the failing economy that is contributing to a nearly empty restaurant at 5:30 on a Saturday evening. There are other chains delivering better food at the same price. Hopefully Fridays gets back on track.We stayed on a Monday night for $30.23 (Used a Groupon deal 15.68/night and 14.55 resort fee) It also came with a coupon book.

- Not very many people come here apparently. We got parking right next to the hotel!
- Upon check in, the black guy at front desk says, "so are you gonna be like him and give me a hard time too? Complain about the $100 deposit!" LOL. "You know I ain't got my readers on, Go head and read me your address!" Come on now...
- "Oh no more king rooms available. I'll put you in 2 queens." WTF.
- Coupon book came with 1 play of free bowling. $3.75 for shoe rental. 
- Horrible fitness center. 2 treadmills but only one working. The tread of the one that is working is coming apart! fail. 
- Hotel room like Palace Station. 3 Star. Great view of a wall! YAY! 
- I agree with Tera, I have ATT and had poor reception at the hotel. 
- Don't play blackjack here. 6:5 6 deck. boo. 
- We ate the Grand Cafe at midnight and got the $1.99 special. Great value.I totally dug the enterior but that is where it stopped. The rolls all pretty much were the same rolls on the menu,but named different things,looked the same when they came out and were WAY over priced. I live downtown Vegas and drove here because I was on a date, I think I would be much better off at an all you can eat sushi joint on Flamingo,rather than drive to Timbucktoo and pay out the butt for mediocre sushi. The sushi chefs however were very entertaining while chugging booze with the people at the sushi bar and making everyones sushi. That was a plus with the entertainment there.Was good car wash up until the summer of 2012 - last four times there has been either no wax and/or no soap - Management does not keep the hours listed as available for on-site help. Generally clean, but poor oversight of equipment - vending machines rarely operate and one out of three times you actually get the products (I.e. Towels, etc.) you paid for.The pho's a bit pricey and they're very short on selection variety. And it's even worse because the size of the pho was tiny. I needed a magnifying glass to see it! Just kidding. But you get what I mean.

It was edible and okay at the least,

The wait's long and it's super crowded.

Would I come back? Nah. I'll try the other pho places around Vegas, if I ever come back.Our server barrel spoke English, which made ordering and asking about menu items difficult. We asked about the clay pot dishes, and all he could tell us was that it took 30 minutes to make and that we wouldn't like it. Jason HATES when people.. ahem me.. tell him he won't like it, and he would have ordered it but was too hungry to wait.

Calamari: DELICIOUS! Definitely the highlight of the meal- garlic covered fried calamari. YUM!
Seafood Sizzler Platter: BLAND!!! This was one of the most expensive dishes on the menu, and I was so disappointed by how bland it was. There was more calamari than anything else (a bummer after we split a huge appetizer of calamari). I didn't finish the plate, and didn't bother taking it home. That says a lot. 
Pork-Bowl Thing (Jason ordered it by photo): The pork was really good, but the rest of the bowl lacked creativity. He wasn't a fan of how much salad was in the bowl, and the sauce was bland. 

Upon leaving, I asked the server if they accepted AmEx, he told me yes so I left my card with Jason before I went to the restroom. When I came back, I was told that they don't accept American Express, just "regular cards". Huh? Again, language barrier. Frustrating.

PROS:
Calamari was good

CONS:
Language barrier
Service unhelpful
No checkup on how food was
Bland food

All in all, I definitely won't be backFirst of all i love Einstein Bros and i go to the Henderson location all the time, Now the only reason why i gave this location 2 stars instead 1 is because of the awesome bagels and darn good coffee sold from this fine establishment. 

Now for my complaints. I have been here twice in the morning for coffee and had to wait in line for sometime, not because the place was busy and crowded but for the POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE. There must have been 5 employees behind the counter working on other things and not paying attention or IGNORING the customers waiting in line to place an order. There was only 1 person taking orders and ringing customers up after who had lackluster customer service because he/she was rushing and that was a big reason for the pile up. This happened to me the first time i was there, I thought things would change when i came there the second time but nothing changed. I'll go to a different location next time..I came here at 1:30 am because my goto spot was closed. Place was just ok. The spring rolls we're standard. The peanut sauce they we're served with was runny and when I tasted it tastedlike rotten eggs. I don't use much of it anyways, so it I didn't make a big deal of it. Whatever it was, it had gone bad.

The Pho was just ok. Not the best, not the worst.

I probably won't be back.Stop by here for dinner. We ordered the roast duck and wonton noodle soup, soya sauce chicken and BBQ pork over rice, and Singapore noodle. Singapore noodle was ok, but found the curry wasn't mixed well, portion was spicier than other. The noodle soup and rice was decent. Service was typical, server was little pushy in taking our order. I would stick with the BBQ items here.Do they have good Boba? Yes

Is it overpriced? Yes

Are they rude? Yes and yes

Two stars for the fact that it is good boba but it is a pain to get it and you pay a lot for it.This location is MAD ghetto-ish... from most of the customers to the people who work there.  I mean, sure, it isn't located in Beverly Hills, but come on!  I actually love Target, usually, but this place is definitely an exception.  It is still a step above Walmart, but not much above... like a half-step.  If there's another Target close to where you live or work, then I suggest you go there.  Unless, of course, you like the ghetto--then feel free to come here because you'll love it.Went shopping here on the way out of town after visiting Vegas, looking for a men's wedding band for my fiance.  Worked with Karen.  Found one we both liked, but when I asked for a certificate for the diamonds, she poo-poo'd me and said for the small diamonds like those in the ring, they didn't offer any certificates.  I thought this sounded odd, as I have other small diamonds with certificates, and maybe we should have stopped and left then, but we liked the ring.  So, she quoted us a price of $488 and we bought it.  The day after, I was surfing the net and found the SAME RING on the Ultra diamond website for $329!  I called and Karen's first response was 'there's nothing I can do."  I told her it seemed like it should be easy for them to credit my credit card for the difference, or we could always return it in CA.  She then spoke to someone else, and took my credit card information and said the manager, Larry, would credit my account.  It took a week, but they did end up refunding me the difference between the prices (so I gave them two stars instead of one).  Also, I noted on the original receipt, not only did they happily over-charge us for the ring, they added in a $50 'protection' plan.  They said that was 'free', but never mentioned it as an option we could decline, or offered to take it off the over-inflated price.  I can't say I recommend them, based on the above experiences.If you're looking for a quick bite while at the North Outlets, then this would be a pretty good choice - but I wouldn't add it to my rotation by any means. I got a slice of the veggie which came stacked high with broccoli (I know, broccoli on a pizza!! :D), tomatoes, black olives and cheese. Because the fresh ingredients had been sitting there for so long that they had to re-heat my piece before serving it to me, the crust was completely soggy, I had to attempt to eat it with a fork and knife. The flavors worked nicely, but the texture was all off. My husband got a slice of pepperoni and was happy with it, but he would eat anything shy of cardboard. 

The beautiful garlic bread was quite intriguing, maybe we'll give it a try next time around, but I won't spring for a slice again.Came here for pizza hut pizza. This taco bell doesn't not sell pizza. Some-how due to not being able to use the bathroom, I decide to order some fast food. I order the nachos grande or whatever you call it. Boy I haven't being here in years and I guessed it showed. These nachos only had cheese, sour cream, chicken, and beans. So I had to add extra toppings. Yelp 20 mins later- taco bell did it's job-I am now sitting on the toilet  writing this review and boy I am happy that I am to use the restroom.The view and atmosphere are always nice, although the food is just average.  I've been several times since the new owners have taken over, and it has been disappointing every time.  The typical brasserie food is completely overprice, and the portions seem to keep getting smaller.  The entree of muscles is less then half of what it used to be, and the french fries are not as good.  I was hoping this local establishment was getting better, but clearly that is not the case.  Sadly, we won't be back! 

BTW, there was a wedding party on the terrace there as well.  The constant passing of guests was quite irritating.  In addition, there was live music and the regular restaurant music playing simultaneously.  This ruined the tranquil setting!  Even our waiter was embarrassed!Had the Singapore noodles and the potstickers. The potstickers were pretty good-- a mixture of deep fried/pan-fried with a small amount of meat and vegetables inside. Relatively thick dumpling skin compared to filling. 

Singapore noodles were a total waste. Considering that this was a "specialty" of theirs, I was hoping that this dish would be of decent quality but it just lacked flavor and  diversity in ingredients. Four shrimp and maybe two ounces of chicken along with chewy noodles that were not seasoned. Very disappointing and pricey as well.stopped here for some studying, so i was looking for a solid cup of coffee that would keep me going. what i got: watery "coffee" that didn't taste good or give me that buzz i was looking for. meh at best for the product, but the atmosphere was nice.I have to echo the previous criticisms.  We had some similar problems.  They were more concerned about getting a contract signed instead of finding way to provide the services we desire.
We were under threat of being laid off and I asked them to put my payments on hold or allow me a buy out.  They would not agree to anything.  So we paid our last required payments and never went back.  They got their few hundred dollars but lost a lifelong customer.  Was it worth it?
The pool was nice and some of the treadmills were good.   We had to compete sometimes to get on some of the machines.
Interesting to hear about the religious influence here and the lack of yoga classes.  I hadn't heard that.  very weird.
I would consider a different club.After 6 years as a member, my membership expired a couple of months ago and no one noticed at the Y.  I guess that's ok, as the number of classes convenient to me keeps shrinking, the number of machines decreased, and the amount of space taken up for personal training/TRX machines makes the rest of the exercise rooms croweded.  The gym downstairs is crowded and messy.  I feel sad about this; this was "my Y" for years.  

I am going to look into the other fitness centers in downtown.  I also feel sad as I love to support the Y.  But this particular one is not up to standard.  I hope this gets read, unlike the suggestions I put into the suggestion box over the last year.  Mmmm...maybe the Y doesn't want me anymore.The Denny's at this location has outstanding cooks. Everything is always nicely cooked and hot, I love the skillets. The problem is with the service, the only consistancy is that it is terrible. My observation is not on one experience or two, it is the last four out of the last five times we have been there, no coffee refills, no to go boxes, we waited and waited for ANY service to the point the server in the next section finally helped us. Management needs step up the service.Does it really have 2 come 2 this ?

WHN first impressions of staff n Doctor care or lack of don't impress, an ailing patient should follow their gut ( or aches, nerve pains ) n look elsewhere.

Despite formal complaint filed, and second, third, fourth chances given, sadly this RHEUTMATOID clinic has done nothing but disappoint a family or 2.

Brain FREEZE!  How in the world can such a renowned ;my beloved Catholic medical institution not follow up accordingly w their sick,  fail to schedule timely, necessary physical rx appointments , n abruptly stop meds without proper Doctor weaning instructions? Some Hve said....our pets receive more professional care. 
Does it really Hve 2 come 2 this?

We confess this w deep regret however now hold great HOPE  that things MUST change 4 the better !

PRACTICE compassionate medicine; STOP neglect, n watch - b inspired by "the Doctor" MOVIE in case we ever forget.

Luv,
JC n His earthily AngelsAlright, I should never review while mad, but this meal pissed me off to no end.  

This is your standard Gyro place with the same bulk processed lamb and beef on a stick you get at every Gyro place in Phoenix and the rest of the country.  

It's all made in the same factory in Chicago or wherever it is.  That said, I don't mind it, it tastes fine if it's roasted on the cooker.  I like it.

Well, the front help was nice and the cook nodded hello.  All was good.  People were nice.

 Ordered a gryo salad to go.  Paid and left.

First issue, they did not slice my meat off of the cooker, it was put from some container onto the grill.  This pisses me off.  I want crispy edges not some wonder meat from yesterday.

Lastly, since I got it to go, I didn't see my result until miles away.

2+ cups of dressing on my salad.  I kid you not.  I COULD NOT SEE THE MEAT OR SALAD.  

What the heck was the cook thinking?  I had more dressing than meat and salad.  I am NOT joking.

And it wasn't even tsasiki sauce just some substandard yuck from likely a giant bucket.

Note to self:  Do not order gyros from place that doesn't slice fresh.  Always get dressing on side.  Don't eat here.One night during my visit to Arizona, I was extremely hungry and craving sushi. Dining at traditional sushi restaurants was not an option ($$$$). I searched all over town for AYCE sushi and Sushi Q was the only restaurant that Yelp returned within Chandler, Mesa, Tempe, Phoenix, and Scottsdale. I jumped into my car and quickly roared out to Sushi Q at around 7:00pm. Sushi Q is located in a strip mall next to a seedy liquor store. When I arrived during happy hour, there were only 3 people in the restaurant! There's no need to beat the dinner rush here. 

I sat at the bar and designated myself as an AYCE customer. After perusing the order menu, I was upset to discover an 8 order limit on the nigiri. 8 orders = 16 pieces. When I eat AYCE sushi in California, I typically average ~50 pieces, with a personal record of 64. Nobody cares how much you order in California, as long as you don't throw up on premises. Apparently not the case in stingy Arizona.

The nigiri menu is sparse with limitations to the basic fish. Uni was not an option on the menu. Neither were any premium fish (not even off the AYCE menu). I ordered the standard choices: albacore, mackerel, red snapper, tuna, salmon, shrimp, scallop, and yellowtail. The rice was served at room temperature as it should be. The fish quality of the tuna, salmon, and red snapper was acceptable, but the presentation for the other sushi was poor. Excessive ponzu sauce and green onions were applied on top of the yellowtail, mackerel, and albacore, to the point where I could not taste the distinct flavor of each fish. See photos for the sloppy preparation and the overuse of onions. The quality was disappointing even for a Korean sushi chef.

For economic purposes, Sushi Q expects AYCE customers to fill up on appetizers and rolls rather than the fish. I feared leaving with a half full stomach, so I ordered rolls and appetizers after the nigiri. Rolls do not have order limits, but premium rolls were strategically removed from the AYCE menu. I asked for the negi salmon roll, yellowtail roll, and rainboll roll. The rolls were handled by a Hispanic sushi chef. The rainbow roll was standard, although the rice was a bit stiff. Yellowtail roll was a salty disaster, with excessive garlic/chili sauce drenched over the fish that spread to the rice. Fortunately, the negi salmon roll was acceptable with minimal sauces used and generous amount of salmon in each piece.
 
Be aware that appetizers are full orders. I ordered agedashi tofu expecting just a few pieces of hot tofu. Instead, I received a basket full of fried tofu enough to feed a family of 3. The agedashi tofu was a joke. It was supposed to be served in a broth with Katsuobushi, Japanese onions, some rice wine, and soy sauce, but all that was given was a bowl of soy sauce separated from the tofu.

In the end, I left with a full stomach but was dissatisfied with the quality of food consumed. I came to eat sushi but was instead instructed to order mediocre rolls engulfed in puddles of assorted sauces. The 16 piece limit is a severe limitation that renders the AYCE option as not cost-effective ($23.95 for dinner).This place is nothing like it used to be. It used to be one of my favorite places to go for sushi but now I can honestly say I will not be returning. The sushi was very generic and was pretty much like the rolls you would get at a buffet. Don't pay attention to what is listed on their website. That is the old menu and they don't serve majority of the things listed anymore. I am very disappointed in this place. Took my friend to show her how great it was wand it's totally different and nothing close to how nice it used to be.Ok, when I feel like having fast food and maybe include a fish taco or something, this is a place that comes to mind. I've made the drive here many times but honestly, their service is horrible lately. You can be the only one in line and they'll forget numerous items! It's gotten so bad that I've actually made an effort to contact corporate about it and have received no response. Seems like it's not a big deal but in the past 6-8 months I've given them many chances and have been disappointed 8 times out of 10. We'll see if they make any changes...as for now, it's true mexican food at one of the 'berto's for me...Meet up with some friends Sat night to have some dinner before I painted the town red, we all had decided on going to Garcia's, meet up time was 7pm, and were a group of 10 or more, and we didn't have wait long to be seated, which was nice.

I wanted to try something different this time, I normally do burritos or beef tacos, but I am trying to eat just a little bit healthier and lose some weight, so I decided to try the Grilled Fish Tacos

I told our waiter what I wanted, and on the menu it says your choice of beans, refried, churro, or black, our waiter didn't even ask, and to be honest I am ok with whatever showed up on my plate. Now the menu description was Two corn tortillas with grilled tilapia, tomatillo mayonnaise, shredded cabbage, pico de gallo, and cilantro. Served with a side of salsa de piña,  that right their got me craving the salsa of pina, which in my white girl head flipped it to pineapple salsa, man doesn't that sound delish and I was so sure that it would go so well with grilled tilapia, like how mango salsa is grilled chickens best friend. But guess what, I couldn't tell you, it never showed up, the one thing I was looking for and it didn't show up, was super bummed. The type beans I wound up were charro, like I said I was easy going on that part. The grilled talapia lacked flavor too, it was sort of bland.

I understand that it was a Sat night and we were a big group and the place was busy, but I had to flag out waiter down to even ask for our checks, he just kept disappearing, and wasn't very attentive, never once asked any of us if our meals were ok, just sort of gave us our plates and left and just ignored our table, so I never even got the chance to ask for the salsa de pina. Saw his tip was already included on the bill since we were a big party, which I expected, but I just don't like when the tip is already added and the server didn't really do anything to earn it, but its part of the going out and eating beast, sometimes service is spot on or better and sometimes we get treated like the red headed step child.  One of my friends even had food fall of the plate down her back when he was picking up our plates and never once did he say sorry.   Wouldn't blame her if she didn't want to go back.After lasting one night in that spooky L Motel where strippers go to die- I was idiotic enough to take a referral to eat here. But I always give second chances, and this one failed.

The place was crowded on Monday morning (labor day). 

The water was dirty and delayed to arrive at the table.

The table was dirty, and the silverware and napkins were absent. 

The food was horrendous, and the eggs seemed like they'd been soaked in water after being scrambled. 

The fruit bowl consisted of one grape, and two or three slimy melons. 

We sat but did not eat. Paid the bill and sought refuge in Safeway's deli. 

When you're passing through town, get thee to the grocery. 

Waitress was super nice though, it wasn't her fault the meal was awful or the place was dirty.The kiddo wanted to go here for some pizza and games so we went. I have to say this new location is nice inside. The arcade at the old location was bigger. I used to love peter piper pizza when I was a kid. I think it was the cornmeal on the bottom, gave it that crunch. I was disappointed that our pizza didn't have that this time. The boneless wings were good and the pizza was OK, but the kiddo had a great time winning tickets to get a toy at the counter and she ate all her pizza. So mission accomplished. All about the kiddo!!! She's happy and were happy. When we were leaving there was a large group of thug like teenagers and there little group of girls and the were intentionally getting in our way and making it difficult to get out the door and get to our car. I forgot i was at Ghetto-Center. One kid had his pants on to his knees then two other pairs of shorts above that then his boxers sticking out above that. lol There is no way he looks in the mirror and says I look good. Anyway fun for the kid but I don't like the Ghetto-Center area so probably wont be taking the kiddo back there again.Food is mediocre at best.  The place was filthy, covered in a layer of dust.  They don't take credit cards and force you to use the $5 ATM.

I'd give it one star, but that just feels mean.BROW SERVICES  WERE FIVE STAR!!!!!!
Nail service 1 star or less!!!!!!!
  
I bought a Groupon for three gel manis and pedis.  The Brow Lady is next to one of our favorite wine bars, so I thought that would work out great---park DH at Evo's, go get girly, then get treated to a nice dinner.  I made the appointment for the mani/pedi, then looking at my unruly brows, added on a brow shaping/wax.  I arrived at the The Brow Lady---receptionist was a nice young girl, and within moments I was greeted by Brandi, the Brow Artist.  I was with her for about 30 minutes.  She was wonderful.  Really warm, personable, professional.  She did a super job on my brows---gave a little more up-to-date shape, cleaned up all those "downies" (as she called them).  I was loving her.  She mentioned she does reflexology---so now I am really excited.  I am envisioning making monthly appointments, getting my brows tidied, my nails done, my feet rubbed.  Followed by a nice dinner and a glass of wine.  Does it get any better?  I work hard and a lot of hours, I cherish the rare hours I get to pamper myself.

For the service, Brandi had to remove the color I had penciled in on my brows, and after, she offered to fill it back in because who wants to go to dinner with pale brows?  I really liked the color pencil she used and how nicely it blended, so I ended up buying one.  In fact, I was eyeing their whole make-up bar wondering if it wasn't time I did a cosmetic update....  I know---I am a product slut.

Suffice to say, I was TOTALLY HAPPY with Brandi and her skill and customer service and I could easily have made her my "go-to" for brow care.  But...

I do want to mention this----I am a really good tipper.  And I ALWAYS tip full price on a Groupon, because I don't think the service person should have to suffer because I have a coupon.  And I was very happy with Brandi, so I tipped her 25%.

Then she passed me on to the nail tech...who did not speak to me, did not make eye contact, carried on slightly inappropriate conversation with the other nail techs and ignored me and obviously was not listening when I told her how I liked my nails shaped, overwhelmed me first with music from a laptop and then her cell phone (I like Alicia Keyes and Beyonce, but not full blast 18 inches from my ears!), made me writhe into awkward positions to get my fingertips under the uv light rather than arrange the work service so I could do it easily, got defensive and a little rude when she clipped my nails too short to shape them the way I like (I TOLD you before you started!), had bright red polish all over the skin at the sides of my nails and the finish of the nail was not smooth and mirror-like, but had ripples and divots.  I was so upset that when she made a shooing motion toward the pedi-chair and said: Go sit there, I told her no, I am skipping the pedi.  I wasn't going to let her do a thing further to me.  I already had a half-assed gel manicure that will cost me $10-$20 to get stripped.  Then when I went to check out---pay for the brow wax and pencil---receptionist asked if I wanted to leave a gratuity for Brandi and Ashley (that's when I found out nail tech's name).  TG I had already given Brandi her tip.  And for the first time ever---DH couldn't believe it when I told him-- I didn't leave even a single cent of tip for that  unprofessional, inept girl---that's how upset I was.  My few hours of pampering ended very badly.  And I will never set foot in the place again, so I have lost the money I spent on the Groupon.

You may wonder why I won't go there if I liked Brandi so much.  How do I know her and that nasty girl aren't BFF's?  Would you put your precious brows in the hands of someone who might have a vendetta against you for dissing her friend?  Plus, now I just have a bad taste in my mouth for the whole establishment.  But in my opinion, Brandi should be working at one of the high-end spas----she has the personality and skill and customer service.  It's a shame she is wasted on a poorly managed place like The Brow Lady---and I say poorly managed, because I certainly would not stand for an employee providing the kind of service that Ashley did, and I wasn't impressed by the behavior of any of the techs.  So I was really torn on how to rate my experience---I tried to cut it down the middle, but as they say---treat a customer right, they'll tell two people---treat a customer wrong, and they'll tell a hundred.McDs is what it is...but this one has about a 50% success rate on getting the order right.This morning was my first time at Arcadia Farms. 
The Good:
Julia, our server was super sweet.  We got to sit out on the back patio which was full of umbrellas so there was plenty of shade on a beautiful day.  I ordered the French Toast that came with chicken apple sausage, it was decent, but cold as you will see why as you continue reading. 
The Not So Good:
One of the gals in our party ordered a veggie sandwich off the lunch menu and it was explained to us that she would get her meal a few minutes after the rest of us who ordered breakfast.  I guess if we wanted breakfast we had to order before 11 and after that is when the lunch menu kicks in. So we all gave our order just at 11.  We all received our meals and since the gal who ordered a veggie sandwich was going to get hers a few minutes later, I waited to start eating until she got hers. Well, 10 min went by and nothing, was told it should be any second. 30 minutes went by and she still had not received her VEGGIE sandwich.  I started eating my cold food which I guess is my fault that I waited for the other gal to get her VEGGIE sandwich, was just trying to be polite.  I saw plenty of other people who sat down after 11:00 that got their sandwiches. An hour and 10 minutes went by ....no VEGGIE sandwich.  We called Julia over and told her to cancel the veggie sandwich.  Either the manager overheard it or Julia had told him what was going on cause he finally came by and said he was sorry and that it was coming out.  The gal who ordered it said she didn't want to wait for it. The manager said he would take care of it and get it for her to go.  In addition to this, one of the omelets that came to the table had a long black hair cooked into it.  She sent it back, of course and she got another one.  The manager did not come to the table and talk about the hair omelet and nothing was done with her bill.
The Good (cont.):
Julia, again, was very sweet and apologetic about the sandwich not coming out.  We kept telling her it was not her fault cause she's not in the kitchen making the food.  She did offer some bread and butter to our foodless friend but she said no thanks. Julia  did bring some "peace offering" scones so she had something to eat. That was very nice of her to do that.  She also was nice enough to do separate checks for 6 of us. 

I'm not sure if I will go back.  I really don't know why a veggie sandwich took an hour and 15 minutes. Nothing was grilled or cooked on this. Should not have taken that long.  The hair in the omelet, it happens but it should have been discovered before it got to the table, the hair was smack in the middle on top of the omelet. 
If I decide to give them a second try, I do hope Julia is my server. 

I'd give 5 stars to Julia and the atmosphere. 1 star for the food and experience.I really wanted to like this place but...They need to hire more help especially when they know they will be busy.  We sat outside and waited a good 20 minutes before anyone came over to greet us, then the waitress did not have time for us, since we were asking questions of the menu and not fully prepared to order she kept saying I will come back.  we did not know her name, but they definitely needed more help as she was the only waitress outside for over 10 tables.  She was surprised we did not want an appetizer and she was not well informed about the food and what was and was not organic.  After we ordered our food people came in after us and got there food before we did, we waited over 45 minutes for our food and it was nothing to write home about.  My chicken and mushroom leeks came out a bit cold, but I refrained from sending it back because I did not want to wait another 45 minutes.  They did comp us a dessert which are not worth $7.00,,,If the service had been better, and the wait staff had took the time to care maybe it would have been better.  The ambiance was nice sitting outside with the little birds flying over head.Maybe I'm a Mexican-food snob, but this was basically overpriced-Del Taco fare.
The food was nothing to write home about. It was served on Styrofoam plates and the customer service was lacking.Update: The first 5 or 6 times I ate at Uncle Sal's it was amazing. However, it has gotten worse and worse since then. On our most recent visit (on a Tuesday night) it was pretty busy. After being ignored at the hostess stand for what felt like 5 minutes, I was finally told it would be "about 15 minutes" for a table for two. After 45 minutes to an hour, and after every other group of people who came in after us were seated, we were finally seated in that "oh, shit, I forgot to seat these people who have been waiting way too long that even though I wrote their name down on the list I seemed to keep skipping over them for no apparent reason". It was uncomfortable.
We were finally sat in the back section of the restaurant where there were a good 5 or 6 open tables around us. After waiting 10 minutes for our flustered waitress (who never apologized for the wait or introduced herself) to finally come over, she asked if we were ready to order our food yet. Didn't tell us any specials, didn't ask if we have any questions, didn't even give us a chance to order a bottle of wine... We saw her one more time the rest of the night when she brought our check with out even thanking us. 
Oh, and the food was disgusting on that night. My pene vodka tasted like frozen Michelana's, and my boyfriends shrimp fettucini alfredo was inedible. The shrimp were so over cooked they were hard and crunchy, and the alfredo sauce was so tastless and heavy it gave us both a stomach ache. At this point I was so annoyed I didn't even have the energy to complain to the arrogant host/manager that forgot about us for an hour. 
Hopefully in the summer time it will have slowed down a bit and they will get their shit together. They obviously don't operate well when they're busy. It was like being on Gordon Ramsey's Kitchen NightmaresI was not happy with the service department.  Service writer had a poor attitude towards helping me.  Repair work was done well and on budget but it is sad how a greeter can sour you on the whole place.There are much better places for breakfast.  Sorry.I visited this location a couple weeks ago with some friends, since I had heard good things about RA. My initial impression of the place was pretty good. I liked the decor of the restaurant, and the loud atmosphere is what I was looking for (I mean, Mill Ave on a Friday night...seriously). 

As far as the service goes, it was decent. I wasn't impressed with the waiter, but I wasn't thrown into a fit of rage either. So, you know, props. With how busy it was, I wasn't expecting the world's best wait staff anyway.

And then there's the food. One friend and I had various pieces of sushi, which were extremely average. Like, if you could grade this sushi with a C, it would be the largest possible C you could give. And for the high price point, this is really a turn off. My other friend had some kind of mushroom-based soup that was pretty fantastic, though. I regret not buying cauldrons full of the soup.I'm not sure how this place has a 4.5 star average rating.  The beer is solid.  The brewery atmosphere is standard.  The night I was there it had a lot of screaming kids running around.  The food is not a reason to go there.  We ordered their most popular items and they were nothing special.Rosita's
tisk tisk
there is nothing to really say 
it's not even that rosita's is bad, it's ...well...i guess i expected more on account of it's lifespan. The food here is mediocre, the service slow but friendly enough, and the ambience is purely no frills. I can't think of one single aspect of Rosita's which could distinguish it from the million other restaurants just like it scattered all thoughout our metropolis of strip malls like so much pollen in the wind. The only reason it gets 2 stars is cause i hate giving a bad review, and it's a local buisness and you gotta support your rootsmmhmm....strictly average. We ordered bruschettas for appetizers and they were so disappointing. The bread was soggy and the dip was inedible. The whole dish was LIBERALLY laced with some sour condiment, like tamarind juice! We were really hungry so we ate it all up.
 
For the main course I got chicken souvlaki and my friend got the gyro dinner. My souvlaki was good (nothing outstanding). The chicken wasn't dry. It came wrapped with a decent amount of veggies in a falafel. I got a huge side of crispy fries. They were supposed to be seasoned...but I couldn't make out any seasoning. 

My friend's dish was huge. He got deliciously done lamb and beef strips with a side of mildly seasoned rice and steamed veggies. He also got a side of potatoes, which I thought should have been cut smaller and cooked better. My friend discarded them anyway because of the carbs!
One saving grace: our server definitely had some Greek looks :) Just wish he smiled a bit more!From the outside this place looks like all fun and games.  $2 beer, a party atmosphere and free food during happy hour.  Whats not to like right?  Unfortunately the music is way 2 loud when you get in.  Its really difficult to have a conversation.  The free food has made me sick on more than 1 occasion.  The service is slow to the point that I usually go to the bar to order a beer.  I would give this place at least 3 stars if they turned down the music a couple of notches.I am now aware of the fact that they do not charge covers on the weekends...

This being the case, I could now possibly see myself dropping by for one cocktail on a Mill avenue binge session, but just one.Ordered pad thai chicken med spicy.  The portions are too big could have easily split it.  Cut the portions down and reduce the price.  It was dry and really spicy for medium.  Also the noodles tasted like they were cooked in tap water, had a weird taste.  Disappointed for sure.  I will not go back.  Quality over quantity please!  This place is all about big mediocre portions.I feel like I'm writing several negative reviews, but maybe I was just unlucky with my choices?

Drinks - I had a nice white wine I cannot remember the name of, but it did the job.
Food - I had maybe two bites due to chatting with my pals, but ended up leaving the leftovers on the table since it didn't really do much for me. Maybe I order poorly, but my pasta was lame.
Service - Waitress with an attitude and waiter that walked around with an aloof expression on his face. Neither were very attentive to our group of 13+.
Ambiance - I'm confused... We're in Tempe... a land-locked state, correct? Oysters? At an Irish pub? Really? Like I said, confusing!I live close to this place and I love burritos, so I thought this place could be a Wonderful match. Instead, I'm a more die hard qdoba guy than ever. These burritos were sub par, the prices were a bit much, and service was poor. I am a big supporter of local businesses but I won't support mediocrity. I'll pay more for quality, not to stick it to the man.My wife and I have been going  there for 26 yrs. Has always been great. However, the  last several times dining wasn't what we expected. The beans for some reason have been changed and lost the authentic taste. The hot salsa wasn't as hot or tasty either. 
 We have always raved to our friends and relatives about Pedro's but not now until we try it again. Seems like garnish etc. has been cut back. Large portions without the taste is just that a large portion!!Ordered a blizzard at the drive thru. They put lids in everything at this location and put the entire order in a bag, so you don't see your ice cream until you have left the window. My blizzard was underfilled, and runny, and not what I ordered.My husband and I saw that this place had a salad bar, so we decided to try it out.
Once we we seated our waiter came and took our drink order, and brought them to us. We sat there for about 5 mins while he was cleaning two other tables, the place was not busy and we had our menus closed just waiting for him to take our order.. Very annoying.  Finally I asked the hostess as she walked by who our waiter was we were ready to order. It was the same guy who took our drink order and taking his time cleaning tables instead of taking care of his customers. He took our orders and I asked for the check and boxes right away as I could tell he would be slow. He told us we could not get boxes cause we got the salad bar, I clarified that we were not using the boxes for the salad, he said those were the rules. Our food came quickly and it was all good, though he never asked. When we were finishing eating he asked if we could please hurry and sign so he could go home. We will never go back. Unfourtunatley the service is always awful in the sun city area.Perhaps we caught them on a bad day. I called at 8:00 am when they opened. No reservations...first come first serve. I told the attendant I would be stopping by at 10:30 to reserve for 11. Drove 45 minutes to get there to find that he was now leaving from 11:30 to 11:45 and that we wouldn't be able to get a boat until twelve. We returned at twelve to a huge line. They had two other boats in the docks but one had a bad prop and the other leaked. So now it would be 1:15. We left. Three disappointed kids.  The only credit I can give is that it may have been this attendants worst day ever. He was very apologetic but it also seemed like he was set up to fail. Next time, we are going to reserve boats at lake mead.Where to start... the decor is atrocious, the place just looks like it's going to be bad. The service was mediocre and there was a waitress eating in front of me which I find tacky. The food was ok... just ok... barely ok.So I work in the area and have been going there for several years. The food is hands down amazing in my opinion. Here's the problem I have, the service is terrible at lunch. I know they are packed and have never sat down to eat. Always call in and pick up. Over the last year or so my order has been screwed up several times. When I walk in I'm asked how many, I tell them pick up. Then it goes downhill from there. I stand in that crowded little room and I get ignored for the next 15 to 20 mins while I dance out of peoples way. After I called ahead at least 20 mins. giving them a total of 40 mins to prep the food. Then I started calling in at 11:30, no better..
Unfortunately, I dread going there now as it has happened at least 5 times to me.. So I dream of the food and sadly make another choice. Yes, I have talked to them about it. I think they are just overwhelmed at lunchtime.**Hotel and Restaurant review**


"There are cockroaches everywhere its the desert."
"Our system had a virus, so it charged your deposit twice." (two different amounts.)

We got there and the first thing I noticed about my room was the stains on the sheets. The second thing I noticed was the cockroach on the wall of the bathroom. I just got in and I was tired and I thought "well, whatever. I'll sleep in my clothes and tell the manager in the morning." So that's what I did. I woke up the next day to shower and complain, and there was soap in the shower. Used soap. Used soap that wasn't' mine, in the shower. 

I went and told the supervisor on duty and he told me "This is the desert. there are cockroaches everywhere." Uh, OK. It was only one, and I'm a push over. Then he told me "go ahead and enjoy a free meal at Dupars. Just charge it to your room. I'll have housekeeping go to your room first." It was breakfast and I was hungry so that sounded like the perfect solution. 

So we sat down at the table and ordered a sprite and a coffee. The sprite had no syrup in it, so I explained the issue and asked for a water. My fiance got a coffee. When he poured the creamer into his coffee there was trash in the creamer. I can't say that OBVIOUSLY this creamer was at someone elses table at one point, but I'm going to toss that out there as a high possibility. We complained to the waitress and asked for a new coffee. She tried to charge us for 2 coffees. 

Anyway, we fixed our bill (just in case) and charged it to the room. So far so good, I just got back yesterday. I still haven't' received my deposits back, so we'll see how that goes.

A few other things that bothered me, but not enough to have their own paragraphs: The TV didn't work the whole time we were there and I had a horrible view.

So why 2 stars? The front desk girls seemed to care about everything I brought to them. Good customer service in that sense. 

It seems like they put all their good people over at The D down the street, also owned by the same guy I guess. I have no intention of staying here again. Maybe I can find a place downtown that doesn't' have cockroaches?My boyfriend and I went for the 2012-13 New Years - on a spur of the moment trip.  That being said, our prices of $59-89/night was pretty darn good(military rates)! With those prices, however, came a pretty dingy room that didn't come with a clean bathroom.  The toilet seat was stained (paint stains, and it looked disgusting although it was probably clean) and looked so gross, and there was hair on the counter when we got there.

On one hand, for the prices we got and for 0 planning, we got a pretty good deal. On the other, next time I'll pay a little more for a better room - even though we were hardly in it. We spent the extra money losing at Blackjack - but had a GREAT time at that! Would I do it again if needed? Yes, you can't beat that price - especially on New Years.Its a pawn shop. Nothing special, just over priced. But when I was looking to sell an item, the guy helping me was a jerk. Flat out. I was shocked when he was so rude! Sheesh! Ill watch it on tv but sure as hell wont go back!This buffet needs to be updated. I have been going to Main Street Hotel and Casino for about 15 years. The only thing I really love about the place is the microbrews. 
I went to the buffet last night and it was $12.99 with your players card. The line was long. Took about 20 minutes to get seated. 
The food is basically the same stuff they have been serving for the last 15 years I have been going there. Everything is average at best. The food is very fatty and not the choicest cuts of meat. I spent more time waiting in line to eat than I actually did eating. The service sucked. I got one drink (and it was completely full of ice) and no refills. 
Step up the quality of food Main Street. I am no longer eating there again!Disclaimer: I've been a HUGE Apple fan years before Apple was cool. I love most everything Apple makes, and that includes Apple stores. But as the saying goes, "all it takes is one bad apple..."

A friend of mine (DD) and I went to this store to return an AirPort Express a couple days before her 30 day return window expired and had a terrible experience.

DD isn't tech-savvy, per se. She bought the AirPort in Philly (about 3 hours from her house) and couldn't make it work. Since we were going to be in LV, she brought it with her to return it at a Vegas Apple store. First day we went to Fashion Show mall (without the AirPort), found the Apple store, and DD asked an employee about it. He looked up the purchase on his hand-held device, found the transaction, and told her no problem, bring it back the next day. So far so good.

On our next visit we walked up to the first employee we saw near the front door (short guy with dark rim glasses). DD took the AirPort out of her purse and asked about the return. The Apple guy asked for a receipt and DD told him it had been emailed. He glanced at his hand-held device and said 'it's not there'. He could find a prior iPad purchase, but no AirPort.  From the beginning, this young man gave us attitude. All the time he was dismissive and kept looking past us. After some puzzled back and forth and her insisting, he pointed to a laptop display and said to go find the email receipt. 

DD had trouble signing up to her email account and I had to help her. We searched through her email accounts and still no receipt. The employee stood a ways back. I saw him talking to another employee, looking our way, like we were thieves.

After a long time at the laptop looking for the receipt another employee (manager?) came to us. He looked at his hand-held device and in like TWO SECONDS found the transaction from the Philly store. He took the AirPort and refunded her credit card. Then he said "Will that be all?" DD and I just looked at each other and said "Uhm, yes?" and he turned and walked away.

By that point we were running late to be somewhere else and had to go. We were furious and for the rest of the trip I really wanted to go back to that little dork and his manager and give them a piece of my mind; but never got the chance. Las Vegas Fashion Show mall was my one sour Apple experience.I forgot to review this place on my recent trip to Vegas. 
While walking around the Del Mar Fair we got suckered into talking to some people from the WELK resorts. the gf had this look on her face like W.T.F is this for real? I told her it's easy, they drag you in they try and make a sale and all you gotta do is say NO for about an hour and BANG you get free crap!! =) 
First on the list, VEGAS baby!! 
SO on now to the review. Circus Circus... For the kids you are AWESOME. For a free room you cant really beat it. I guess i failed for not picking something closer to the center of the strip. We did end up paying a bit for cabs. 
The room, not bad. Nicer than some of the others i have stayed in but still. The view... you get a MIGHTY F+. I understand the room was free an all but really, guy at the front desk you had to make sure we got the room with a kick ass view of the back end of the building with a trash and cigarette filled alley? Shame on you!My boyfriend and I were in a rush to find a place to eat inside the Venetian before watching the Blue Man Group, and so we stumbled upon this cute little restaurant in the middle of the Venetian Shops. I ordered the Beef Risotto and my boyfriend ordered the Cannelloni Di Pollo. 

I expected a lot from my Beef Risotto since it was priced around $20 for a very small portion of food. The beef was probably the only highlight to the risotto. I did not like the wine sauce that it came with and the risotto tasted hard and not cooked thoroughly. I think I enjoyed eating my boyfriend's food more than my own. His order of the Cannelloni Di Pollo was overwhelmingly cheesy but the chicken and the marinara sauce was good. 

The service here is the main reason why I give this place only two stars. It was really really pain stakingly SLOW (I even emphasized to our waiter that we had a show to catch!). We were in such a rush to catch our show and almost missed it because of how slow the service was. We waited 15 minutes for someone to bring us our bill and towards the end we just walked up to pay for the meal.

I probably won't come back to this place since there are so many better restaurants in Vegas. But I guess if you have all the time in the world and want to pay for overpriced risotto you can give this place a shot.Slots-A-Fun has very strange odor. A mixture of cigarettes, hot dogs, pizza, B.O., and industial strength cleaner (the kind they use in the "adult" bookstores). I took a couple friends through here on the obligatory ten minute tour. Enough time to buy a couple beers, lose $3 in a slot machine (at least I got a quarter back!!! A real quarter-not a coupon-the only reason this place gets 2 stars!) and cruise by the $1 roulette table. I was hoping to teach my table game-wary friend how to play a simple game of roulette, but the proliferation of Lil' John and Ludacris wannabes hovering nearby scared her away. YEEEEAAAAH! Oh well- I never do well at those low limit tables anyway. I played craps here once and dealers were extemely rude. I wonder why this place, and circus circus,still exist when everything else nearby has been imploded.This hotel and casino for sure fits into the old school vegas.  It's still vintage like something out of a movie.  When I first entered I walked through the food court.  Yeah I said it...a freaking food court, it didn't even feel like i was in vegas, maybe some small town's mall.  The neon lights were mostly faded showing of signs of wear and tear.  

So why was i here? My friend was in a pool tournament, the BCAPL National 8 ball championship.  Their pool room is actually not half bad.  I know nothing about competitive pool but it was interesting to see all them playing head to head and only missing at the most 1-2 shots a match.  

It felt like EPSN on sunday afternoons without football.Bottom line... AVOID this place!
We got some good nachos, but we were starving so our judgment was impared. There was only 1 waitress for the entire place... at LUNCH TIME! She fought valiantly and did a great job, but she was outmatched by the many diners in attendance and the service was ultimately SLOW.  
Burgers are $10 each without sides. Not worth it, but the nachos were plenty big to share with 2 peeps (also $10). Come to think of it... every item on their menu is $10 with a few at $11 and $12.
They had Fat Tire on tap, which is great, but $6 for a pint is a Ripoff. Bloody Mary was $8. Again... ripoff.Disappointed. Been wanting to try this place for years, so when the groupon came up & thought it would be perfect to try it out. Upon entering, we were seated in an old room that may have been cool back in the 90's but not so much anymore. The first course was shrimp scampi, not bad but not impressive. Second course was the bowl of soup that tasted like progresso, then the hummus platter that was ok. Then the steak skewers that weren't bad but again not anything great. Lastly the chicken & cous cous. This isn't Moroccan food. 

The other strange thing was the belly dancer was Asian, aren't we at a Moroccan restaurant? Don't get me wrong, she was good. 

For 4 people to dine, with the $65 off for the groupon it still was $102. I'm sorry but it definitely was not worth it. Way better Mediterranean food at Paymons. Lastly the service was lacking, I sat for 20 minutes with an empty water glass, and the place was not busy. Save your $ go somewhere else.

Fake Moroccan restaurant. Owners are Lebanese.My advice, go to a nice restaurant on the Strip and you'll have a better and more fun experience, pay much less and get the same quality of food.

Let's start at the beginning....

My husband and I had both heard such great things about Michael's, so we thought we'd try out. From the moment we walked in it was awkwardly silent and not welcoming at all. People literally looked at us like we were crazy (and apparently we were for going there.)

After we waited at the bar for about 20 minutes, we were finally seated and then sat for another 15 minutes before anyone even came to say hi or take our order. Finally when the server arrived, he dropped off a platter of vegetables (yes, a giant platter) and two baskets of hard bread.

Once we received the menu (another 20 minutes later), the waiter didn't go over it with us or tell us what the experience would be like. So we just order our entrées and hoped for the best (by the way the prices were twice as much as the best steak houses on the Strip). The entrées came out about 20 minutes after we ordered and by that time we were completely full from the platter of veggies. The food was definitely great, but you can go to some of the best restaurants on the Strip (twice) for the price you pay at Michael's and get the same quality of food, if not better. 

After dinner, they asked us if we wanted dessert. Although we declined because we were so incredibly full and had to pack-up half of our entrées to go, they still insisted that we had to see the dessert cart. So we caved in and ordered a dessert. By this time, we were literally about to explode and then I kid you not, they brought an entire fruit basket (not fruit bowl or platter, a basket) AND a platter full of chocolate covered fruit. Don't you think the waiter would have mentioned that they bring out an entire fruit basket and chocolate cover fruit platter at the end of dinner when we said we did not want to order dessert because we were too full? Who can eat that much???

So in an effort to try to make our meal worth the price, we did our best to eat the fruit, but it was impossible. So concluding our dinner, we left uncomfortably full and with complete and utter buyer's remorse once we received our far too expensive bill. Meh.I have been here quite a few times but today was BS! (Below standards) normally they have phenomenal service but our waiter seemed distraught and it took a good 25 minutes just to place our order. The food was ok not as good as it used to be and the bread was as hard as a rock and when we asked for some fresh ones they refused saying that there only allowed 2 per person.Also every time we asked our waiter for something it took forever we would have to remind him multiple times before he actually brought it! All in all this place isn't worth the price.Two stars for the happy hour food/drink menu... But honestly the worst hookah in Las Vegas. If you don't believe me then go see for yourself. It never hit well, and even after having them change the coals, the bowl, and the base itself, the outcome was still crap (barely any smoke and minimal flavor). I hate to sound so harsh but honestly I've been here four times thinking each time that next time would be better, but I'm done trying. They need to make it so the coals aren't covered...I know there's a liability, but it really destroys the quality of the smoke and flavor when you have the cover on the coals...they're the only place I know of in Vegas that does that.

The decor is nice though :-)Food was ok. I had the chili relleno and it was not memorable. My friend had the chili relleno burger and he said it was great.   Service was pretty good.Just a bit mad at these guys. My derailer was quite noisy and needed adjustment. I saw that Mcghies had a derailer adjustment for $15 dollars. I've done their tune up for $70 and was happy with it. I decided to try Bike World because it was closer and also because it seems like it is a more mom-and-pop type shop. I like the service of smaller shops because people are very happy to have your business and generally it seems less stuffy. Well, anyways i decided that instead of a derailler adjustment I would pay extra and do a tune up. Bike World's price was $6.50 less than Mcghie's. I dropped it off at the location and was given a two day turnaround. I typically ride my road bike on Thursdays so I asked if it might be done a bit early. The gentleman asked me to check Wednesday. I did and they were close to finishing it. I was happy about that. I arrived, paid and picked it up. I notices that the bike was dirty. There was grease on the frame. Then, I looked at the cogs and the chain. They were greasy. I looked at the derailer. It was adjusted. I'm happy that the derailer was adjusted but a tune-up typically has the cassette degreased and cleaned, the chain degreased and cleaned, the brakes adluster and the frame wiped down. It looked like all they did was adjust the derailers and brakes. I am mechanically inclined and could have done the adjustments and the tune up myself but I chose to pay so a professional could do the tune up. Not, being happy with it I asked what exactly a tune-up entailed. There window says its a 15 point tune-up. The gentleman seemed embarrassed and offered to clean it up, so maybe he just took a short cut on my bike and maybe it's usually not like this. I personally am not willing to find out. I am going to continue going to McGhie's or ask my riding group for a good bike shop.I used to frequent this place all the time, it was a favorite for my wife and I. Sadly Dave and Jolene sold the place about a year ago and it was not the same upon our return a while back.
The first let down was the entire place had been somewhat remodeled. Granted it was always clean before, but it had a certain old school  dive type charm  to it. The mess of pictures and memorabilia all over the walls, etc. It wasn't classy but it was perfect in its own way. However the new owners painted it a bright white and the usual dim lighting which complimented the place was changed to bright lights. 

It took forever to get anyone to help us, at least 15 minutes, then longer than forever to get our food. We waited at least 25 minutes where as Dave used to have your sandwich in front of you in 5. The sandwich had hardly any meat on it and it as well as the French fries were doused in salt. We asked for extra cheese however couldn't even spot minimal cheese on there.
The cooks were three kids around 18. Not sure how you can sell an "authentic Philly steak" when it is made by a kid fresh out of high school. I used to have a friend who spent the better part of his life in Philly and told me more about cheesesteaks then I could ever imagine.

The guy who claimed he was the owner tried to make it right by not charging us but still nothing was the same. I wish the best to the new owners but it is no longer what I am looking for. Change is not always a good thing.You get what you pay for.  It was barely $30 a night and right on Fremont Street.  I don't care what they try to tell you- all the so called cartoony disney-like glitz and glam on the strip tries to hide what Las Vegas really is... FREMONT STREET.  This is where all the neon lights are and the cheese-iness of what Las Vegas is known for. 

I imagine the hotel may have been lovely back in its day.  You can see the little touches where back in its time it may have been classy.  Now, the decor is out of date in the rooms very 80s, with paint peeling on the walls, holes and stains on the chairs, but non-the-less roomy for it's price.  If you read the mandatory pricing posted this room was originally $250 back in its day... true or not don't pay any more than $30 bucks for this place. When you pay $30 for a place, don't be silly or expecting a four star hotel or even Motel 6.

Oh and what was scary was that the boxspring had a clear plastic cover shrink wrapped to encase it- clear sign that there was a bed bug issue but hey looks like they took care of it, right?Cherry lime aid? Yes, diet of course, 460 calories and 120g of sugar on a rt 44 is a no no with me!

Sooo Sonics are usually all the same, same menu, pricing, and annoying order speaker. The first time we came here the experience was pretty ok, this last time it was sheet! Pure sheet!

So after 8pm shakes are half off, this time I opted for a cherry pineapple in medium (2.99 for med) and a jr deluxe burger no onion or tomato. 

So I press the button and the lady comes on. I give her our order and mind you I speak verrryyy clearly and slow so she can understand. She repeats the order "you want 2 double cheeseburgers no onions?" AHHH! NOOOO!! 1 jr deluxe burger no onion no tomato. She spits the order out again and it seems to be correct and gives us the total which is like 5$ over. So I sit there in awe and push the button to ask how this came about. Ohh I forgot to give you the discount for the meal. So the total is now 2$less. I ask her to repeat my order and again she includes the double cheeseburgers! I politely tell her no, and repeat what I wanted.

At this point in time Im like wtf? I cant find a job but they hire this yodle to work here?! So out comes our car hop. She repeats our order and what comes out of her mouth? 1 jr deluxe burger... the 1 thing I CANNOT STAND IS TOMATO. It legit makes me puke!! So I look at my burger and low and behold TOMATO AND ONIONS! Im about to go ape shit as we are leaving, like seriously? I have spoke slowly and clearly and told you my order 3 times and you STILL cannot get it right? WTF!? Plus my shake tasted like garbage AND she didnt give me a full discount on it!

Now I wouldnt be a little jerk, but if I tell you an order like 100 times, it should be correct! I didnt call and complain I just ended up tossing the onions and tomato and wiping the tomato remnants off my burger.

Will I come here again? Probably, I do love their diet cherry lime aids! Their workers are just somewhat of ding bats!The accommodations were an improvement from our previous stays.  The location is another plus: somewhat close to friends south of the Strip and in Henderson.  The parking garage is a big plus.

The RESORT FEE ticks me off.  You never hear of it until too late.  I've stayed at Sam's Town and paid the resort fee there, but didn't think to check before checking in here.  Gotta do a better job of checking on ALL hotels with that fee and ALL hotels without that fee.

I will not stay here again.One thing Phoenix has in abundance is good Mexican food.  I mean REALLY good. So it's beyond me why anyone would settle for mediocre. Which this was.

It was bland.  It was greasy.  The shrimp dish we ordered had no spice or flavor at all.  My chips were fresh, which judging by the rest of the reviews here was a lucky thing. A side of soft corn tortillas came pre-slathered in grease, for some ridiculous reason. And for what it was, it was terribly overpriced.  That's not to say it was expensive at all, but Filibertos is consistently better than this was.  Somehow the two green corn tamales I got to go were $10?  Give me a break.

Yes, my butt shared the same space as Bush Junior's did (according to the plaque at our table), but that didn't enhance the experience.The name is suitable. Overall, EHHHHHH is my opinion on EHHHHthel M. Chocolates. 

I learned about this place after seeing a special of it on Food Network. It wasn't too far from the STRIP, but the place wasn't as amazing as it appeared on TV. They have a self-guided tour. When I went, there weren't any workers and nothing was in operation. All you would see were lonely turned-off machienery behind a glass and some brief history info on a few panels. I got ONE sample at the end. ONE.

After, I bought some chocolate. Not because I thought it was so good, but because I felt like I had to.. i felt like I had to satisfy my unfulfilled chocolate factory experience..

As I ate that chocolate, I lied to myself about how good it was to make me feel better..

Okay, it's not bad at all. The chocolate itself deserves four stars and for the price it's okaaay, but I'd rather buy chocolate elsewhere.

Their miniscule cactus garden isn't anything special. You could stare at it, to make you feel better somehow too I guess..I'm glad we got half price tickets.

This show is fairly entertaining, the tricks are pretty basic (except, of course for their famous finale, I'm sure you've seen, involving bullets), my problem is with their approach.

They basically "call out" anything metaphysical, which is fine, I'm a non-believer too, but the show is basically like this:
"You know (name any fairly famous psychic here)?  Yeah he's/she's bullshit.  Everything he says is smoke and mirrors.  Here I'll prove it.  *Does something small involving a hidden camera* SEE!?
Our tricks are fake too.
But ours are better right?!"

It seems to me if you're going to "out" magic or psychics, tell us how you did yours, not just in one shitty example.  Essentially they're asking us not to trust what anyone says....because Penn & Teller are telling us so.

There's a little irony there.

There's a funny bit which I really liked, involving a "perspective from a camera."

Other than that, pretty entertaining but blah.i'm going to be a straight up bitch on this one.  I used to live in NY, hell i miss it sometimes, so when i had the chance to stay at NY NY this week for a business trip, i did in the hopes that i would be happy in one of my favorite places in the world, LAS VEGAS.

But wait...2 stars...porque?

THEY ARE DOING ALL KINDS OF FUCKING CONSTRUCTION!  WTF?  Tell me that shit before I book it.  Cheap assoles.  Their new glitzy club ROK isn't even open yet.  I could barely eat.  I had a shitty piece of pizza that wasn't close to a NY Slice.  And worst of all...they are doing most of the construction in the middle of the fucking casino!  NO SIC-BO.  I come to NYNY for the Sic-Bo, that shit is bonkers and still manageable when you are trashed.  Chinese Craps = Sic-Bo.  Look it up, its amazing and RARE in casino's due to it's "easy to play, easy to win" gameplay.  There used to be a lounge, but now that shit is gone.

oh and hell, the "Times Square Bar & Grill" shithouse was a total bummer.  The mofo on the piano was definitely tone deaf and was murdering everything from Bon Jovi to Billy Joel.  I SUCK at singing and I could do better than that.

I'm not done, i "splurged" for a massage and i got a bad back rub...i hinted "you can do it a little harder" and nothing.  It wasn't cheap either.  The lady was just not happy with her job and talked to me about how the economy is bad in Vegas right now and she is barely squeaking by....
awkward, sob stories during massages equals NO RELAXATION.  The only good thing about the Spa experience was their eucalyptus sauna room but that got old quick because...it's a fucking sauna...180 degrees and you are suppossed to sit in there and chill.  I lasted 3 minutes max, then i wanted to stop sweating.

The room was "meh" for sure...VERY NY (aka tiny as shit).  

Whatever, i'm a hater, i expect more from MGM-Mirage, i thought NYNY was one of the "nicer" places on the strip.  OH and i hate kids at Casinos...total bummer.  I just realized that, when i'm enjoying a vice (CRAPS) the last thing i need is some little squirt in a bathing suit yelling at his mother.  If i crap out when that happens i think he deserves a smack.  Respect the game little one.

I will take this review down if by the time i return the construction is done.  If not then I will probably update it with more hatred.

Until then, i hear Mandalay Bay is nice?Second time staying at this hotel in the past few years. A better experience the first stayin 2009. We stayed for 3 nights this past week in the Broadway Deluxe Room. Check in on a Thurs afternoon was painfully slow, the temp in the room was not cold enough, bad cell recept in the room, and very slow wi fi. Now for the yucky parts...the pool appeared to have vomit or something of the same consistency in one section of the pool and as we dove into bed the first night, there were crumbs as if someone had just eaten a sandwich. Blehhhh!! We requested housekeeping to exchange out all of the bedding, both beds which they did so.
We did not go back in the pool the rest of our stay. Duh. 
A few things we DID enjoy: the arcade had a great variety of games. The restaurants throughout the hotel was fabulous and we love walking through the shops and deli/cafes admiring the decor of old New York. Slot games - good variety too.I've been coming to the Las Vegas Hilton for years for conventions. It's definitely not a stylish Strip hotel, but in the past the rooms have been clean and spacious. Not this time. I checked into my room only to find that it had not been cleaned. There was hair in the bathroom. Garbage was still in the trash cans. There were crumbs on the table and the bed had been laid on. In addition, all the drawers were open to the dresser. When I called down to the front desk they didn't believe me at first saying "my computer indicates that the room has been cleaned." I told the front desk that they could come check it for themselves. They did bring us a key to a new room, but it was in a far wing and not a real upgrade or anything for the inconvenience. My other gripe is that half the restaurants (Noodle bar, sushi place and the Mexican place) were closed during the convention. Seems like a huge missed opportunity for businesss. I also asked about a show they have and the front desk was clueless as to what we were talking about even though it's advertised throughout the hotel. Now that the convention will be moved to a different hotel, next year I will not be coming back to the Hilton. This places desperately needs a makeover. It's a tomb. There's nothing going on here ever.Sorry to say this place is taking a nose dive. The quality of rooms are subpar, the gaming is limited, and their buffet was awful. Sadly, LVH is starting to match the Riveria in quality.

Don't get me started about the moody staff . . .The casino area was the worst of all I encountered.  It actually smelled so bad I had to wait outside for an hour for my friends to finishing wandering around.  I dodged back in twice to check the score of the Cubs game, but basically held my breath at the gaming area the entire time.  It was pretty gross.

Perusing reviews, it appears that some of the toiletries smelled nice, so I imagine if you walked around the casino with some of those shoved up to your nose, you wouldn't even notice.

Outside though, I got to watch the water show at the Bellagio twice, so I was glad I could enjoy it.Old hotel, everything outdated, nothing impressive. It was actually not that memorable. The hotel is set back a little from the street, so you feel like you're never reaching the hotel door. The casino was old and our dealer was a jerk. He assumed no one knew how to play roulette & spoke as if we were children and reminded us when to make bets. Never visiting this hotel/casino again.Eh...... Ummmmm
Eh...... Kind of impressed when I got there.... But then..... The flash wore off..

True= from what I got from other reviews and now validated by me...
 Total vanilla musky strong smell fills the air! So strong it does cover the smoke smell but almost burns your nose hairs in the process!

True= long ass walk to the  pool, you have to walk through casino, lobby and then the food court to get to the pool? WIERD if you ask me, and I stayed in the main building.... Yes the big green one. Also. THE POOL and LAZY RIVER had a lot of trash around it, beer bottles, bottle caps, napkins; a kind of gross insert waterfalls :/

True= automatic blinds in hotel room and lots of drunk douchebags... But that's what Vegas is now, sorry Old Vegas. 

The MGM is one of the nicer hotels in Las Vegas..... And customer service a little like my cell service, spotty.  
But... There were just a lot of weird quirks at the MGM that made this stay undesirable. Ehhhh Vegas baby, nahhhh no thanks I'll pass.It's very well known... you get what you pay for. We definitely go we paid for at IP Hotel & Casino. The casino is small and pretty lame in my honest opinion. If I wasn't staying there, I wouldn't have gambled there! The only thing it really has going for itself is that it's centrally-located on the strip and a good place to go either north or south. Otherwise, I'm not staying here again.

The room was A/C'ed and comfortable. My biggest gripe is that the bathrooms have NO locks. WTH!? It's not like I was staying with my dad who wouldn't open the door on me; that's a scary thought. I was staying with friends... the ones that think it's funny to barge in! Yes, I wasn't a happy camper, but I managed to shower at odd hours to avoid any weirdness. The pool is rectangular. IP is an older hotel & casino so I guess I shouldn't expect much. But its a standard pool with a standard hot tub. Spent two mornings here with daquiri's in hand.... boy I didn't feel good once 10:30am rolled around. No more alcohol for breakfast!

Good place for people with a budget that want to hit up Vegas. Although, if you're going to Vegas... you shouldn't be budgeting! Just don't expect a super nice hotel for the price you pay.Went with a large group. The food was cold and the bernaise sauce was icy. The other waiter never came back so we couldn't switch out. Ended up just eating it.Hmmmm...I've tried the Fireside Lounge twice now.  I just...don't...get it.  

Why is this place so popular?  

Is it the decor of very faded and cigarette burned booths?  The plastic, fake trees?  The smoke-so-thick-you-can-slice-it air?  The aggravating eye-soar pink lights?

It definitely isn't the drinks.  My friend's Jack and Coke was pretty much just Coke.  My chocolate chip cookie martini wasn't anything special or something that I couldn't find at TGIFridays.

I just don't get the hype about this place.  Sorry.On a last minute trip to Vegas, we were only able to get a deal at Luxor. Once we checked into the room I was very underwhelmed. I couldn't believe Priceline ranked this hotel 4 stars!

Negatives: 
I expected the old decor, but the beds had motel type comforters with the fuzzy blanket underneath and only 2 flat pillows per bed. You can also feel the springs in the mattresses. 

The hotel also charges a $15 resort fee which gets you 2 bottles of water/day, internet (cable plug), and newspaper (for pick up).

Positive:
The pools are nice and good sized.

This hotel will suffice if you just want to be on the strip and don't care about where you sleep.I Had been at Bouchon a few Times But last one (May 17) Made me think that this place does not worth it the prices for brunch are Ridiculous, 2 eggs benedict $27 I didnt like the experience because there are a lot fabulous places in Vegas that Bouchon for me Bouchon is famous but not Amazing anymoreI have to admit that I was disappointed in the food Olives. Service was great and they were very understanding when we were an hour late for our reservation (we called twice). 

I really liked the bread they serve in the beginning with the olive tapenade. The warm walnut bread with honey was AMAZING and we even requested more.

Started the meal with the beet salad and crab beignets and it was just meh. Really didn't have any flavor and wasn't impressed. The crab beignets also were like deep fried crab cakes and not beignets. It didn't do much for me in terms of flavor or taste.

The main dishes were the portabello mushrooms flatbread and the salmon trio. The flatbread was probably the best thing we ate (except the warm walnut bread rolls...drool...) and you could taste the truffle oil on it too. If you're going to eat there, I'd highly recommend that you order a flat bread.

The salmon trio was a seared salmon, salmon cake, and salmon tabouli. The seared salmon wasn't anything special but i did appreciate they didn't overcook it. I thought the salmon cake was interesting and probably my favorite of the three. The tabouli wasn't memorable. Not worth $36.

Ended the meal with a vanilla souffle and taste-wise it was fine but the consistency was off. My expectations of a souffle at a Mediterranean restaurant were also not high.

Overall it was a pleasant atmosphere and our waitress was great. I just didn't think the food was really worth the prices and I would not go back again if I was in Vegas.Been there 4 times, gotten worse every time.  Definitely don't go on a Sunday, they were out of several menu items but we didn't find out until about 15 minutes after we originally ordered. Service was meh, still up in the air about whether or not we will ever go backovercrowded. overrated.Alright, so I paid a good $40 dollars (including tip) of my hard earned money to eat here cause I've heard so much about it. My parents told me I needed to go because the food and selections are just incredible. After the longest half-hour of my life waiting in line, and apparently that's a shorter wait. It was after 7pm so thankfully most the tourists already ate.

The selections are alright, I've seen better. The taste wasn't that great. I was extremely disappointed with that! I've been to a better buffet down in Vegas, and that's at Rio.

Although, I'll give it to my waiter, and cooks behind the food - they were very, very friendly.
Oh, but here's a negative. I'm not even sure if it's the only bathroom in there, it would be ridiculous if there was. But I believe I remember only 3 STALLS IN THE BATHROOM!? You're kidding rght????

No, I would never come here again. People create such a hype for no reason at all.Wish I'd spent the extra and gone to Caesars instead. Was either tasteless or too salty and just seemed cheap?!
The service was horrendous too. Didn't get a smile from a member of staff once, certainly didn't deserve a tip.
Only good thing was the crab.  I wouldn't bother - spend the extra and get something memorableCame here for breakfast on the final leg of our Buffet of Buffets marathon. 

Wow. If I had paid for this place, I would have been pissed. Service was excellent. I adored our server. She asked if we wanted a to-go cup of coffee. No one has ever offered that!

The juice was clearly from concentrate. The Mexican and Salad sections were closed. What? No Mexican breakfast? Those are the best dishes! 

Middle Eastern included bagels and lox. This was probably my favorite section. I forced fed myself lox with capers to get my money's worth. I liked the mozzarella and tomato salad, but it was something I could find at a supermarket deli. 

Dessert section looked like it was filled with mini packaged pastries. I selected a chocolate croissant, but it was flaky and dry, so I skipped it. 

On to the American section. There were 2 types of benedicts. They looked good, but I think they became overcooked from the heat lamp. The country style potatoes were good and surprisingly still crispy. I did however, find these potatoes repeated 2 more times. It also seemed like these were the seasoned potatoes you find in the freezer aisle. 

There was an omelet station, that I skipped. And I think a crepe station in the Dessert section. 

Stopped in the Asian section to get a squirt of sriracha. 

I stopped off for a cheese blintz, but never ate it. It was pretty burnt and didn't have much filling. The section also included French toast and pancakes?

There was a nice oatmeal/cream of wheat section. Then, a fresh fruit section where you could construct your own parfait. 2 yogurt flavors, shredded coconut and granola? 2 smoothie options. They were really plain. I think one was banana, the other, strawberry. 

The final section included spinach and cheese egg scramble, but I didn't see any cheese or spinach. There were potato pancakes. And a turkey hash which had fingerling potatoes (yum) and roasted peppers. I took the time to dig out the pepper and fingerlings. This was one of the only things that didn't seem pre-made. And it was pretty good.  

I looked through the photos for lunch and dinner and they all look like a completely different restaurant! I don't know, guess they dropped the ball for breakfast. Kind of a shame for people like me who love breakfast.For years, Tao was consistently fun but, as the Venetian has chased down market over the last 6 months, the club has followed. I was just there on Friday night and was genuinely sad to see what Tao had become. While other reviewers complain that Tao isn't "welcoming," the benefit of that policy was that the guy:girl ratio was relatively close to 1:1 and the crowd was well dressed and attractive. Now, while the drinks are just as pricey, it's become a sausage fest of sweaty, thug-like guys.

The music selection seems to have followed the crowd. The DJ on Friday night was the worst I've heard at Tao in the 5 years I've been going there. Lots of 80s rock ballads. I'm all for Pat Benatar, but "Love is a Battle Field" is odd to hear at Tao, especially multiple times over a 2-hour period. It was on heavy rotation in both rooms on Friday. No song stayed on the turntable for more than about 30 seconds, and even then they were continuously interrupted with: "Everyone in the house from the LA, make some noise! Everyone from the midwest, make some noise!" Yeah. Maybe that's someone's scene. Not really mine.

If you liked clubs like "Rain" or the old "Ra" (before it became "LAX") then Tao will totally now be your cup of tea. If, in the past, you had a hard time getting into Tao, now is time to try again because the controls have loosened. Tao is still an amazing space, but the town has changed in the last 6 months and Tao has changed with it. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem like Vegas has the volume these days to support several hot clubs anymore. Tao, PURE, Jet, Bank are all losing their crowds to XS which is about the only place in town with the previous Vegas energy anymore.

The good news is the restaurant remains good. Surprisingly, it's always been one of the best values for a solid dinner in town and it continues to achieve this. The management treats large groups well (reasonable prices, lots of flexibility, comping everyone in to the club after dinner) so if you're traveling with a bunch of people who want to grab dinner and then go out then there's still no where better. The lounge these days, which is free to enter, seems these days to have a better crowd than the club itself (and definitely had a better DJ on Friday night). Finally, Tao Beach can be a lot of fun. It's not open yet this season, but if it can establish itself this year as the best pool party then maybe some of the energy will spill over to the club as the night goes on. That said, I don't know how it's going to compete with XS which has more floor space, more tables, a better pool and a more integrated dance floor.

I root for Tao to regain its former stature but... until the economy picks up in Vegas again, I fear it's going to be a pretty sad scene.Kind of a "meh" for The Hotel these days, they don't seem to be keeping their game up.  The rooms are, as most agree, nicely appointed small suites.  However, THE housekeeping is subpar, we checked in and found a set of car keys and tin of altoids mints on the floor by the bed.  Also, THE furniture sucks.  THE coffee table in the living room had clearly had the leg broken off and was crudely repaired with wood glue oozing out of the cracks.  When I mentioned this to THE front desk representative at checkout, his response was a rhetorical "Really?" indicative of nothing.

All told, I kind of expected more for almost 300 bucks/night + $25 resort fee.  

On the pro side, still love the beach, wave pool, and lazy river here. Note: you now must purchase your inner tubes for the lazy river for $22 which doesn't seem that bad compared to what everything else costs in Vegas, lol.

I suppose the lesson is, don't bother paying more for the dirty suites with broken furniture in THE hotel, as you can use the beach facilities by staying at the cheaper Mandalay Bay.If it weren't in the Palms, it might be better.  As it stands, it's quite a trek for a bar with a view of Vegas.

But hey, if you feel like waiting in a 2-hour line before you drink, the Ghost Bar is a good place to start.It doesn't take that much to keep me entertained. but for some reason, this show was unbearably boring -_-' I mean, the first half hour was pretty good and overall the show had pretty nice effects. But there was a point when I seriously wanted to fall asleep and wait for it to be over. The story plot, in my opinion, was really hard to understand. And for the parts I actually understood, they were really boring.There's good and there's bad. But the bad wins over the good on this one :xI only came here because my coworkers and I were starving after work and this was the closest joint we all could agree on.  Ordered the french onion soup and penna mushroom pasta.  

The soup was what I needed after a long day of work.  It had to much onions though and not enough broth.  The cheese on top was was crispy and crunchy,. gooey,. mmm,. def will recommend this to cure a fat hangover.

The pasta was really bland, chicken to dry, but the presentation was SUPERb!,.  

Don't think I will come back,. expensive for mediocre food. My meal itself was $30The meat quality is low - perhaps suitable for canning but not for serving at a restaurant. I do not eat here for this reason.A New Vegas night club in the middle of New Vegas. Unfortunately, this place represents all the crap of new vegas you could probably do without. The douchbaggery of the men, the general stuck-up hoe-ness of the women. $14 "double" rum and cokes which tastes like niether rum nor coke. The only redeeming quality is that damn artificial waterfall and the outdoor seating. Even the DJ sucked.

Only slightly redeemable because of the waterfall and a nice, empty Tuesday or Wednesday.First time I waited in line and payed to get in at a club. $20 a person on a Thursday night..... ehhh?? But even though there was a huge line... we didn't have to wait that long.

You take the Elevator (which by the way smelled and it must have been 110 degrees inside it) to the 51st floor. The place is huge!! You come up to a large sitting area with a small dance floor and a DJ playing House music. Wasn't our thing so we went straight for the outside area.

The outside was phenomenal. Two LARGE dance floors, a bar, and a gorgeous view (check out the pictures)! No place to sit unless you reserved a spot with bottle service. The music was ok and the dance floor was packed... till they had some breakdancing contest and started playing some weird shit. 90% of people left the dance floor and the friends I was with didn't feel like dancing to that music. I mean... I didn't pay $20 to wait in line and watch someone else dance (yes... I was dancing... leave me alone).

The drinks were kinda weak. Someone got me my first drink, it was $12 and weak as hell. After that one I knew I had to ask for something stronger (if I wanted to keep dancing, that is....) so I got a double vodka and cranberry ($24) which was much better but way too expensive.

I'd recommend checking this place out at least once for the view. That's all.....With only Wagyu beef on the menu one would think this place knows what they're doing and how to prepare this unique breed of cow. wrong WRONG

Wagyu cows are the same as Kobe cows, they just don't or no longer come from Kobe Japan, (think Hennessy and cognac)

Wagyu is special because the cows are bred to have LOTS of marbled fat in the meat and suppose to be very tender and make you never want to eat another cow ever again.

Voodoo lounge does an excellent job of making this delicate meat taste like an expensive version of what i can get at a run down casino's buffet. My cut was over salted and tough which i was not expecting from wagyu beef

The entree isnt really an entree, you have to order your sides separate.

To those who cant tell the difference between Waygu and standard american beef this place is probably  4 to 5 stars. I can tell the difference and i am greatly disappointed.My parents were visiting and I decided to take them to Fez.  The food was good but the service was terrible.  It took them 15 minutes to even notice that we arrived and were waiting to be seated even though there were tons of staff about.  The waitress rarely checked on us, never refilled the water carafe, and then proceeded to misplace my dad's debit card.  Most of the staff ignored us since we weren't their table and those we did interact with weren't very friendly.  My parents said that this experience would keep them from eating here again and I have to say I feel the same way.  It is unfortunate since the food was spot on.uhhh...am i missing something? i've heard so much about the wynn buffet and how amazing it is but i was completely unimpressed!! 

my friends and i paid $43.00 each for dinner and it was SO NOT WORTH IT!!!!!!!!!!!!
they have a wide selection of food to choose from but there wasn't anything really appealing...the food was either too salty, too bland or plain GROSS. the only thing i enjoyed was the brisket. 

never. coming. here. again. -_______-This buffet has seen better days. No longer does the Friday/Saturday dinner buffet feature Alaskan King Crab legs. Instead, they serve the cheaper and less flavorful snow crab. 

Most other food stations were decent. However, the sushi area was really sad, and the Prime Rib was nowhere near as good as I remembered. Nothing I tried really stood out in taste; so I never went back for seconds of anything. Overall, just a very expensive and underwhelming experience.

As for the positive, the wait was short and the buffet is still very clean. 

I recommend the Bacchanal Buffet at Ceasar's Palace. This buffet is the new undisputed king in town. The Ingredients are of high quality and everything tastes really good. Bacchanal, just like the Wynn Buffet, is also very clean. 

The line at Bacchanal may be long but stick it out. It will be well worth the wait. Another option would be Wicked Spoon at the Cosmo, however I've only been there for brunch not dinner.We have the sliders at the Fix every time we are in Vegas. Really enjoy the simplicity of it and usually very consistent. That being said, this place is way overpriced for the value and the wait staff leave a lot to be desired. We have actually had the same waiter twice now and both times he has been less than stellar. Considering the atmosphere and location this is not much of a problem, but with the plates as expensive as they are??? Menu also could stand more updating and larger selection.Chinese food is supposed to be somewhat economical.  I know that this is the Wynn and I am supposed to be getting mad comps to offset the overpriced food, but this is a little ridiculous.

$9 for hot and sour soup?  Granted it was made well and such, but dang, it was a portion for one!

$26 for 8 oz of duck and 6 oz of BBQ pork?

$18 for beef chow mein?  It was enough for two... maybe.

$9 for plain congee for one?

Here's the ugly truth.  I was comped $80 for 10 hours of blackjack (which is a mildly crappy food comp, by the way).  Somebody's got to pay for that.  It's the same reason why the Buffet is $33 for Sunday brunch (no champagne).  None of this explains why the Wynn Buffet is so terrible though, but I'm getting off topic here.

Anyway, if you are a big fish (or maybe a mini-whale), I'm sure you won't care, but for us mortals, it sort of matters that this really is a pretty bad deal.  And Wynn's comps sort of suck... grrr... sorry, off topic again.This place has an awesome steak and ahi tuna! But sad to say THEY GAVE MY PARTY  a HORRIBLE service! my experince with prime was 7 years ago and i couldnt shake off the horrible memory.. We were celebrating for my friend who was leaving for the navy, i give the ambiance a 4 star and the food a 4 star. everything was pricey but worth every bite. The thing i did not like most was the service! Just because our party was young and we did not order bottle service the waiter decided to ignore us! After we left the restaurant we approaced the person in charge and told them how horrible the service was. all he said was " what can i do to make it right" , like all he cared about was giving us comps thinking we were these snooty little rich kids who just wanted to complain. All we said was NOTHING we just wanted to inform you, because our intentions was not to get anything for free we just wanted to inform the person in charge of the horrible waiter... Would I dine again at PRIME? perhaps i really did enjoy their food and Prime Patio is to die for giving you an awesome view of the fountains as you sip on your coffee..mehhh I've had better for less.... I'm talking about the food and service(lack of) Go to Mcdonalds or dennys instead. It's just convenient but then you wait 45 minutes for chicken tenders that are mediocre at bestWhat happened to this show makes me sad.  This show USED to be my favorite.  It used to be so full of heart, soul, beauty, depth and honesty.  It used to have a really wonderful spooky feel and emotional arc.

Not technically a Cirque du Soleil show, it was developed by the capable hands of Benoit Jutras, who had done work with Cirque in the past.  He made it really wonderful.

Then, two things happened: Wynn started to pander too much to focus groups, and spent multi-millions of dollars on lighting for the show.  Focus groups can be damaging: just because you don't like something doesn't mean it should be removed from a show (for example, we don't like villains, but we need them for a good show).  Basically, uneducated opinions (sounds pretentious, I know, but those without art structural backgrounds) ruined the show.  The lighting turned the show into the Bellagio fountains with some acrobats flitting all over it. 

Why do people believe we are so stupid that we only want movement and color?  That we don't need a plot, honesty, or heart?  Not even kids are that rudimentary.  It's insulting.

Now, Le Reve is basically a wet Lite-Brite that has no teeth, heart or soul.  I'm really glad I got to see it before it was internally destroyed, but I am sad I can't share one of my favorite experiences with anyone else.

:(We went to this place cause we looked at some reviews and people gave high remarks BUT we were disappointed. The enterance showed promise, but the inside let us down. We sat at a table inside that over looked the pond with the ducks and turtles but there were 5 flys on our window alone. And we sat right next to a fly light. I ordered the quesadilla and added chicken and it was soaking wet with juice from the chicken. The tortilla fell apart because of it be so soaked. We had ordered the app quac but it came with the meal and tasted more like avacado paste than quac. Had high hopes but was let down.If this were a $5.99 buffet, it would get 3 stars.
Tries to do too much and all of it poorly.  Ok, maybe the cotton candy was alright.
Awful awful sushi.  I didn't even try the stir fry it looked so bad. Bland BBQ.  Salad bar scary, small and boring, and dressings not labeled/arranged.  Taco bar but no taco shells or tortillas.  I HATE snow crab legs that have been shredded in half, so much harder to extract the meat (if you think its a benefit then you don't know how to eat snow crab).  Burnt cream looked to have have the torch waved over it for a second leaving a film of sugar-water on top.
Ice cream and Carving station ok, swift attentive waiters.
I remember the days, not long ago, when $5.99 (or less) on the strip would get you about the same quality.  Then Mirage came in with 'gourmet' buffet and marked the beginning of massive price increases with the rationale that they were laying out high quality stuff.  Now it seems they can just lay out so-so stuff and still get away with charging premium prices.I stayed here on a family road trip to visit some relatives in Las Vegas. A convenient location off the Strip, this place is very much appreciated from being adjacent to the Las Vegas Convention Center.
My family and I had a late check in. The overnight agent was cordial and patient with checking myself in. He asked my preferences and did his best to accommodate. My family had forgotton some bags in the rental car and we asked the front desk agent to radio the Valet for the rest of our bags so we may change faster before an appointment in the morning. He radioed in front of us and the Valter/Bellman on the other side said, "you're kidding me! I just brought all the bags up and parked the car!" The front desk agent looked embarrassed so he stepped away to talk to the Valet/Bellman. Momentarily, the Valet/Bellman appeared and repeated to the Front Desk agent, not even acknowledging us, that he couldn't believe we needed the rest of our bags. My sister stated, "yes please." He looked at us both frowning and upset and saying, "I asked you if you had all the bags and you said yes," confronting my little sister. She stated it was very early in the morning and she forgot two in the front seat. He gave a loud sigh and went back out. Please note, the parking garage is only steps away. 
We described to him the two bags up front to have delivered to the room. When he came up to the room, he had brought the wrong bags, but being in a bad mood and apparantly showing us, we decided to get the rest of the bags in the morning...
The layout is easy enough. Very easy to get around... Inside there is a Cafe behind the Front Desk that serves Illy Coffee, major plus because that is my favorite coffee brand. But the cashier/barista was short staff. There was a line of 5 and she was by herself... hopefully, I'd like to assume they are not staffed like that all the time and I just happened to be there on another ones break. But no relief? 
The room was okay. A typical room, but I'd expect more from a Renaissance brand. Also, the therapeutic bed did not fit the bed board. So when my sisters and I would talk on each others bed, we could feel the mattress slide underneath us, to fit the bed board. The walls are thin. We could hear the next room coughing...
The morning Valet were all cheerful! Tangerines during check in were a nice touch. The furniture may be too tacky modern for my taste. The television screens are good, but when my mother in the second room tried to hook up the internet connection from her laptop to her television in the room, it would not read. The pool area looked a little tired.  A little disappointing....
When my family came back from the last night out they found a COCKROACH ON THE FLOOR IN THE HALL OF THE LOBBY! Now, I used to live in Vegas for a few, during the boom of the real estate... & I remember the houses of my and my neighbors' have to get rid of the desert bugs. But a cockroach in a hotel is a nightmare!!!!
When they told me this in the morning, we talked to the Manager on Duty. She deeply apologized. I had to correct the folio, my mother had talked to someone that night to take off the bill because it wasn't working and this was not done. 
I'd only come back here unfortunately, just for the coffee :( It was not my forte :(The wait was a little longer then it needed to be since there were tons of opened tables.  The hostess asked the waitress on the way to our table if it was ok to sit us there and she was very bothered by it.  After that the service was TERRIABLE!  The food was alright, we had lunch the triple decker club and the ruben.  The potato salad was delicous!  prices were very reasonable in my opinion especially compared to the other casinos it came to 30 for both lunches and drinks.  The best part of this place is sitting on the "patio" where youa re in the casino so you feel like you're outdoors, especially if you enjoy the Paris.

I know most people don't really take kids to Vegas, but we were just on a quick day trip so we did have my son and there is no kids meal just as an FYI they do however have high-chairs.

Over all the place isn't a total loss but I think we'll try someplace else our next trip.I'm from San Francisco, so I'm used to amazing noodles and Chinese food in general. The smells coming from the restaurant were great. Sadly when I got my dish, a shanghai style noodle soup, it wasn't great. Very little flavor and the meat wasn't cooked to my liking. Worth a try if you're willing to risk it.A bit whack.... Dancers were very stiff ( no pun intended) nice bodies but that's about it.... I've been to Hollywood men in l.a and that was cool...sexy men and actually looked like they were into women.... These not so much!And you could do some heavy petting... Not here unless you stood in a long ass line and why would you want to... They were not that attractive.  I would not go back.I can tolerate bad food when there's great service, and I'll deal with awful service when there's amazing food.  But at Il Mulino, we paid $100/person for above-average food and below-average service.  You can do better in LV.

FOOD: Il Mulino starts you off with some tasty complimentary appetizers.  The parmesan cheese was great.  The bruschetta was decent, but I've had better.  The mussels were not fresh, but they're free.

None of the main courses wowed me, and at the price, they definitely should have.  The osso bucco ($48) was tender but bland, and came with a saffron risotto that was dry and gloppy, not creamy and luxurious the way it should be.  The lobster ravioli ($40ish) was overly cheesy and tasted nothing like lobster.  The veal chop (not sure) was totally dry and tasteless, like an overcooked pork chop.  The capellini with truffles and pancetta ($30) was the best main course, but I couldn't taste any truffle at all, so there was nothing too special about it.

SERVICE: Started great, ended pretty badly.  From the minute you sit down, servers swarm you and start throwing free food at you.  Awesome.  But our actual waiter was snide and inattentive.  When my mother asked him to repeat some of the specials, he scoffed, "Really? Do I really have to do that again?"  He forgot to bring out one of our dishes, which would have been forgivable had we been able to find him to tell him.  Instead, after taking our order, he disappeared for the rest of the meal.  We ended up grabbing a bus boy to get us our spinach.  Glasses went unfilled, plates uncollected.  I've had better service at Olive Garden.Hum... maybe I am spoiled by the original location in NY. For this place, I wasn't feeling it.
Atomsphere felt more like a Denny's, light seems a bit dim, it was annoyingly dim.
Service could be better, I attempted to wave a waiter/waitress/hostess down to get my check, but they seem to all ignore me.
Took me about a good 10 mins to finally get someone attention, and additional 5 mins to get my bill.

Their pastrami sandwich was just okay, tasted more like a typical pastrami sandwich you can get anywhere.
Maybe I came in with too much hope for this place, but at the time we arrive, it was probably a given when there was no line.
I should have taken it as a hint that this place wasn't a hit in Vegas.

Will I come back? Nope. 
Will I recommend this place? Nope.
Was the sandwich picture worthy? NOT all at.It only gets a 2 because the girl tending bar was so great. Movie star quality looks and a very nice person to boot. 

I have eaten at STACK before and thoroughly enjoyed it. 

This time, 10/11/11, the placed was packed with conventioneers. I sat at the bar. I ordered the Surf and Turf from the full menu. The Surf was the size of my left forefinger and I do not have large fingers. It was way over cooked and was flavorless. The Turf was a hockey puck sized piece of beef, more like 5 oz. at best, tough and gristly with no discernible beef taste. I had the Adult Tater Tots on the side, which were regular Tater Tots with some cheese infused into them. Oh, there was some other thing on the plate which might have contained some potato product. 

The bill for this "feast" came to $74. I had one bottle of Stella Artois. I left a $10 tip only because this gorgeous lady bartender was so nice. 

The place WAS packed! The kitchen may have been overwhelmed, but that is no excuse for serving up a lousy meal. They had no problem taking my $84. 

I don't know right now if I can trust STACK enough to give them another try.I used to get take out from here 2-3 times per month, then a few months ago I felt there was a terrible combination of increased prices and lower quality.  I always thought of Pita Jungle as an inexpensive option, I could grab take out for the two of us for low-$20's, then I realized I was paying $35 +/- and multiple times getting home to find something wrong with our order.  Maybe it's my mentality:  once I'm used to paying a certain amount for a restaurant, that becomes its value, and in my opinion the large increase made the price here beyond their value.This was the third time I ate there.  The quality of food was not as good as it used to.  The fruits are not fresh and the meat dishes are greasy.  Well, what you cannot complaint is the price, which is cheap and the dining area is clean.I went here with my boyfriend over a month ago. We had heard so many good things about it, we had to go! It was a random Friday morning around 10:00. It was pretty full. Which was a good sign, at first. After a brief wait, we sat down and looked at our menus. When the waitress first came over we ordered speciality coffee drinks. In the meantime we continued to look at the menu. Once we were ready we put the menus to the side and started talking. I noticed that people next to us had ordered and just gotten their food while we were sitting there and we had still to order and get our drinks. 15 minutes goes by and our waitress finally takes our orders. Meantime the other couple is finishing up their meal we have still to receive either part of our meal. Another 10 minutes, our waitress comes over to tell us the coffee bar is backed up. 25 minutes? of not receiving our drinks? How hard is it to make a coffee drink and add a little flare on the side? Anyhow, my drink comes first, by itself. Then our food, then 5 minutes into our food, his drink.  Seriously? Maybe you could let us know before we order them that we won't get them for 30 minutes.

No matter how good the food was the service was awful. I don't think we will ever go back. Mid-meal we asked for waters and that took 10 minutes alone, I eventually had to stand up and ask another waitress. No thank you.

Hash House A No No.I have to agree that service here is non-existant.  My friend and I went for a late lunch 3 P.M.   We were one of three couples seated and yet the service was awful.  I had to ask the waitress twice to fill my glass only to look over and see her sitting with another couple chatting.  I finally held up my glass and said "please!!"  Only then did I get my water.

The pan roast was nothing more than seafood stew and not nearly as good as the one my husband and I used to love at the Palms a few years ago.  
The Caesar salad was good, cold, and plentiful. 

The tile floor and walls makes it very noisy (cooks chatting, music, etc. )so conversation was difficult even though the place was empty.  
To it's credit, Tides is very clean, bright and well maintained.

Would we go back again?  No.  Too many other good seafood places.The ONLY reason I am giving 2 stars instead of 1 is because they do have pretty good sushi.  HOWEVER - the hype about this place is so overdone that the staff has a huge attitude and they do not know how to treat guests.  

My husband and I went around 7:30 on a Thursday night.  We were staying at the Venetian (the hotel connected to the restaurant), made reservations for both the restaurant and the nightclub.  After waiting an HOUR we finally got a table.  The place was dark, loud, and the layout made you feel very crowded.  It was difficult to see what we were eating, let alone have a conversation.  We dropped about $400 on dinner (we were celebrating and had a bottle of Veuve).  

After dinner was over, we said we had reservations for the nightclub, the entrance to the club was literally 20 feet from our table.  Well, we had to get up, go outside the club, stand in a long "special line" and then wait in another "special line" in order to pay a $20 cover to go back through the restaurant we just left, back up the stairs we just came down, in order to get in.  

Pathetic.Used Yelp to locate a place to connect with two friends staying near the airport. Pressed for time and not really familiar with what's in the immediate area, so decided to hook up here. The Doubletree - place has to be good, right?

Wrong! This place is an embarrassment to the Doubletree/Hilton brand. It does have the exorbitant pricing you'd expect (when I walked in my buds were waiting and first comment I heard was - you wanna order one of the $5 Ice Tea's? lol). But it is in a state of disrepair and needs a serious facelift. I couldn't justify paying the prices shown on the menu. That coupled with the price we forked out for a few beers had us QUICKLY looking for another  place.

This was one of those RARE occasions that Yelpers left me hangin...I cant speak for the rest of the food here but I fancy myself quite a wing expert and they were terrible here due to being overcooked. Super overpriced like everything else on the menu, I paid like 14 bucks with tip for a take out order that I wanted to eat in my room because this place is LOUD as shit and definitely for a party crowd. 

Thats all well and good and this place looks awesome as a bar to go check out if you love country music. 

However, its tough to mess up wings and you had better make sure you don't when you charge me $12 for an order. 

Sorry Toby, I know you're not as good as you once were. But I sure hope the rest of your food is better then the wings.Average place. Nothing memorable.Shockingly disappointed!  We went to SDC last night for dinner.  Good meal as usual until it came to the bill.  It would appear as though the Spotted Donkey now has a mandatory 20% gratuity for a party of 5 or more.  This came as a bit of a surprise even though we typically tip 18%-20% for their good service.  What was really surprising was that our "party of 5" consisted of 3 adults, a 4 year old and a 20 month old.  What was a satisfying meal of a sudden became marginal.Completely mediocre food and surly service...this just isn't how I remembered a buffet in Las Vegas.  None of the food was great, but there was a lot of it.  The seafood was obviously frozen; I had to rip the crab legs apart with a fork and knife because there the cracker thing would only bend the shell, it was so saturated with water.  The bacon was undercooked and greasy, the sushi tasteless, the prime rib overdone, etc.  There was nothing there I would eat again.  I was really unimpressed, and my two dining companions were also less than thrilled.  It was 75 bucks for the three of us, and it wasn't worth it.I have heard nothing but rave reviews for this place but I just wasn't impressed  in the least. We ordered the spaghetti bolognese, meat balls, lemon chicken and caprese salad. Caprese salad was small but the buffalo mozzarella was tasty..nothing special though. The meat balls were phenomenal and thy was the saving grace of this place. For $17 I thought we would get more than 2 meatballs but I went here expecting it to be expensive. The lemon chicken was the absolute worst I have ever had. I don't mind when bones are in the chicken but when you leave the rib bones in then butcher the cchicken, you are left with tiny pieces of bone in everything. It was terrible taste and extremely hard to eat with all the bone pieces in it. $28 for half a chicken with loads of bone...no thanks. $30 for a normal size portion of spaghetti bolognese. All in all, cute ambiance and good service but certainly would not be coming back or recommending to anyone.I have been to the REAL Coke museum in ATL. This is really just a gift shop with some coke tastings. The prices in the tasting area are not bad at all, but again, it's no where near as cool as an actual museum. If you are really bored and want to sit down and eat a float, come here. If not, maybe go elsewhere?Jackrabbit "Stupid" Club...Ok for starters, the doormen are jerks. To  girls, boys, men, women, nice people, mean people, meat heads, sluts, small bunnies and other cute little fuzzy creatures.... JERKS.  Total snobbish meat heads demanding a cover to go in a bar where the music sounds like a low budget wedding reception. Even though Arizona is just a dry, hot and dusty place with no natural resources, people that hang in places like "Jackrabbit" are often snobbish and think they are extremely prestigious because they show up in outfits they shopped for all day trying to look like a coked up kid rock.... Inevitably they always end up with there panties around their ankles throwing up in a bathroom the size of a lunch pail with a mean poor person selling gum and smokes while trying to charge you to wipe your hands...

The bartenders always charge a different amount and could care less about making friends. When the hoochies come out to do their little show they basically push everyone and their drinks off the bar and sound off the fog horns. Out comes a few anorexic girls that dance around on the bar, clearly thinking they poop roses and fart sunshine....If you like songs like Charles in charge and YMCA in the middle of a house music set than this is the place to be.

Make sure you cash your paycheck because they are for sure charging you a cover...male OR female.

The only cool thing about this place is the wallpaper.This review is for the Easter brunch, which when you calculate in tax and tip cost over $100 per person. It was a huge disappointment. We have been to the Phoenician's amazing brunch a few times, and thought this would be similar quality, but we were wrong. 

First the service was bad from the beginning. We had reservations, but still waited in 90 degree heat for 20 minutes to be sat by what must be temps because they were so rude no fancy hotel would have hired them normally. We then found out Mimosas and Champagne were not included! I don't even drink them, but how could $100 NOT include at least 1 glass?

Nobody ever offered us coffee, and the juices they had out were warm. Our water glasses were empty immediately and only refilled when we asked. Did I mention it was 90 degrees - how could you not be filling water glasses and offering cold juice!?

The food they had was good, but there honestly wasn't much of a selection of typical brunch food. No eggs Benedict, no cheese tray, the fruit offering was less than what's in my fridge at home, no chicken or fish which is tough if you don't eat red meat, very few veggies, and what they claimed was a Mexican food section had beef only, no enchiladas, beans or even rice!

There were plenty of desserts, but most were bland. They didn't have ice cream or any cold desserts like you'd expect on a hot day. 

Again, what they had was good, and if this had been a $30 brunch on a non-holiday it would have been fine. For Easter when you're trying to enjoy a nice meal with family, it was very disappointing!I have eaten at lots of Mexican restaurant so I'm a pretty tough critic and this place was not that great.  I really was not that impressed. It's located inside the Cannery Casino so I'm sure it soaks up plenty of business from the people who are already there feeding slot machines their social security checks. I don't think I would go out of my way to walk through a smoky casino to eat here though. I find it funny that this place boasts "Las Vegas Review Journal The Best of Las Vegas 2008"... umm its 2011 that doesn't say much. I think the portions could have been better for the price. My girlfriend got fajitas and it was mostly vegetables. Overall our meal cost $29.17 before tip, I ate my whole meal and my girlfriend took home some vegetables.  I did like the chips and the two salsas and bean dip that came with it. If you're looking for an authentic Mexican restaurant go to VIVA ZAPATA'S it's just down the street on Craig and I-15 its way better.I visited Upper Deck on a Saturday of Memorial day weekend during a UFC fight.  We were looking to watch the fight and there were tons of TVs and large tables upstairs so we got just what we were lookin for as far as the sports part goes.  As for the grill part, I'll cut them some slack for me having picked a busy night and weekend, but my drinks took a long time to get there and the second one was wrong.  I would have given a more favorable rating except that the food wasn't great either.  I ordered a philly cheesesteak with potato salad and some wings.  The wings were pretty good but the rest was kind of blah.Gay nightlife is Vegas is sad.

We went to Piranha, because we were in the neighborhood. They had a line at 2:30 on Friday, so Saturday - we returned for the full experience. We thought, hey, we never see that in SF. Must be a good sign.

Signs can be misleading.

The club is an interesting space, it's got a VIP area (who knows why) and then a general floor. Everything is small, bars are laced through the area along with people who were awfully cocky. Drinks were crappy and uber-expensive, I had a Three Olives Grape and soda for $10. And it tasted more like Perrier with Splenda.

There was a go-go boy here who couldn't dance at all. It was like watching a limp piece of beef flop around. Yuck. You can tell if a go-go boy is straight or not, by the way he dances. And this one was straight. The other one was the better "straight" go-go boy.

A Piranha with a lack of a bite. Maybe, next time it would be worth it to do VIP. But other than, as the old saying goes . . . "there's no place like home."They need more help in service !!!!  I've been here maybe 5 or 6 times over the course of a few years.  Most of the times were because of Ichiza being too long of a wait or forgetting to make reservations there.  This particular night a friend wanted to go , so I agreed, hoping to see a new and improved place.  Wrong !  
     We went on a Saturday night.  The place wasn't crowded, maybe 6 tables full max.  There were two waitresses working and a guy sitting at the counter helping out whenever he wanted ( maybe owners kid ?? ) It started alright when the waitress came by and got our order.      When the food started coming , she didn't bring any plates or utensils.  We got it after waiting a few minutes when a different waitress brought another round of food.  While she was there we ordered some Kurosawa sake bottle.  During the course of our wait for the other orders , I observed, us getting the wrong plate of food, having to reorder because waitress said we didn't order a certain dish, never getting the sake ( she said they were out, blamed that other waitress who took our order was new)  , table next to us also asked for extra bowls and never got it ( had to get up and grab it themselves).  
            The food and prices were decent, but service was horrendous . The food kept this place from being a one star rating .  It's no wonder this place will never get the crowds like Ichiza.Disclaimer:  We just won a $1K on the quarter slot machine.

Occasion:  Weekend Getaway with Boyfriend and My Whole Family
                     
Venue:  Vegas, Baby! Smith and Wollensky is a steak/lobster restaurant on the strip across from Monte Carlo.

Ambiance/Decor: Americana. Could be used as a venue for Gangster Movies in the 30's. Rustic Wood Tables.  Real clothtowels in the bathroom instead of papertowels. 

Social Scene: Loud and rowdy group of friends at one table dressed to the nines. Two couples (including me and boyfriend) trying to have a quiet dinner in Vegas.

Service:  Excellent! 

What we ordered:
Salud!:  A glass of Smith and Wollensky Napa Reserve $18
               Iced Tea    $ 4.75
Food:  2 Whole Lobsters and 10 oz Steak for me and BF $59 each
            4 pcs Oysters on Half-Shell $16

Total: $193.90 including tax and tip

Overall:
1.  Being with my Asian family who loves buffets, BF and I wanted to have a nice quiet dinner by ourselves that will not include stuffing ourselves with 40 dishes.  So, we sneaked out!

2.  Believe it or not, the restaurants on the strip were closed at 11PM except the bars and clubs. Smith and Wollensky was the only place that was open  until midnight.  That's how we ended here by accident.

3.  The dinner was disappointing considering how expensive it was.  The steak was burnt (no,not charbroiled) dry and bland that BF and I ended up dipping the steak in the sauce that came for the lobster.    The small lobster came with a rich sauce and hot melted butter on the side. It was rubbery. BF said maybe because we were the last customers for the evening. Not good enough excuse for a $200 dinner!

4.  If you are in Vegas, skip this place. There are so many fine dining available out there!

I'll keep this review short and sweet since WHAT HAPPENS IN VEGAS STAYS IN VEGAS.   One thing's for sure though, Boyfriend and I had a memorable and  romantic weekend in Las Vegas! ;)Haven't been to the Orleans dinner buffet in quite a while...went there tonight, a Monday, for their prime rib featured buffet.  Guess the prices have recently been raised, with my club card, it still cost me $16.50.

Prime rib was dry (I tried it 2 or 3 times--the au jus didn't help...recovering from over eating while I type this), the rest of the selections were truly average and unremarkable.

Compared to other LAS buffets on a Monday night, there are much better (a) values and (b) quality to be had.

Very disappointed, unlikely I'll return to the Orleans feeding frenzy in the future.

Didn't use to be like this...Overrated and overpriced.  The rooms in the old section of the hotel are bad.  

The only worthwhile parts of CP are the gaming floor (great sports book) and the food (MeSa is great), but you can do that- and shop in The Forum- without overpaying to stay here.This review is based strictly on the room and nothing more.  I give two stars because my room was showing it's age and was pretty shabby.  i thought casinos like Caesars would keep their rooms always in good (if not great) shape but this wasn't the case.  And to top things off I ended up getting one of the rooms without a door separating the bedroom and the bathroom.  You could have easily walked in on someone using the bathroom...is this how they do it in Rome ;-)   I wished I would have stayed at Paris across the street.  I would have even saved a few dollars.Food is okay but service need to be improved.
Appetizers were as cold as made day before. Bread/ Naan came 10 minutes after getting curry dishes.
Waiter does not even make an eye-contact. Need to ask for dishes 2-3 times on weekday evening. 
Do Not visit restroom- if you do so you will not eat food. It need to be cleaned.  
Not at all worth the cost.What happened to this place! This used to be a great club to gamble and party. I don't know if this is a sign of what is going on at the Palms, but this place was as dead as the hotel itself. Good to hear that this place will be opening elsewhere. The new owners of the Palms are trying to squeeze profit rather than build the casino back to where it was. Place is only getting worse.High Prices. No Service.  All the same merchandise you can get elsewhere.

Oh and these vegan pinko commie tree huggers don't carry hunting, shooting, archery supplies.  The outdoors goods are weak too.

If you like racquet sports and carrying a fanny pack this might be your shop - cause it ain't mine!

This is the next Borders Books.So, I've been going to to Allure for pedi's for about a year.  They're located very close to my house so it's mainly been a convenience thing.  The techs are hit and miss.  Some are awesome and really do a good, thorough job. But overall its usually a pretty neutral experience.  The last couple of times I went in they were just rude.  The girl who did my last pedi  (about 2 weeks ago) got rude when I wouldn't accept her upsales......did a sloppy job on my polish and wouldn't fix a mistake when she made when she slipped on my flip flop.  On Thursday (NY eve) I went in for a mani....the sloppiest mani I have EVER had.  She soaked my right hand for all of 10 seconds before starting my cuticles.  When I flinched when she cut my finger she slammed her tools on the table, grabbed the water bowl that my left hand was still in (slopped water), stood up and said, "No manicure, polish change".  When she came back, I tried to explain I did want a manicure, not only a polish change.  She raised her voice and said that I was too jumpy "Everything hurt you".  Well, she did my polish....horrible job!! About 1/4" from my cuticle....it looked just dreadful.  While I was waiting for my polish to dry there was a man giving another women a pedi......she told him 3 times (!!!) he was hurting her and he just laughed and said "it tickles"??  She said NO, it HURTS.  I'm done with this place.  There are plenty of these cookie cutter shops around.....They need to re-check their customer service skills.  This was just wrong!!Very interesting experience - Went there since it's close to where I'm visiting.

Two people enrtered Chen's before I did and were perusing the menu so I did too !

There were no combo's in the evening and I was not impressed with the look of the place nor the prices on the menu.

The people ahead of me handed the menu back and left and seeing the sullen reaction of the manager, so did I.I don't know why my stomach gets upset every time I eat at this particular restaurant, I've eaten at other Panda Express and loved it. I just can't eat here. I hope u chose wiselyThe grilled chicken sandwich I had today was so salty, it ruined my "healthy" meal. Ridiculous! I couldn't even eat it.Great points: 
-open 24 hours 
-Computers you can pay by the hour for with games pre-installed 
- An entire wall of minis to purchase 
- Great selection of pen and paper RPG books and their supplements 
- One of the few places I have found that have dice sets 
- pre detailed RPG tables, with hills and grass and such, along with tables for card games. 
- Snacks for sale 

NOW then. This place would be 4 stars if it weren't for one thing: It is filthy. 

The game stations are cramped into a small area with no walls, just the look of the cramped smelly boys/men crammed into there makes me praise God I have a computer at home. 

The counter is dirty along with all the game tables and everything is just sort of piled wherever. 

The microwave they have in the store leaves the place stuck with the stench of hot pockets and pie in a bag. The mingle of smells in such an enclosed place makes me want to vomit at times. 

If only they would clean the place up and keep the microwave in a separate room I would go there as my first stop for DND needs, instead it is always last on my list.Here's my honest review.

PROS:
-Great location; middle of greater Phoenix area; close to ASU; freeway extremely close
-3 pool/hot tub areas
-Gym; free fitness classes offered monthly
-Parking garage
-Indoor corridors
-Granite countertops
-Water, satellite, & internet bundled in
-Maintenance staff is pretty prompt and helpful

CONS:
-Abominable, unintelligent staff/management
-Drunk party people belting 'til the wee hours of the morning
-GOD AWFUL INTERNET SERVICE.  I'm certain Pavlov Media is the antichrist.
-Awkward floor plans that make furniture placement near-impossible
-NOOOO storage space in kitchen; non-functional kitchens
-If you have an issue in any way, expect to have no help (aside from maintenance)


Do not take these list of cons lightly.  I'm serious.  At the price of rent, we shouldn't have to deal with such silly issues.  

i've lived in two different floor plans here over about a year and a half.I just bought a pork crown roast here that is MUCH bigger than what I expected.  Almost a month ago I ordered a 12-14 rib roast, but when I went to pick it up, all they had were 19-20 rib roasts.  I would have refused it, but wasn't sure I could find another this close to Christmas Eve.  I'm sure it will be excellent quality, but I don't appreciate how they padded my order by about a third.  I have to go find a larger roasting pan and adjust cooking times on an already very busy day.  If/when you order, specify exactly what size/weight you will accept and have a backup plan readyThe machines are really old and about a quarter of the ones up stairs were out of service. It looks like they are shutting down for a day in July- so hopefully the renovations include new equipment.A sign on the wall says this Subway served subs to the United States Secret Service during a Bush visit to Phoenix. Wow! Unfortunately, the fact that it served subs to the people who take bullets for the president still does not make its subs anything special.

Of course, if you like lettuce, by all means, come here fast. If it's the end of the world and I'm craving a sandwich, I'll throw a brick through the window of a Subway--this location or any other subway. God knows they probably have, without fear of hyperbole, a million bags of vacuum-packed shredded lettuce under their counters.

Anyway, did I say that someone whose job it is to take a bullet for the president has eaten a sandwich from this Subway?I have been here a few times now, and just not been impressed. The stylists are OK, nothing great. There prices are decent, but I think a little on the high side for the quality you get. My biggest complaint comes from the customer service. I have called after hours or on Sundays when they are closed several times and left a message. They will NOT call you back. If you are going to have an answering machine then use it and call people back. I guess business is good if they can afford to not return calls and go else where. I will not be returning here.I really want to give South Point four or five stars - some areas are amazing. The front line staff, for example, were always incredibly friendly and helpful. The room itself was nice enough for a 4 star (though by no means as flashy as some others) and the location is surprisingly pleasant, only 15 minutes from the strip at most via I-15. 

However, I'm not going back. There were just too many minor annoyances night after night that weren't solved around our room. Alone, they'd be fine, but all together, it was enough to keep me from coming back.

-The iron was broken. We asked for another - it took four hours and another call to get.
-The blow dryer cradle fell clear out of the wall when I tried to use the blow dryer.  
-They only stocked two towels each night - even after we asked for more.
-They only stocked two pillows each night - they got that right after a couple nights

...and so on. I don't want to be one of those reviewers who get into every problem, but you get the picture. Nothing that ruined my time there, but collectively it was just too much. 

On the plus side, the resort fee ($14) gets you internet access and boarding passes, the buffet is quite good, the casino ain't bad, and there's plenty of convenient shops (not for hardcore shopping, but picking up extras) within two minutes driving distance.good Chinese food is hard to find in LV especially being from Cali, the only good thing about this place is that it's close to my house and it's similar to Panda express except its made to order.  I usually have to add a lot of chili oil and soy sauce to my orders to give it more flavor but besides that, all I can say is that it's 5 mins from my house which is a plus when I'm craving chinese and don't want to drive to chinatown (spring mtn)Had two bad experiences with this particular Villa Pizza...and the problem is always with the skank that answers the phone...had a coupon...she said are you sure it is ours?  when we got there we gave her the money the dummy gave the money back because she can not ring the register....on the Wednesday before we call for a pizza and the same girl (Janeth) answered...it was 8:30 p.m. half our before closing...she said are you sure you got the right place we close at 9...The management really needs to deal with this girl..very poor customer service...losing business because the this idiot...A bit overpriced. Food not as good as advertised. Our group bought food from 3 of the places here and were not satisfied with the quality.Every time I come here the ask me to "pull around" after taking my money. No, give me my food now or give me back my money. The looks you get after saying this is amusing, they don't know what to do, and what do you know? My food pops right out! Thank you sir may I have anotherWorst pizza experience ever!!!  First, we ordered a large supreme pizza and it came to our table half baked, when you cut into the sausage, it was quite pink on the inside.  The Manager said that there were trainees in the kitchen.  OK.  Let's go for another pizza.  The 2nd pizza was delivered to our table and I could see that a couple of the outer crust of a few pieces were burnt.  That didn't look good.  We served ourselves a couple of pieces and found that the bottom of the pizza was black and burnt.  We have been to this location on numerous occasions without incident.  It just wasn't our night OR theirs?  :(What is it about Mimi's that makes me instantly feel 10 lbs heavier as soon as I walk through the door?  Maybe they import humid air in here?  or maybe it's the soul food being whipped up in the kitchen? 

 I've eaten here on a few occasions (not my choice) and both times the food was ok (I opted for salad).  The bread is quite good and so are the desserts.  I am just not a huge fan of the menu and style of cooking.  If you do like calorie packed comfort food then please do stop in for a bite.wow, where do I begin?  It took us an hour and a half to check in.  Our first room appeared to have been ransacked.  Beer bottle caps on the floor, the items from the cabinet were strewn all over the floor, beds unmade , towels everywhere, extremely dusty on the tables, a HOT mess.  The next room (which was an upgrade)  had been shampooed that morning, so the carpet was  WET....very WET.. tried to call the front desk and waited for over 30 minutes with no answer.  So, had to go back down to the front desk and  while they apologized, it took them about 15 minutes for them come back and tell us what we were going to receive.  (2 free buffet meals).  The service at the HOTEL in general was horrible.  From the front desk, the phone service, the waitresses at the pool, even the server at PRICE MARKET (the buffet restaurant).  The hallways were ALWAYS dirty.  This place is a hot mess. Yes, there are some perks... but geez, had to go through so much to receive them.Let me start by saying that the hotel itself is pretty cool and its awesome that it is in a mall so there are tons of stores nearby for convenience! The rooms are okay, nothing super fancy, but there is no fridge, which sucked in vegas!! But what really made the stay at this hotel horrible was the manager...and a few of the staff members. The manager could give a shit less about her PAYING customers and treated me absolutely horribly. Her staff weren't much better and weren't exactly jumping up and down to assist me. I lost my wallet in our first room (before we upgraded to a better view room) and no one at the front desk/concierge desk were helpful when trying to help me get a hold of someone in security, who always seemed to be missing! Finally, I got a hold of someone and they were able to find the wallet, but the security people were rude as well. I do have to say that I am thankful to the housekeepers who found my wallet and were gracious enough to turn it in. They were all very friendly passing by in the hallway. 

This was my birthday trip and I did a lot of research before choosing a hotel because I wanted it to be a great experience for a decent price and I feel like I made a mistake staying here because of the horrible customer service. Where I come from, typically the customer is always right, and even when the customer is wrong, still treat them with respect and kindness because they are paying to stay at your hotel, when there are TONS of other places to choose from on the strip. I will not be staying here again!Consistent with the kiddy theme that is the Excalibur Casino & Hotel, this uber cheesy event is best served for a teenage date or a family fun outing.  Though I came here with a group of like minded youngins, I couldn't help but think if this was the type of place Ralph Macchio (AKA Daniel-san in Karate Kid) would bring Elizabeth Shue for a date.  I determined at the end of the show that it was not only karate kid worthy but totally not worth my $40 ticket.

The show takes place in an arena like venue, with cascading stadium style seats that surround a dusty pit made for folks on a horse.  Once the show begins, the characters that eventually joust each other to death while speaking in Medieval dialects are in character from start to finish.  Yes, this means cheesy lines, plenty of fake violence, and forced laughs / gasps from the audience for a good 90 minutes.  The waitresses are dressed like skimpy maids and while most of them were hot, something tells me they hate working there.  The chicken dinner that was served like it was in the middle ages, roasted and with little flavor and no utensils.  I suppose a pizza would've been asking for too much.

Allergy sufferers beware, if the seats are near the dusty arena floor, then watch out for the horse dust that will eventually cloud up and rise.   I was coughing and gasping by the end of the show, no meds would've been strong enough to prevent all of the hacking.

Unless members in the party are younger than 15, spend a bit more money and see something else.  Magic shows, concerts, The Blue Man Group etc. could beat the premise of this weak production any day.The spicy chicken was good, what you expect to get when you decide to eat from Teriyaki Madness. The macaroni salad however, was not, and I was quite disappointed. The coolness of the macaroni salad against the spicy of the chicken is my favorite part of the meal. Based on my most recent meal, this TM location doesn't know how to maintain a recipe. I spoke with a Mgr. named Jose who told me they hadn't changed the recipe but they did change the mayonnaise they use. To me it tasted like less mayo had been used and more celery had been added... whatever it was, it wasn't pleasing to my palate. After calling the location to inquire about a changed recipe, I understand why customers come here to vent. Small business owners, franchise owners/operators, PLEASE train your employees how to answer the phone!Everyone else seems to love this place but me. I had a very strange experience there. First off, the food was average but that wasn't my main problem. It wasn't even that the service was bad just....weird.  I eat at plenty of ethnic places so I'm used to people not understanding English but the gentleman would come to our table, pretend to take our order, leave and then the woman would come back and take it again. This happened over and over- "Can I get a refill on my soda?" man nods, woman comes back and asks what we wanted. It wasn't just us. There was a large family eating there and they were really having problems. The biggest issue for me was when I ordered something (crispy pork skin something or other) the woman looked at my date and said "That is pork skin, she won't like it. She should order something else" Uh, hello? I'm sitting right here! I think I can figure out that crispy pork skin means just that, crispy pork skin! Then I ordered some spring roll thing (Sorry, its been a couple of months now and I don't remember exactly what everything was) and again, she looks at my date and says "She'll have to roll those herself. She should order something else" WTF? Did I just become invisible or what? Trust me, lady, I have rolled plenty of my own, spring rolls and otherwise! It was one of the most bizarre experiences I have ever had in a restaurant in the states. I've been in other countries where I was systematically ignored in favor of speaking to the man I was with but not in my own neighborhood! So, personally, I'll stick w/Little Saigon in a cute little house in Old Town Glendale where I'm dotted on by the flamboyant waiter and the food is better.Having eaten good Korean food, I have to say this wasn't very good. I wish it was because it's close and I'd like to have a good Korean food place close to me. The food was merely average or slightly below. I may have to give it another try though based on MJ K.s review. I might have just gone on a bad day.Ordered the "Carne Asada & Huevos" and I requested the eggs medium. I think that threw them for a loop. They forgot my salsa and sadly they never got around to bringing it. The carne asada was of good quality but was served lukewarm, which tells me it was sitting. Oh well I left full at least.Only two stars today, we were seated immediately. It took them 15 min to get us a waiter. Apps came out quick, we had to ask for salad dressing, it took another 15 to get our drinks. After several requests I asked about our pizza & finally got the "two more minutes", 10 min later we had pizza. It was a total of 45 min from the time we ordered pizza until we got it!! They didn't even ask how anything was or comp us anything for waiting. Did I mention the kids fell asleep waiting on their food!! Oh well, this will be another location coming off the list.I was very excited when my plans opened up and my family and I were able to go to first friday.

My excitement didn't last through the entire night. 

I went to their website, to try and decipher which lot to park in, how the shuttle worked, and blah blah blah. Navigating down town is difficult as it is. We finally found parking, that was close to the event, they charge $10. Wowza.

A lot of the artists......came off rude. A lot of them didn't even say "hi" when we walked up to their booth. What a turn off! What would compel me to buy your overpriced "art" when you don't even have a decent personality?

When you are looking for something to eat, make sure you walk ALL the way through the event. We settled on the "hummus factory" truck, because we didn't see the other ones, and were slightly disappointed....There were more promising ones across the street.

There was some odd show going on. This chick had flaming batons, and was belly dancing to a slipknot sounding song..... Later, a "zombie" came in and it turned into a zombie fire fight. We walked away asking ourselves, "W T F did we just watch?"

So, okay food, elementary school looking art, and random music playing.

Reminds me more of a swap meet than anything else. I don't know if we will be back.I've visited Steve's for the live music they have occasionally. The food is good but not always top-notch. Wait staff is not always on the ball and we've had to visit the bar for drink refills. Last time I visited I was disappointed to see that the menu had changed and the desserts I LOVE are now gone. I'll still go back for the music though.I was really disappointed with this mall.  I went in to kill some time and I couldn't shop at any of the stores.  They were either all for teenagers or people with families. They had this one over priced "boutique" that sold expensive skanky dresses.  If the dress barely covers my a$$, it shouldn't cost $80+. I'm going else where.I didn't realize this was a chain until I got my receipt.  Damn it!  I like to frequent local businesses when I travel the country.  Oh well!  I pulled into the last open spot in the parking lot meaning the place was packed.  I was told I could sit in the bar area and find my own spot or wait for a table to open up.  I opted for the bar area and found a small table right away.  The portions here are huge.  I had the BBQ bacon burger.  It was juicy and good.  However, I guess when you order it without greens and tomatoes it means you don't want sauce either.  Their beer selection isn't half bad.  I had the CJ Hefeweizen which was tasty.  The service was slow as shit.I have heard so much about this place, so I finally tried ifor my first time. It did not live up to the hype that was built. It was decent service and decent food, but not worth the price....$12.99 for a half rotisierre chicken. Frys gives you a whole one for $5.99 and it tastes the same. I guess I was paying for the dish soap used to wash the LARGE plates...so large, there was so much space on them. Just saying, if I am going to pay the prices charged there, I expected MUCH better. I still may go, if someone can convince me I ordered the wrong item.Place is upscale no doubt. nothin much under 10 bucks. and it's nice inside. seat yourself. The hardwood chairs suck, very uncomfortable chairs. i recommend the booths!

I got the Bacon cheddar Burger with fries. 

Place filled up really quickly, and since I'm only one person. I was forgotten quickly after i ordered... took awhile but the food finally came out, and the fries were cold. also had to go to the bar twice to get a refill on my iced tea. definitely felt very unimportant and lost all that hope of any decent service

won't recommend this place for it's service or food. the burger was ok, nothing special for the price paid.Had a $20 off coupon.  Service was slow and waiter was a bit "gruff".  Took forever for our bread to come  even though people that arrived after us were receiving their bread.  When it did come the butter was cold and unspreadable.  Had to basically put clumps of butter over the bread.  

I ordered a pumpkin martini and it was excellent.  I also had the lobster bisque which was, admittedly, very good.  The prime rib was 16oz.  It was actually too big.  I ordered it medium rare, I like it bloody, and it came out probably a little underdone.  I expected it to be very tender and basically melt in my mouth.  It didn't.  It was tougher than expected.  

Overall it was a little bit of an underwhelming experience and if I had to choose a steakhouse in Vegas again I'd go elsewhere.I don't know what disappointed us more here: the service or the food?! Perhaps the poor service wins this battle, since the initial interaction with our server set the mood. I imagine we're not the first people to stay at Excalibur who decide to use the $20 credit here, since it's not valid at their buffet. We weren't going to waste the credit at a bar, where drinks are free if you're gambling. My husband and I stopped in here a little less than two hours before the Jersey Boys show, playing down the Strip at Paris. Doors to the show open half an hour early and we were going to walk there, so we knew we'd only have time for appetizers which was fine with us.

We presented our $20 credit upon ordering, as required, and told the servers we had a show to get to. He then asked when it was, and when we told him insisted we had time for entrees and rolled his eyes at us when we declined. I get in big trouble with hubby when I do this, and he was most unhappy at the unprofessional gesture from our server. 

Bread was brought to the table as we waited for sliders for my husband, a Caesar salad for me, and seasoned fries to share. Although my husband ordered the sliders rare, and we are really comfortable with steaks cooked less-than-rare, the ground beef was cold and uncooked in the center of his sliders, and his caramelized onions were uncooked as well. The seasoned fries were unseasoned and a thick cut fry without much flavor. My Caesar salad was server without fresh pepper offered for it, and the croutons seemed like they were found in an old box, rather than house-made. 

Overall, the food disappointed but the service was the worst. We have no plans to stay at the Excalibur again, and without the free $20 credit for guests of the hotel, we won't be returning here either. They only get two stars because the hostess at the front was the only friendly face we encountered (she was super), and when we told her about the subpar experience as we left, she honestly wanted to make it right, but we assured her our decision to never return was everyone's fault but hers.One of our suppliers insists on taking us here for lunch about once a quarter.  It kinda sucks.  Not offensive, but awfully boring.  Things on the broad menu look like they should be better than they are.  Blah.

Plus we can't booze at lunch.  What I've had for booze here (nothing recent) has not been at all noteworthy.  Avoid.Nothing spectacular about the food...service was good and the fruity adult beverages/margaritas were tasty. Somehow, between 2 people, we ended up spending close to $50. We thought the waitress was being friendly, but after ordering drinks, it seemed like all she wanted to do was sell us more random crap to get a bigger tip. 
It was a nice change to see hockey on the big screen...Really signed said open and i wasnt the only one friend flew down from washington saw this on the food channel hey lets go hours said it was open wasnt the only one but closed what the f. Fix your signs or leave a note saying your closed during holidays.We were there last weekend and we went after watching le reve around 10ish. We had no problem getting in. It was definitely an older crowd (30-50). It's a lounge more than a club. Compared to tryst at the same hotel, it's probably 1/4 to 1/5 the size.Fairytale Brownies (NY Chocolate Show) - Too crumbly for my taste. Eileen Spitalny and David Kravetz, did I hear right? You sold your soul to the devil for money. Over 2.5M brownies made annually is impressive. Say it isn't so that you sell frozen brownies (per Sophie M.). Callebaut chocolate is a nice touch, but frozen isn't cool in my book.

Pics: http://www.meetup.com/teamfoodie/photos/477262I tried the Siopao, a pork one and a chicken one.  The chicken one was more interesting, but I liked the taste of the pork one better.  The sauce for them was unremarkable.  That about sums it up:  unremarkable overall.The most exciting thing about my meal here was drinking a frozen bellini and watching two men eat with prostitutes. It gave Nick and I some serious conversation topics from why would you pay for dinner for a call girl to do you think they have them on a nightly rate and a great debate on how much that would cost where we pooled all of our TV/movie knowledge and used inflation rates to determine our answers. The rest was just Italian food that someone I know could probably make just as well for me. Nick and I split a chopped Italian salad and Rigatoni Bolognese. I would have rather had Burger Palace.

The service however was outstanding. And that always goes a long way in my book.I'm not sure if this is the best Fox restaurant. As of this week, I went into sauce twice. I found a hair in my mac and cheese the first time and then the second time I went I found another hair in my pizza. Can the cooks shave? Maybe wax? It's very displeasing to the eye.I'm very picky when it comes to fast food Mexican.  It can be simple but it has to be good.  This place had very  matter of fact service.  The food was done in a quick time frame but it just wasn't that cheap or that good to bother going back to.  Ordered a bean and cheese burrito with potato added to it.  The tortilla was delicious.  It smelled and tasted fresh made.  However it was a bit burned.  Then the beans were very average with thick shreds of cheddar cheese.  The potatoes were gross in my opinion.  They were very big chunks of breakfast style potatoes with lots and lots of pepper.  I am not a fan of pepper.  Also ordered the 5 rolled tacos with cheese and guacamole.  My children did not care for the "meat" in the middle.  The guacamole was a bit sour tasting.  I did like that the tacos were thickly rolled.  The outside was super crisp and the inside mushy.  That appealed to me....

We won't be back.My Husband and I were here a couple of weeks ago.  It was 8:00pm on a Friday night and the place was pretty empty, maybe two or three tables were occupied.  

We were there with another couple and ordered several margaritas, their combination platter and a side of guajillo mashed potatoes.  We ordered several different tacos, but the ones I was interested were the Camarones a la Diabla and the Fresh Lobster tacos.  The shrimp was WAY too spicy to enjoy.  I like a lot of heat in my food, but not when it overwhelms everything else.  On the other hand, the lobster and jimaca was bland and lackluster.

I would have to say their selection of tequilas are nice.  I had their Cucumber Margarita and it was very cool and refreshing.

We may come back if I get a hankering for margaritas, if nothing else.  Also, I thought we would be in for an inexpensive night, but I guess with the combo platter, four margaritas and a couple of beers, it came out to be just over $80 a couple.I was invited to come to this place on the spur of the moment.  I probably should have declined, but I do like Indian food and I figured I could order off the menu.  Yes, they do have a buffet here, but I hate buffets.

Allow me to digress about buffets briefly.  The first problem with them is that they encourage me to eat too much.  I always want to get my money's worth, so I stuff myself.  Not great.  Second problem is a bit more gross.  Any idea how many people wash their hands after going to the bathroom?  Maybe half?  And here is a row of food trays with utensils being handled by literally dozens of people, half of whom did not wash their hands recently.  And that doesn't include those who may be sick, or recently coughed/sneezed into their hands (without washing afterwards).  And those serving utensils are touching my food??  Uhhh...no.

So I order from the menu (more about the menu in a moment).  I'm not very hungry, so I just order a lentil soup with mixed vegetables in it (Sambar).  The waitress proceeds to the buffet line, grabs a bowl, and ladles the soup from the buffet into the bowl.  There's my sambar.  Served with one of those potentially toxic utensils I just mentioned.  Ugggh!  I wanted it from the kitchen where only one or two people who haven't washed their hands will handle it!!!!  Not cool.

The service itself was inattentive.  They seemed a bit understaffed.  Maybe someone missed work so they were short-handed?  Dunno.  But it was inattentive.  What interaction we did have with the servers was friendly.  The soup was very flavorful, but very lacking in lentils.  I expected to see lentils.  It was mostly broth with a few pieces of vegetable in it.  Disappointing.

And now for the menu...it featured a large variety of dishes.  That bit was good.  But every section that involved meat indicated the meat was halal.  Some argue that halal meat is more humane, but I do not believe that is true.  There are a few brief religious ceremonies/utterances that must be done before slaughtering the animal, but basically they hang it upside down and slit its throat while it's still conscious.  It then bleeds-out (probably at least 20-30 seconds before it passes out).  I do not see how that is more humane than the typical western method of stunning the animal first, then stringing it up and cutting the throat.  There is no suffering in the latter (if it's done properly).  I'm not squeamish about slaughtering an animal for food, and I do know where meat comes from.  The only reason to do it halal is religious, and I have a problem with inducing suffering without very good reason.  Ancient traditions that aren't really relevant to modern hygiene do not qualify in my opinion.  I'm not criticizing others' beliefs, but I do not share them and don't think I should have to partake in them.

They have plenty of vegan dishes, and that's fine.  My soup I believe was vegan.  I do wish she had brought me a fresh one from the kitchen instead of one from the buffet line.  Prices seemed a tad high to me, too.  But the place was busy, and clearly very popular with Indian people (most patrons appeared to be Indian).I hear the drinks are good so that might result in it getting more stars from me but as far as the food goes - meh. I made the mistake of getting the curry which I was leary about because most places that do a wide variety of cuisines tend to overextend their menu(i.e. a place that does mexican, american, chinese, indian, etc.) That'd just be weird. Well, I tried the curry and the problem was there is a lot of better, authentic curries at the nearby Indian restaurants so why pay the same price for something from the Cabana Room? The service was dreadful and we waited a long time to get our bill despite us being about the only customers there. I don't know, just didn't sit well with me.Ehhh I like the fact that its by the air force base and a Del Taco is in the parking lot but thats where it ends. At 2 am they have 1 cashier ONLY 1. While most others have 2 or 3 and arent afraid to call more. And the employees arent that bad. BUT the clientele who frequent this one are lacking in the way they dress and how they act. Plus the manager at the Mc Donalds acts like your not there. Hence the Del Taco in the parking lot with better food anyway.can't see any reason to dine here. The atmosphere was dull, the food ranged from OK to yuck (we tried to send one dish back, but they weren't interested), service was OK but not great, and they close early. Very disappointing. The best part of the experience was spinning the prayer wheels near the entrance, hopefully to spare our party from food poisoning.Nice design and atmosphere.  Very mediocre service.  Extensive menu that gets your hopes up, but I've never really had anything very good there.  As I live nearby, I can't wait until they are replaced by something else.  It seems popular, but I think people are all pretending to like it.  It's far from a bad place, but it's not good enough to go to in my opinion.I went there tonight for a take out and it took them an hour to finish my order, plus it took another 15 minutes to be bagged.  I saw my order on the counter ready for bagging, but nobody was minding it.  If I did not asked about my order, it will be just sitting there.  They also forgot to put dressing on my sashimi salad.   Hence, the 2 stars.Let me preface this by saying I got the all day buffet for free, and normally it runs $38. And free food always tastes anywhere from 2-2.5x better than food you pay for. 

Our first day in Vegas we hit up the Studio B Buffet at the M Resort, so needless to say More at Luxor was a step down...literally because the place is located in the basement of the Luxor. That said, it is easily the best food I've ever eaten inside of a basement. 

If you stick to the normal food here, it's hard to find much to complain about. First we had the breakfast buffet and the sausage, eggs, bacon, and omelette bar were solid and great for filling up to start the day.

 There were only two things on the breakfast buffet that were so bad I couldn't swallow a bite: the biscuits and gravy, and the sausage and egg "burrito." I don't know what was inside of that so-called burrito, but it damn sure wasn't anything I would ever use at home. The biscuits and gravy was more bland than disgusting, and after a night of downing straight shots of tequila with no problem, it should say a lot that I didn't have the courage to take more than one bite of their hard biscuit or nasty gravy. 

For dinner, it's pretty much standard Hometown Buffet or Golden Corrall food. Nothing here is going to blow you away like you would find at Wicked Spoon or Studio B, but  there are a few tasty items to be tried. First, the Buffalo Shrimp are pretty amazing. I've never had Buffalo Shrimp but I had to have eaten 2 plates of the shrimp alone. Second, the carved turkey was very good and paired with the mashed potatoes and gravy, I have to say was surprisingly Thanksgiving-like. So definitely some decent food for dinner to be had but there were more than a few duds. 

The pizza - Imagine if Digiorno came out with a new pizza called "Flavorless." That's More's pizza in a nutshell. The crust and texture were Digiorno, but the sauce and everything else tasted like moist paper towels. 

The Chicken - I don't know how you fuck up chicken because it has to be up there with scrambled eggs on the list of "The Most Impossible Foods to Ruin" but More manages to do a great job at doing a poor job preparing chicken. Tons of fat, no flavor, gooey texture, etc. It tasted the way I would imagine chewing on a human kidney would be. 

So all in all, More is great if you can get it at a discount and stick to basic foods offered in order to recharge your batteries and get something in your stomach. However, if you're spending the full $26 to get int he buffet, I would suggest the extra $14 at Wicked Spoon or heading down the road to Flamingo's Paradise Buffet for the same price.Why oh why do I keep going back to this place?? The service is horrible. I have never once had even decent service at this location. Last night I watched my server flirt with every other server in the building as I waited for my drinks. I watched him walk around like he was in a frat house as I waited to place my order. I shrieked as he questioned everything that I ordered five times. I assumed he was just being thorough.  I listened to him gossip about partying with the other guys(past, present, and future) and the girls he was scamming on as I waited 58 mins for wings and pizza. I now know far more about the lives of the staff here than I'd care to know. When he finally decided to bring HALF OF MY ORDER, because he forgot to ring in the other half, he was apologetic and ran off to ring in the forgotten items, which he had originally confirmed 5 times, once again running away leaving our glasses empty. I watched him watch me as he paced anxiously awaiting the food he forgot and tell the other servers so they could stare at us as well. Once he noticed I was watching him he completely abandoned our table and the area. At this point, we are 67 minutes into this dismal restaurant experience where we have empty glasses, half our food and no silverware to attempt to eat what we do have. All the other servers were congregating across the room so we couldn't ask them either. We were atleast able to eat some wings with no napkins, like heathens, but hey those were good I have to admit. Finally he brings the rest of our order and then runs away from our table and abandons us once again with absolutely nothing we needed(napkins, drinks, silverware, condiments, etc.) and we didn't  have a chance to say anything. He was outta there BUT he did come back eventually... to give us our bill!! Thanks guy! We did talk to a manager and she apologized. It's unfortunate that they have good wings here. I have never had a good experience at this location. They keep inviting me back and I keep giving them chances and it gets worse and worse. That was their last chance. Lost a fan!!My wife and I are Vegas locals and Mexican food is a favourite. When South Point opened its new Mexican restaurant we had to give it a try, especially as it is only a short drive.

The first thing I noticed about Baja Miguel's is that it looks more like a cafe than a Mexican restaurant. The colours, decor and layout of the tables doesn't make for the most intimate setting.

Before our meal we were given Salsa, bean dip and guacamole. I can't comment on the guac since neither of us like it - The salsa was good but the bean dip was revolting.

I ordered the shredded beef nachos and my wife had cheese enchiladas.  The best way I can describe the food is "Pedestrian" - sort of like what you would expect at a chain restaurant.  The beef on my nachos was a bit sloppy and my wife described her food as "ok, but nothing id ever crave again".

In a city with so many cheap Mexican options, give Baja Miguel's a big miss. The food is OK, but when you have similarly cheap fare all over town, usually of much higher quality, I don't see any reason to go here again.

On the plus-side, drink service was sensational and the staff looked after us well.One word best describes this place: overpriced.

I had the miso soup, the Seafood Yaki Soba, mint lemonade, and shrimp tempura, and our table split a Lotus on Fire roll.

The Lotus on Fire roll was great.  Spicy and tasty.  Can't complain there.  The mint lemonade was also a nice tasty surprise.

There really wasn't much else beyond that.  The Yaki Soba was bland, and the calamari was overcooked and rubbery.  The shrimp tempura was tasteless, and the sauce that came with it had no flavor. And the miso soup was weak.

One of my colleagues ordered a plate of pickled veggies (I forgot what the dish was called).  It was mostly a pile of boring dill pickles, and a small spattering of other, more interesting vegetables.  What a ripoff.

Our bill?  $25 apiece.  A little ridiculous considering the quality of food.

They seem to have a motif at Tempe Marketplace: it fits right in with its neighbors, Lucille's and Maria Maria, with its artsy-fartsy decor and disappointing, overpriced food.Samba is really expensive, considering how mediocre the service is.  I went for brunch recently and the hostess (an older woman) wouldn't seat us until our entire party had arrived (who were just looking for parking, which we told her).  I don't mind this policy when a restaurant is at capacity, but there were at least a dozen EMPTY tables.  She also wouldn't take our coats until our party had arrived!?!?  
     My partner can put food away, so we've been here several times, but for anyone with a normal appetite you can feel compelled to absolutely GORGE yourself to get your money's worth.Came in tonight around 7:30 with three kids and two adults and we were promptly seated. The waitress was initially prompt and took our order. The ordering process went smoothly with one exception in which the waitress stopped mid-order to verify the price on a side order of biscuits. It seemed strange but she recovered quickly. The first salad came out very quickly and I thought "Wow - great decision for a Hungry group with kids."  The food came out shortly thereafter and I was very satisfied with the fish fry. Normally I would rate the food a solid 3 stars and perhaps bump up the rating to 4 stars with great service, but unfortunately after our food came out, our waitress literally disappeared. We had to practically beg to get our drinks refilled and we went for long periods of time before she checked on us. The restaurant was not overly busy. I requested that the waitress bring a box out for the food which is normally a sign of "hey - we are ready to leave" but it was at least 15 minutes before we saw her again to request the check after bringing us the box. It was really frustrating and because of the experience, I'm not sure I want to go back. The food is good overall, but I can get equally good food and much better service somewhere else.I ate at the branch across from UNLV.  The bagels are nice and chewy, but not too heavy.  They aren't REAL bagels, but they won't make you gag, either.  They offer a lot of nasty goyishe cup flavor bagels, too.  I wouldn't eat those if you paid me.  The prices were kind of high for what you get, and the food is very mainstream-trendy.  It's the kind of place I go when I'm simply hungry and don't want to think about what I would like to eat.

Einstein's is living down (or up) to my expectations--it's consistently "okay", nothing too wild when I decide I want a bagel and a cup of coffee before my first class in the morning.

My most recent visit moved the rating down.  The bulk of the staff was in the back having some kind of "motivational" meeting (the kind with chanting and cheering and all that nonsense).  In the mean time, the lunch rush had just started, the few people still working out front were completely overwhelmed, the soda machine was broken, but not every person working taking orders or cashiering was aware of/dealing with it in any way, and everything was basically a mess.  For inflated prices, mediocre food, long lines and general chaos, I can stay on the UNLV side of Maryland Parkway, and at least not risk being hit in a crosswalk.I am using my Groupon for this place and its not a great start. We were left standing at the  front door for a good 5 minutes. My pet peeve is that they see u standing there but wont say anything!!! WTH Come on people a simple we'll be right you goes a long way. I also checked on Yelp to get free guacamole which was cool but it was kinda bland, no flavor.  I got the carne adovada which came with beans and rice. Only the rice was flavorful. My yobo had the double stack chicken enchiladas (red sauce) with  the fried egg. His was good but the beans got no taste to them.  The most important  question is......Would I come back??? NO thanks I'll passI have been there many times , the food is good, products and the smoothy bar.
I order a a smoothy made of kale, spinach , etc etc . I got sick after taking them for 5 days , i got a stomach infection, the vegetables were not properly clean, the employees of the bar they look always understaffed and most of the time the drinks  are all made wrong, expensive but it is not worth it when it affect your health with the bacteria or micro-animals that come with the produce . they need to be more care full and clean the ingredients before they put them on the juicer!! or they going to kill someone!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!For the past few weeks, I have been told how good this place is. I have been told on a number of occasions that I have to try this place. So, the day after Thanksgiving, I find myself on Monona Drive and I think, why not - time to try it.

I was not impressed. Coffee was from Alterra (?), so what. Just average coffee. I ordered the petit dejeuner. It was just scrambled eggs. I don't eat bacon, and the toast was hard toast. Any easy coast diner can serve this and its 100 times better. It was priced okay at 5.50, but there was nothing that would make me come back. I bought a donut muffin on my way out and it was as equally disappointing.

There was nothing memorable here. I think of La Conversation in Los Angeles, where you order the pumpkin pancakes and you think of nothing else after you leave. The haunting memory drives you to return. Alas, that is not the case here.

Crema Cafe, I have had better.Overrated. 

I think I ordered the wrong steak but at $60 a steak, I still expected a good steak. 

I read the reviews and I still ordered the bone in since bone in has such good flavor. Yes, I understand it wouldn't be the most tender cut of meat, but it was chewy. I have had much better steaks in texas (also corn fed like they highly describe on their menu and by the waiter) than at cut. 

The rest - the sides were ok. i really enjoyed the mac and cheese that gets prepped (stirred) at the table as well as the spinach with egg. But the other sides were just ok. 

Wine/drink: they had a drink menu on an ipad and yes that's impressive but when it's a group of seven (mostly guys - i was the lone girl) it might be smart to give us more than one unit. 

The cheesy bread was amazing - that's the only reason this place got two stars. 

Service was great - but expected at a place of this size. 

All said and done, I paid two hundred dollars for my meal of a bad steak and ok mac and cheese. 

will not come again.Cadillac Ranch seems like the Scottsdale away from Scottsdale. I've been here a few times and the crowd has always seemed stuck up.  I can't comment on the food as I've never tried it... so all I'm commenting on is the bar hoppers and the bar tenders.

The bar staff was nice one time... but I think it was just because I went there when it was slow and they (she) would come talk to me. However, the other time I went I may as well jumped behind the bar and made my drink myself... I'm not even sure they would have noticed. Maybe this isn't a slam to the bartenders themselves as maybe they were understaffed... as it was to the owners. 

I dunno... I just haven't had the best time here.My boyfriend and I decided to have dinner here after seeing the reviews on yelp and based on the fact that it was in walking distance of our hotel. The atmosphere was nice, the service was decent and the sushi wasn't bad, but it wasn't anything spectacular to write home about. I'm aware that everything around the Vegas strip is going to be pretty expensive, but considering the price, I was greatly disappointed, it's definitively not worth the money, we left feeling completely unsatisfied."I don't know how this place have pretty good reviews because the food was not great. I love buffets but this was probably one of the worst I've gone to. Very little selections and the food was like I said before not that great. Well I went and ate during brunch so they had breakfast and lunch food. The eggs were soggy, the meat was nasty but the carb foods were pretty good. The lunch food were pretty plain  and some were bland like the pasta. The meaty lunch entrees were pretty good though. They had a lot of desserts but they weren't that great. I probably like at most like 3 out of maybe 10? 15? but yea. The ice cream was good but you can get that kind of ice cream at any buffet.

but I guess it's pretty cheap?
breakfast is like 10-11
lunch12-13
dinner-??"If nothing goes wrong, this is an okay place to stay. If anything, and I mean anything goes wrong, you will have to call front desk multiple times to get it fixed. Service here is hit or miss and generally not great. Recently, I found a condom on my balcony, no big deal, assholes come to vegas to act like fools and get wasted, I'm sure some prick from some other state thought it would be fun to bang someone and then toss the rubber off the balcony. Kind of an asshole move but whatever, it landed on my balcony, shit happens. So I call the front desk to have someone clean it up, then I go to lunch. Back 2 hrs later and it's still there, so I call again, wait another hour and then call again. Finally they sent someone who was helpful and sympathetic. Still, had to make 3 calls, speak to 7 people and wait 4 hours to get this taken care of, this is merely one example, bullshit like this is an all too common occurrence. Nice looking hotel, given a choice though, I would stay somewhere else. And if you do decide to stay here, please don't throw your rubbers off the balcony.Stopped in to this cheese shop while visiting from out of town. We wanted to do a tasting of various cheeses and figured this would be the place to go. When I asked about doing a tasting the guy acted confused and was very unfriendly. It's a cheese shop so I figured they would have an option where you could pick several cheeses to taste for a price. After giving up on the tasting idea we thought we'd still grab a sandwich since we read that they make sandwiches. All the sandwiches were pre-made and sitting in a cooler. Not too appetizing so we left without purchasing anything...
I still give it two stars because they had a nice assortment of cheeses and the shop was cute. Customer service here is awful. The lady at the counter was rude too. Our time in Madison was short so it wasn't worth us wasting time in a place like this.Located on the Strip in Fashion Show Mall, this massive Forever21 store is actually considered a 'Department Store' on the mall's map.  With two stories, it even has an elevator and its own his/hers restrooms (women's on the first floor and men's on the second floor).  

Customer Service is Horrible: 
Absolutely no 'Hello' or 'Welcome' from ANY employee and I passed about 10 employees during my visit.  Unfortunately, terrible customer service is consistent with most Forever21 stores I've shopped at.  Since customer service is extremely important to me, this knocks off an entire star.  Moreover, of the three register areas that I saw, only one register area was open.  Seriously, why have all those registers and employees but have only 2 registers open IN THE SAME AREA!?  I had to search for an open register by going from one side of the first floor to the other side of the second story.  Of course the employees saw me searching but did not offer to help.  They continued to chit-chat with each other and I am not one to ask rude employees for help.

Restroom:
The restroom was rather unpleasant.  I'm not expecting anything extravagant but let's just say that some gas station restrooms are more well-kept. There was an OPEN trash can, obviously filled with gross trash, right next to the toilet.  The sink handle was also broken. 

Selection:
This location has more products than any Forever21 store I've ever been to.  I noticed a few items displayed in different areas of the store.  I actually like this strategy because the store is so big that I might have missed it the first (or second) time. All items were neatly displayed and organized but I would rather shop online than deal with their terrible customer service.When I go in an Italian restaurant, managed by Italians, I always hope of having a beautiful experience. It just didn't happen here. 

It is a shame when an Italian serves overcooked pasta. 

We ordered an eggplant parmigiana and one margherita pizza. The eggplant was breaded which is nice but was kind of raw, you could see the inside of the eggplant still a little on the green side. 
The pasta that came with the parmigiana was absolutely gross.... way over cooked and the sauce was really thick and dark in color. 

The pizza was just ok... i had better, the crust missed any kind of wood flavor... you know that kind of charred flavor you get from a wood burning oven. the sauce was a bit acidic and the cheese tasted cheap. 

Overall i don't get the hype about pizza a metro. The service was nice but not enough to make me go backi live very closes by dannys so when i need an oil change i usually go there because you get a free wash. well, not anymore. my gf was flying in to PHX and i had about 45 mins to kill until she landed. i decided to get my oil changed. i asked the guys how long, both of them said 20mins, 30 mins at the longest with the wash. i said okay, well 1 hour later, and a gf who had already landed i finally said "listen, i need my car now". they said its almost done, we still need to wash it though. i told them no, just give it to me. they gave me a slip for a future wash, which is fine, but the problem is they tell you 20 mins it should be 20mins, 30 at most. next time, i'll drop it off at the mechanic or go to jiffy lube. 

oh, and i forgot to mention the sales guys. my god. i told the car wash rep i needed an oil change, he asked me about 12 times to upgrade for $3 or $6. literally 12 times, are you kidding me? that is bordering on harassment. its bad enough and i'm a guy, my poor gf is really offended by the constant badgering. then the oil change kid, he asks if i want to upgrade to today's special of synthetic oil for $62.99. wtf? first off, the price is scribbled in pen directly on his clipboard. obviously, it is the that same damn special everyday so just our everyday special. also, how dumb is this kid that he can't remember the prices. 

dannys really needs to get their act together. go back to basics. train these sales people better. its fine if you want to offer me once to upgrade, maybe twice, but that is it. i will give credit to dannys for the design of the lobby and the aesthetics. but all the great goes to crap when you have terrible customer service.This place definitely ain't The San Diego Zoo, but  props for really trying to provide a place for the kids and family to go see the animals.

its not  much, but at least its something...If only the state would assist this non-profit organization with improvements.

I guess Vegas has to make do with this for now...ALOHA!!!We dined here for the first time on Saturday. It was ok. Not great, not awful, ok. The prices were decent, I thought, but they also have coupons on their website so check that out. 

We had the Gyoza to start which had a nice texture and subtle, but good flavors. It was a little oily but, hey, they are fried so it's to be expected. We ordered a bunch of different rolls and some were good, some were ok, some were disappointing.

My favourite was the ladybug and the sriracha/sweet sauce on the plate. I loved that spiciness with the tuna! Yum!! We also had the caterpillar and dragon which were just meh. The spicy salmon was disappointing because it had zero spice to it. We should have asked them to make it more spicy. 

The sushi rice was inconsistent. On some rolls there was way too much, on some it wasn't wrapped tightly enough so it fell apart and on some the texture was way too gummy and gooey. 

I would like to try Sushiya again and try some different rolls, specify spicy and maybe try some other things on their menu because it's awfully close to my house and the prices were decent. Not a bad place, but not really that great, either. Just meh.We arrived at 1155 am for lunch and waited 20 mins despite half the restaurant was empty. Our hostess led us to the table, and there were six of us ,so it took us a few seconds more to settle down. She left w/o waiting for us, and just left the menus on the table. No good. Our bald server from Phoenix came, never introduced himself, I thought he was the busboy since he poured water and left w/o a word. We saw all the tall glass milkshakes on almost every table while waiting , so all of us ordered them. Hubby loves lamb, so he had the lamb tandoori burger. I don't want just another burger, so I had the Kobe beef burger. Friends ordered the BLT, 2 Classic, Texas. we ordered sweet potato fries. For shakes, we had vanilla, chocolate, black and white, a marshmallow flavor(forgot name), mudslide, strawberry. It took a good half hour for the food to arrive. I think hubby's lamb is the best. Very juicy, flavorful, had the lamb taste but not overpowering. Even his hamburger buns are different than ours. My Kobe was ok, not as good as Burger Bar, but after I took a bite of the other burgers, I was so glad I had my Kobe. Theirs were horrible, dry, hard, not even close to the ones at Carl's Jr. And all our burgers were very small! Mine was just a bit bigger than the Happy Meal hamburger, the rest are a little bigger than mine. The shakes, please order the marshmallow one, that was the only one worth $8 for. The other flavor, save yourself some $ and go to McD. The  burgers are about $9-13, Kobe $18, shakes $7-8. Fries $4.  I definitely expected a lot more for a $9+ burger.Well not at all what I was expecting from a Michelin 3 star restaurant.  At $655 a person, I was very disappointed.  I will not return again.Yelp's rating system couldn't put it any better.

2 stars for "Meh. I've experienced better."

When I go to Vegas, I expect crazy, wild, extraordinary, and amazing. I expect something beautiful, exotic, and luxurious, especially due to the amount of money that these places are making on a daily basis. If you're looking for something that's kind of ... homey, this is the place to go. Other than the two stripper poles in the center of the dance floor, I really don't see anything spectacular about this place. It's basically a large smoke-filled box. And no, not just fog machine smoke, we're talking cigarette smoke so thick that you're in a cloud of it.

On my first trip to Jet, there was some celebrity whose name I forget, but come on, it's Jet, and you can't really see anybody in the darkness. There's flashing lights up front, but you'll be blinded if you try looking at them. I didn't think I'd ever go back, but on my most recent trip, I stayed at Mirage and with our hotel key we got in for free before midnight. Considering we had about a billion guys and depending on the night, 1-2 girls, free club entry sounded REALLY GOOD. It's just disappointing that it was at Jet.

Plus two stars for nice security, even though the lines move super slow. Also plus for the "open bar" which consists of SKYY/juice cocktail until midnight for girls. Coat check is $5 and the lady working it was super kind, as was the security guard working the exit during the three nights in a row that I went. (yeah, THREE NIGHTS. I didn't stay that long on any particular night, somehow we always ended up back here though)

Oh and before I forget, super negative stars for big girls that get up on the stripper poles and shove their junk in everyone's faces when they swing around the pole. I almost got hit multiple times, and got a drink spilled on me from above. So if you get up there, or your drunk friend does, please PLEASE be considerate of others. & please pull your friend down if you think she's going to fall off the stage, it'll save her the embarrassment later, and it'll save some pain for the innnocent bystanders that she lands on.This place is known for being the best steakhouse in KW, so I was really looking forward to a belated Valentines Day dinner. I can't tell you how disappointed I was!  I was anticipating melt-in-your-mouth prime rib but it was tough, tasteless and chewy.  And the garlic mashed potatoes that came with it were neither garlicky nor fresh...they were congealed and gritty like yesterday's leftovers.  I didn't even touch them.  My hubby's strip loin was way overcooked, beyond well-done.  I was dumbfounded at how bad the meal was.  Our waiter claimed that it had been a very busy night and the kitchen was trying to catch up.  (Our food did take  a long time to arrive, which was ok because we were having a nice leisurely meal.)  He gave us the option of having another steak cooked or taking the cost of the meal off the bill.   We opted for the latter because by that point we were so disappointed we just wanted to leave.  On a positive note, the service was impeccable; hence, the 2 star rating instead of 1.  A terrible shame about the food though...we will go to The Keg next time I've got a hankering for prime rib or steak.Total sux ass! What a disappointment. 

We found out that a new Indian place openning up near by and wanted to go check it out. Came once and they were closed. Came again and they were closed. But finally today we found place open. Ordered some stuff, got some boxes took them home (Its really not an eat in kinda place unless you like dinky tables and Walmart plastic chairs.) 
Ohh boy! Ohh boy! Ohh wait! Rice? WTF! Its just a bowl of rice with some very little "Stuff" on top of it. WOW Are those vegetables from frozen pack, cuz it sure looks like it. Tastes like it too. 
So, i just paid 15 bux for 2 small bowls of rice with some questionable chicken and some frozen veggies that tasted like fast food Indian. 

Damn i feel violated.I can't stand this Walmart Supercenter.  It's dirty and crowded.  However, it was the closest location to me at the time and they do have what you need and generally its at a low fair price.

It's your typical Walmart but I prefer the one in Glendale on 59th Ave & BellChicken was ok the the person at the counter not very friendly

.Now that I have come clean to the Yelp community about my occasional dabbles with chains I feel it is best to cut right to the quintessential original chain.

I myself very seldom get anything from McDonald's but I have kids that enjoy their french fries and the wraps they affectionately call "Crap Snacks"

Additionally my wife is not a coffee drinker and her preferred caffeine delivery method is diet coke.  So the fast food joints not infrequently get the business for the diet cokes.

The reason this particular McDonald's bears yelping is that it holds a singular record, one that I am at this point hoping it will maintain.  Once a record is set I sometimes loathe to see it fall.

You see, this particular McDonald's has been visited by myself or members of my immediate family not less than 12 times.  On not one of those occasions have they produced a mistake free order.  Not once.  It's really rather remarkable.  It's not like we routinely order dramatic variations such as "No ketchup" or the dreaded "Can you put Big Mac onions on that?"

Yet they have steadfastly achieved at least one mistake on each and every order, without exception.  

On the occasions when we visit this McDonald's we now wait with baited breath while someone checks the bag and confirms that yes, indeed there is something we did not order in the bag or we are missing something we did order or something we ordered is not right.  Please, in the name of all that is Mass Consumerism in America, do not get this order correct!  We have standards!  There are bigger issues at play here!The teas are amazing! However, I truly dislike the high pressure service/sales!!! I can read the sale signs, and if I need help or want to try a specific tea I will ask. I appreciate the friendly and welcoming feel and asking if I need help, but the pressuring to buy more than what I came in for makes me almost not want to walk into one of their stores and buy everything online!!! So, love the product , but the sales are a bit over the top!Egh...maybe double egh...my GF suggested this place and she arrived a good twenty minutes before I did and was better prepared to place an order. I'm guessing that's why her meal was better than mine although not by much. Enough chit chat let me get to it.

My GF was upset I was 20 minutes late. So I didn't spend too long studying the menu. I saw seafood combo and ordered that without reading everything was battered and fried. In fact there was more batter on my seafood than seafood itself. So disappointing... As I was sitting there being read the riot act for being late I saw a second menu board with more options to choose from. 

When you walk in look right as it appears the good food/typical Asian fare is listed over there and you want to make a fully educated choice.

The girlfriend ordered a BBQ chicken dish. It had good flavor and portion size. She was kind enough to share a bite or two with me when she realized mine was all batter/ breading. 

They have seating for about 15 or 20 people but I think they really don't want you to stay. We ordered at the counter, said we were going to stay and had a seat. Our meals came out in ten minutes served to us in Styrofoam take out containers with plastic forks? No plates or silverware...definitely not a good first impression that was followed up by an equally poor 2nd impression when my seafood combo came out with 75% bread.

I wasn't expecting the Ritz going into a restaurant located in a strip mall but was still sorely disappointed with their food, their service, and overall ambiance. 

The GF said their was no way we'd be back and I'd have to agree.For someone who prefers Hilton over other chains, this place was not up to snuff. On the plus side, really liked the location, very convenient to everything. 

On the minus, shame on me for not checking on whether it has a workout room. It does not. Was told they have an arrangement with a sister Hilton hotel nearby, but it's workout room was undergoing renovation. No suggests for nearby places to work out. Had I noticed this when booking would not have booked.  

Overall, the place is ready for a redo. Carpets, etc are worn. The window in my room was jammed open. I failed to mention it to the staff so they had no opportunity to make right. Third floor room shower water pressure was minimal.I read about this restaurant and was so excited to try it, but think it has past its heyday.

First off, I am 29 year old from London. Just saying cause I hate when Yelp reviews are always older folks who can't take a night on the town.  

The food here was okay and quite a bit pricey, but I have no problem with that. Think Scottish food with a little British touch on top. Not an experience in modern gastronomy, or even farm to table in my opinion, but it was edible. 

The service on the other hand is why I have to give such a poor review. I saw a couple's night get ruined by this woman who worked there named Charlotte. Some Americans were sitting at the bar and being polite; she belittled and insulted them and treated them like crap. I was astonished. Later I asked her for some water when our waiter was busy and she snarled at me! Then, it happened again with this other woman. I tried to shield my clients from interacting with her!

Here is my advice. You'll pay a little more, the food will be okay, it might not feel you are in edinburgh, but be careful. It is kind of a you work for them as the patron place. 

Good luck.A name like Semi-Chem kind of says it all.

Not quite good enough to be a chemist, not quite well stocked enough to be anyting else. The staff arent the greatest, or friendliest I have ever met. 

There is a large range of cheap toiletarries and various other medicines and fungal foot potions that the patrons of this shop might need while they wait what seems like a life time to get thier actual medicine.

I think you are better off going to boots or just putting up with whatever you needed the medicine for in the first place.The place is alright, but you really can't trust how good some of the electrical goods are here. Like Gibson, I purchased a TV here as well, a big early 1990s one and that TV didn't work either. We had to get a taxi to our flat from Cash Converters and then had to take another taxi back with it so that we could return it and get our money back. What I would suggest is that if you do get a TV in there, make sure that you see it actually working before you go ahead and buy it!
If you are going to come here, the safest bet is the DVDs, games and CDs. I bought a few DVDs here and when I tried to play one of them, it just wasn't working, and after a thorough clean of it, it eventually did play. But it does seem to suggest that the staff here do not check if the items work before they put them on sale.I had Jenni's Special Pho and spring roll. spring roll was just ok but pho wasn't that good. because soup was a little plain and not salty enough. their service wasn't good because there is only one waiter serving like 6 tables so I had to wait the check for a long time. eventually nobody helped me to pay my bill so I had to go front and pay bill there. also they don't take credit card so I had to go ATM machine and withdraw cash with fee.I'm so far not impressed.  I mean, sure the ceilings are high but that's kind of where the positives end.

First of all, it's quite small.  For a library servicing such a large area, I would have expected a *much* larger space.  Most importantly though, not all of the book cases are labelled so I wandered around trying to find a specific genre of books and eventually had to ask a member of staff.  Beyond this, the staff member who helped me was unable to read the system well enough to see that the book I was looking for had been reserved (I found this out when I looked for myself) and spent a good 15 minutes wandering around trying to find it.  Sure, it was nice that she looked but as a staff member surely she should know how to read the system?

So, I left underwhelmed.  I know people don't use the library as much as they used to but maybe they would use it more if it didn't have such a tired and uncared-for feeling to it?Rip  off warning! This place has sure changed and not for better.  Warning that the happy hour appetizer while $5 vs $8 or so it is also about half the portion   total rip off!  Since when are happy hour appetizers smaller????For the second go around (I had to go back to meet up with some people who chose this location before I could object), I gave Daily Dose a clean slate.  I went in expecting nothing and that's about what I was given...again.

Believe it or not, the staff was rolling silverware again in the same area as my first visit. Unbelievable.  At least this time there was a seat available outside...far away from the clanking.

The service:
Since I am a server, I don't bash other servers' "styles", but let's just say, our service was weird, not bad, just weird. Lingering stares, awkward silences, you get the picture.  Also, I have been serving for a long time and I still write stuff down.  No, I don't think you're cool if you can remember everything a table orders.  Just guarantee my food gets there the way I ordered it.  This particular time my salad came out loaded with raw onions, which I very clearly asked to be omitted. (I'll let you guess if she was writing it down).

The food:
I am ironically thankful for the fact that the onions were left on my salad.  Because if they weren't there, I would have had a plate of flavorless lettuce and feta cheese.  Come on people.  I tried a difficult breakfast dish the first time I went, so I figured I'd order a common Mediterranean salad, just to give them a "sure thing" attempt.  Wrong. Yuck. Was there even dressing on that?

I'm gonna stop here before I continue beating a dead horse.First of all, I have to preface this by explaining that I am a Philly girl - at least until I moved to Madison at age 25. One of my biggest regrets about living in the Midwest is the lack of real cheesesteaks. Although my personal preference is Jim's on South, as a kid I spent most of my money at Pat's. 

So I was thrilled to read the reviews about this place, including the ones from other Philly transplants, and bundled up the kids and my guy on a Saturday to get a real, juicy, greasy, cheesy joyous mess of a sandwich.

All I can say is that I must have gone on an off day. A really, really, off day. First of all, we were the only people there the whole time (Saturday around 1:00PM), which might mean that they turn down the grill and therefore don't have it at a good temp for cooking. If so, it really is a mistake, as you will see below. 

So we order, we sit, we wait just a few minutes, and then we are brought our steaks. I hate to say it but they were awful. Someone else suggested that the meat cuts vary widely, and I hope to god that's true. Because our meat was so tough that none of us could bite through some of our pieces of meat without a struggle. It was cut too thick, and secondly, it was so tough I actually wondered what cut of beef it was. It certainly wasn't the ribeye that Pat's uses. It was full of tendon and gristle. 

The onions were barely cooked (as it not even translucent) which may be a result of the grill not being hot enough. There was none of that glorious juice that should have been oozing from the meat. And as the final straw, the cheese under the meat was not at all melted, and the rolls were cold. COLD. 

It was a terrible experience. Even my 12 year old son wouldn't finish his. 

I am praying that it was simply an off day, combined with the worst meat they have ever used, and an attempt to save energy by turning down the grill, that culminated in a terrible cheesesteak. I am willing to go back in the hope that it was a complete aberration. But sadly, my guy and kids are not willing to try again - it was that bad. I will have to go it alone. In the meantime, if I really need a guaranteed great steak, I will head to the Philly Way in Milwaukee.I don't think anyone in my family ever had smooth sailing at this place. We have fallen victim to billing issues, rude service, sour stomachs, rice so old it was crunchy, tough steak, hamburger that was cooked on a filthy grill ( the back has all kinds of black charred junk from the grill)....
 That being said perhaps it was just bad luck.. but I personally don't care for much at Southpoint restaurants in general. I think this place is ok for convenience and I'd imagine they can't mess up eggs so breakfast is probably ok but do not go here thinking you are going to engage in fine dining or even yummy diner kind of dining.
 Not recommended really, in my opinion just go to the coffee shop and eat a bakery item to hold you over til dinner. :PThis is for Deb:
I drove to the box that talks back.  I ordered a Quarter Pounder with cheese meal.  With a Diet Coke.  Yeah, I drink Diet.  Not because I think it will even out the bad of the meal, simply because that's what I drink.
I got my food quickly.  I barely remember eating it and gave the last few bites of my burger to the dog, along with a few fries.  The fries were good.
The ice in my cup was really, really cold.I have never waited so long for a plate of rice and a bowl of pho in my life. Short waiters/waitresses and short staff in the kitchen. I think it was about forty five minutes or maybe over until we got our food. It really shouldn't take that long for the order to be brought out and ready to eat. The pho was actually good. It's one of my favorite pho joints in AZ. However the rice plates are bleh. The kbbq chop was real hard along with a microwaved egg? Which is usually suppose to be served sunny up. I would have rated higher but the service extremely sucks here.I tried this place when I went to Las Vegas this summer. Me and my sister were craving for Chinese food so we found this place through online search. The expensive price didn't suprise me, but the food was really disgusting. We tried the hand stretched noodle and the noodle soup was cold and tasteless.  2 stars for the service.Well it's on the strip and near by mass transit and connections to the highway. The room was nothing special, standard cheap hotel beds, decor, and towels but nothing offensive either. Rates are a bargain though since this is an older hotel/casino and it is at the far end of the strip. 

If you are coming to Vegas to enjoy the other sites and sounds, then this might be the hotel for you if you want to save a buck or two for something else. If you are expecting to lounge in the lap of luxury in your resting hours and enjoy some fantastic room service, head towards the center of the strip and some of the newer, better staffed, more opulent casinos. 

I will say though that they have a decent free trapeze show fairly regularly. I'd like to give this place 2 and a half stars but I don't think it merits a third.The name is deceiving, not anything at all like NY style pizza, not even close! Was hoping to get pizza like back home and was disappointed to say the least. The wings were good. The pizza was very doughy, not thin, dough was definitely not handmade. It tasted pre-made. It was very salty, not enough cheese, too much spice in sauce, and even more dry seasonings sprinkled on top, which is totally not necessary. If you're not used to East Coast style pizza then this place would probably be acceptable. Won't eat there again.Soooooooo ... I generally like TGIFridays.  I proposed to my second wife in one.  This particular location, however, is apparently suffering from a total lack of management (at least on the night we visited).  Tuesday afternoon, 4:00-4:30, light crowd (25% or less full).

The appetizer (chip nachos) was awesome.  Then the burgers came out.  For some reason, all three of us ordered burgers.  That hardly ever happens.  When the food arrived (we had each ordered what was SUPPOSED to be a different burger), the burgers were obviously bit right.  The server could not distinguish one from the other.  After consulting the kitchen, plates were exchanged and everything pronounced okay.  We knew they were still not right, but we were hungry and had a movie to go to. 

We told our server that the plates were wrong, but that everything still tasted good.  He told us he would talk to his manager.  He came back and said the manager would like to offer us a free dessert.  We passed. 

Problems: they kept the itemized receipt (with the survey information on it) when they brought the check back after running my card.  Don't want any reviews?  The burgers tasted okay, but were indistinguishable.  They just looked kind buns with greasy piles of cheese-covered ingredients.  The best we could tell, all three had the wrong toppings on them.  No pride in product appearance whatsoever.  So ... the manager was not ensuring quality food was being served, not making sure staff know how to get orders delivered correctly or identify menu items, and addressing customer concerns is not a priority - what EXACTLY is she or he doing back there?  Candy Crush Saga?  eBay?  Quoting lines from "Waiting?"  Whatever it was, it was a management FAIL. 

I will not return until I see some positive Yelp! reviews.Pros:

The best bartender in Phoenix, Jonie, is now at the Turf.
It's not nearly as dirty as Seamus.
The patio is nice.

Cons:

What's with the feeling that it is a music venue. The most empty space ever. 
In no way do I feel like I'm in an irish pub. It would be better fitted in say, DC Ranch where old douches could hang out and feel "Irish" before they go home and bbq in the back yard while listening to Jimmy Buffett.
There is no soul, feeling, or unique aspect of this place whatsoever.I've been here for breakfast a few times. I have no idea why this place is so busy. It's way overpriced on every single meal and not any better than any other breakfast place. I find the food boring and small. The standard price here is $9.00 or higher. There may be 3 items cheaper than that and they're all small. Their "cheap" breakfast is $4 for 1 egg and hash browns. I find that unacceptable. I go to far too many places and I've never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast, especially for $4.00. You can go to Country Boys at 35 ave & Cactus for their standard $3 special with 2 eggs, hash browns, toast, and meat and you get multiple breakfast options for $3.00 at Country Boys. The cheapest other  breakfast on this menu is $6.75-$7.50 for french toast and meat. Otherwise, you're paying $9+ for everything else. I've had the corned beef omelette, twice, boring, flavorless. Today I had 2 very small eggs, small portion of hash browns, and biscuits & gravy. The biscuits were large and homemade. Gravy flavorless. 

I just wouldn't recommend this restaurant. Pricey. No flavor. Small portions. I'm only giving it 2 stars because they do serve giant pancakes. Get their pancake breakfast and split it between 2 people. I feel my self aggravated after paying so much for a meal when I'm leaving still hungry. 

Go to Country Boys. If you don't get their $3 breakfast deals, you can print off buy 1 get 1 free coupons off their website. Anything you order on the regular menu is buy 1 get 1 free. If you've got 10 people in your group, you can use 5 coupons and get 5 breakfasts free.

My favorite breakfast place, Ollies Omelette House. 51 Ave & Olive. Quality. Fair pricing. Great food.1.5 Stars! 

Good
Nice bed and pillows.  
View was nice---facing Bellagio
Room was clean on day 1
Customer service...mixed... so/so at best.
Non smoking or gambling hotel.

Bad
1st... we were there to enjoy Las Vegas... and we did...so... not really hung up on the room but there were issues. 

Left room on day 2 @ 0700 requested the room be cleaned... back to the room at 1530 and no maid service... not cool. 
Broken phone
Fridge didn't cool
Shower pressure was almost like pouring out a bottle of water.. if that much pressure. Really low... made getting a shower a PITA! 
Overpowering potpourri smell in the entire hotel.
Iron was chained to the ironing board... 1st time I had seen this...even in low budget hotels I've never seen it.  Maybe there is an iron thief in the building? 
Noise from the room above... 
Electrical outlets did not work (3x)



Conclusion.... 
We will not stay at the Vdara  again...  it's touted as a upscale hotel but it's smoke and mirrors... it's a 3 star place.
 
If you are looking to stay at in a nice suite... smoke free and casino free...  spend the same money and go to the MGM Signature.  Much nicer suites, great staff... just a nicer place to stay.Stayed at Vdara in early December 2011. Stayed here because of the location and the price they gave me. The trip from the airport was a troublesome. they had the marathon running the night I arrived. So, the shuttle driver tells me and this couple, which they were staying at Cosmo, that he was dropping us off at Planet Hollywood Towers and we would have to walk from there. So after the, I figured a good mile hike across the pedestrian bridge, Crystals and Aria, I arrive at Vdara tired as hell. Most complain about having to wide their way through the ropes at check in. I would have done this with no problems. No organization what so ever at Vdara. 2 people at the check in desk. People are just walking up and cutting in front of me and others who are waiting for the desk clerk to wave us over. Thought since I was nice and patient, I thought the clerk would at least offer an upgrade, which I would have taken, but no. She offers it to the man next to me who doesn't speak any English. So after getting my keys, I head straight upstairs and realize what view I was getting from the curve in the hallway. Got me a nice glimpse of the backside of Aria all the way down to Mandalay Bay and THE Hotel. Unpack, plug my phone in, and jump in the shower so I can go to dinner next door at Cosmo. Water pressure? What water pressure? Flamingo has better water pressure than these guys. I know its eco-friendly, but come on. Small cramped bathroom, especially the toilet. Shallow sink, so be careful when turning the water on or you will splash everywhere. Housekeeping never replenished my toiletries in the 3 nights I was there. I know it was a short stay, but I would like enough soap and shampoo to make it through the visit. The bed was very comfortable. TV worked just fine. Security checks every night at the elevators which is very nice. The best part of the hotel? The hotel bar, Bar Vdara. And the drink of choice was the Black Dragon. The bartender told me he has seen people just sit there all night and down those drinks. It was very delicious and I could see how you could just sit back and down those all day and night. Will not be staying at Vdara unless someone else is paying for it haha.we were given 4 coupons upon check in 
& thats the only reason why we came.
about an hour passed & the slut cocktail waitress didnt look our way.
im not exaggerating.
why did we let an hour pass w./o saying anything?
well we were at our cousins wedding after party & we did leave to gamble & then returned so there went those 60 mins.
so my bf said "the hell w/the free drinks" & went to the bar to get ours.
the inside of this lounge is cheesy.
dark.
smoky.
stinky.
i totally have a feeling a lot of sex stuff has taken place on the sofas.
we eventually used our coupons.
i bet my chardonnay was a gallon of gallo.It's 8 pm at night and I'm craving for some wonton soup. Without a whole lot of thinking, I put in a delivery order from Mr. Beijing for a wonton soup, chicken lettuce wrap and a ma po tofu. I'm sad to say I really hated all three items that I ordered. The wonton soup had a cloudy broth that was way too salty while the ma po tofu was drowned in this semi thick sauce full of overcooked peas. The only thing I felt edible was the chicken lettuce wrap. I will not order from here again.This was my first time going to the Rhythm Kitchen.  We ordered the Broiled Oysters, Etouffe with Crawfish, Cobb salad, Gumbo, and Strawbery Shortcake for dessert.  The waiter was very slow in bringing out our food, however, he was very knowledgeable about all of the menu items.  I must say that we were extremely dissappointed with the Broiled Oysters.  It was $11 for 6 oysters.  Ok, no problem.  But the oysters were really small (almost as of they cut an oyster into 4 pieces and placed 1 piece into the shell when serving).  It was covered in sauce so you couldn't really tell much other than it was really, really small.  The sauce was so so, and the oysters didn't taste fresh.  I am use to having my oysters at the 777 Brewery at the Main Street Station Casino (the absolute freshest oysters ever) and very reasonably priced!  The Etouffe with Crawfish was awesome though and we really enjoyed that.  The Cobb salad was good as well, although the bacon used on the salad was not freshly fried bacon, but rather, it tasted like the bottled stuff you buy.  If I'm paying $7 for a tiny side salad everything had better be freshly prepared, period.  The Gumbo was average, I've had better, but acceptable.  The biggest disappointment, however, was the Strawberry Shortcake!  The picture on the menu looked fabulous and I am a huge Strawberry Shortcake fan.  Guess what came to the table?  Two slices of storebought pound cake, covered with whipped cream (the whipped cream was freshly made, at least they did that) and drizzled on top was frozen strawberries in sauce (looked like the stuff I buy at Smart n Final).  I was expecting fresh strawberries and maybe some homemade poundcake!  What was I thinking?I  have to write that I was disappointed.  The problem may have been the waiter but our appetizers didn't come until 10 minutes later when we had to remind him that it hadn't arrived (he forgot).  He forgot the Channa Masala and we were too far into our meal to ask for it again.  He didn't ask us how hot we wanted our food so it all came out bland without much spice.

If you look at my ratings for Indian cuisine, I pretty much love all of it.  By far the best I have found in the Phoenix area is the Dhaba in Tempe.  Here the food was fine but given the alternatives, I wouldn't go back.  The veggies were too mashed together and the Chicken tikka masala sauce was too thick and goopy.  The lamb biryani was good but since they made it so mild, I didn't enjoy it as much as I could have.

The atmosphere is cute and more upscale than most Indian restaurants and the mall area is attractive and upscale as well.I just don't know. I liked the valet service. I don't like not knowing where to stand and wait for the hostess to seat you because you come through a back patio door and assume it's not the front. There aren't many tables inside, and they are all close together because the huge bar table takes up a ton of room. The patio outside did look cute though. 

Always wanted to try the bruschetta here so I got the prosciutto fig & honey, the classic mozzarella basil tomato, a salmon caper something, and my waiter suggested the roasted red pepper as my fourth choice. 

You get a ton of food, each slice is cut up into four pieces and quantity wise it is worth the price. But taste and flavor, not so much. The fig and prosciutto was different and almost desert like with the sweetness, but the rest of the three were lackluster. The salmon and caper was blanddddd like barely any salmon flavor at all. The red pepper was the opposite, way too much flavor. Roasted red pepper is a huge taste bud explosion but you have to balance that, the chef did not know how to do this as it was a huge pile of pepper and you could barely taste anything else. Last sadly was the "classic" mozzarella tomato basil. So sad. I guess I am spoiled by my Mother's perfect fresh basil and tomatoes with her balsamic glaze back home. They had no balsamic on the dish and I had to request a bottle, it still didn't add up. 

Service was great though. Maybe I would come back and try some of the other flavors. Hopefully those are worth the price because my choices didn't seem like it!Well, 
What can you say if a casino's "Fine Dining", cannot deliver better food than it's buffet. Pretty sad. Best view in Vegas , no way ! That title hands down goes to the Stratosphere. Nice view of the valley, sure. 
The sushi was poor at best. The Kobe slider tasted like a mini burger at jack in the box . I had to saw through my rack of lamb, which had no flavor and was Tough as hell. 
I have been going to the M since it opened, and wanted to give this place time to iron out the kinks, what a disappointment. 
If I owned the M , I would find out who runs the buffet, transfer him and a few chefs upstairs , send the cook that is there now, downstairs where he can deep fry shrimp, happily ever after.If you've been to the one in NY, you have to check out the one in Vegas right? I walked up to the order window outside, just wanted a chocolate milkshake, they told me I had to go inside and order at the bar. I kid you not, 4 guys at the bar, yes, busy, but not one bothered to acknowledge anyone who wanted to order that they will be right with you. I looked at the menu to see what kind of shakes they had. They had a $9.50 Milkshake. I thought, hey, if I'm going to get a drink, I should get one with alcohol. So, I ordered my Cosmo $16.70!! That was insane. Everyone was pissed, walking out, more people were coming in, I gave them a heads up that the service sucks and that you'll be waiting a long time. I had plenty of time to talk to those who were waiting and  warned them, since I wasn't going to leave until I finished the last drop of my drink!Perfecto seems to be the place that I always end up at when I'm in Vegas. The first time I came here was for Pimp and Ho at Rain, then Above & Beyond (AMAZING), BT (eh it was ok but we had the Sky Box so who cares), and then now for DJ Qbert the most recent time.

I must say the times previously were so much better than the last. I guess it was hard to top due to the previous times and we just went since it was hooked up, but it kind of ruined my experience at Perfecto. Thankfully I was with my loved ones so regardless I had a good time.

Whomever opened for DJ Qbert was better than Qbert. The music got progressively worse which is when I left and hopped over to Moon. I'm not sure if it was because the music was bad, I wasn't drunk enough, we didn't have a table or the Sky Box, but it just was not good. NOT GOOD. 

For those thinking of checking out Perfecto, definitely check who is playing beforehand and get a table or box.I grew up on Popeyes - back in high school after tennis practice i would get a 5 piece dark for $2.99.  My first job at 16 was at a grocery store bagging groceries but I desperately wanted to work at Popeyes.  Every time I move, i dont tell anyone but Popeyes has a role in my moving process - I need to be within striking I mean driving distance to my spicy chicken.

So this is currently the closest Popeyes to my house and it is the worse Popeyes I have ever had.  I've been here about 30+ times and probably 1/3 of the time they bait and switch me.  EVERY SINGLE TIME.   i ask for spicy and they give me the mild.  And it's not fresh out of the fryer mild.  It's the mild that no one orders - that gets dried up over time.  I should report their store manager.  I think he/she tells his staff to purposefully serve the mild chicken especially if you go through the drive through.....And why do they even offer mild here?  The mild is the worse fast food chicken...it's even worse than KFC.

Anyhow despite the fact I am let down 1/3 of the time i always come back.  Popeyes is part of my life and always will be.   There's Raising Canes - far superior but I have life long memories of Popeyes.  Maybe i'll now be forced to drive a few miles further to 215/Rainbow but till then i'll return here and cross my fingers I get my spicy chicken.On paper everything looked great: grass fed naturally raised beef and good ingredients. Unfortunately they didn't execute on a good plan.

I ordered the American Kobe beef burger medium-well with fries. I'm not sure I received the Kobe that I ordered because two thirds in it became apparent that it was well done. It was nearly burnt to a crisp and not just around the edges as I had thought. The fries were passable but mostly forgettable.

The service was okay at best. After we ordered we were passed off to two second stringers that were entirely uncoordinated. We were asked at least three times if we needed a box for leftovers, which each time we answered yes.

The interior has a lot of flat surfaces so it gets really loud in there. This is not a good place for groups larger than four people. Any bigger than that and people at the end of the table are essentially lost, unless you like yelling at each other but that only makes the problem worse.Used to be one of my favorite spots in the valley.  Great food and warm and efficient service.  The past 3 times, I have visited the service was a joke.  Pico Rico burger and fish tacos still get two snaps, but don't think of going back to often any longer.  I wonder what changed here?Fun if you're a drag queen with disposable income. But for a guy who's just buying heels for fun , not the best. I love their catalogues and wide selection , but the prices are off the charts. I'm not a drag queen , and I don't think I'll be back anytime soon.I really use to love this place. I like to go dancing and ever since they took away the bar around the dance floor, there is no place to put your drink, lean and the dance floor is virtually nonexistent when it gets crowded. The last 3 times I've been there they served me beer in a 32oz cup not a mason jar wtf? Still this place is good to come see concerts Hopefully the one opening up in Peoria will be better.Good thing this place has a lot of good reviews or I would never go back.  Since I worked in the Biz  and I am a forgiving person when I think a place may have had an off night. I promise to try it again and repost another review.(  But don't let me down when I go back! Ok Parlor? ) 

The food was not good at all. In fact it should never have left the kitchen. Long story but the chef  was very negligent with our meal and should have never served the food he or she did. My very upset friend won't return. I had the pizza which was bland and flavorless. The crust was good but I am at a loss why people think this is the best pizza in town. It wasn't bad per say, just not great.I am coming to the realization that no pizza here will ever live up to a true NY pizza slice. I am just picky in that regards and am finding I am not a lover of the real Italian/woodfire/whatever way of making pizza nowadays, despite the authenticity. I just long for a slice of Pizza that reminds me of my roots. 

The only thing that saved the day here is the service, which was outstanding!  They did everything right. Even the waiter seemed displeased with the chef's error. The manager and server were  great and i notice those things. The restaurant is also very pretty and we had no wait time when we went. ( So go before 6ish on a Saturday. It got packed shortly after) 

On a key note the french pressed coffee and Tiramusu are great here! They have these Hazelnut chip pieces on top that were scrumptious!  This might be a new, great dessert place for me, if the food doesn't please me on the next visit. 

Ok Parlor, until  next time!--------------Breakfast, lunch, and late night------------------
For a place that's super spacious, the service is ridiculously slow and the food is subpar (pretty on par with all standard priced places in Vegas). I was working an event in this hotel which required me to make sure my team was fed during the long hours. This place doesn't do to-go. You wait in line, all so you can be seated, order your food and get it to go. I realize its not meant to be a fast food place but seriously? An HOUR just to get y food to go? Bleh.Beutifull modern decor  with ok food . However they are always understaffed and very slow to serve you, the management are not very helpful and will not do anything to meet or attend any of your needs.  If it is the last place to get a bite to eat., this the place.   In summary an expensive cafeteria !All the meat was poor quality and overcooked. The dim sum was OK, great cured meats and cheeses. The shellfish was awful and the crab legs with ghee was my favorite part. The dessert selection is great but many poorly executed dishes. I only went because of proximity,  would not go back, and think it was very overpriced for the quality.My wife and I will not go back to this unit.  So inconsistent....service, food, etc.....  The unit in Mesa is much more consistent.  4 more miles to drive but I am tired of being disappointed.I stopped by last week for the free Tangy Jumbo Shrimp with an internet coupon.  The restaurant was located in the Meadows Mall in Las Vegas.  I got 3 shrimp with the tails on mixed with red bell peppers and green beans.  I would not pay for the Tangy Jumbo Shrimp.Okay, they say what happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas. Well, for this Denny's, I think it is true. Right, right, right, knowing what a Denny's is going in, you better have lower expectations. As stated brilliantly by Scott D., Denny's is the McDonalds of sit-down dinning.

With all the excellent food options in Vegas, if it wasn't for a free breakfast voucher due to staying at the attached Days Inn, I wouldn't have eaten here. This Denny's is actually located inside the Wild Wild West casino. The casino is actually really a very small and very smoked-filled gambling hall complete with stained carpets and depressed gamblers. Yea, it is enough to lower your happiness points by at least a factor of ten.

Anyways, back to the Denny's. We sat down at 11am on a Sunday morning, with checkout being at noon. It appears that everyone else was trying to cash in their vouchers before hitting The Strip. This place was PACKED to the gills. There were three parties of nine waiting at the front desk, plus our party of two. Every table was taken.

After a short wait, they did open a booth for us. We were served coffee quickly and the waitress did take our order promptly, but was completely lacking in the smiles or friendliness department. She just jotted down what we wanted and ran off without so much as moving a facial muscle. Yea, we're getting a free breakfast, but wouldn't you like to earn a tip?

Anyways, the eggs were cooked well, the hash browns were unspectacular and the bacon was nothing but fat and grizzle. At least the coffee was strong. Despite the place being packed, they did serve us surprisingly quickly.

A few notes:

- Smoke from the casino billows into the dinning area, ask to be seated near the rear if you want semi-fresh air
- Don't expect any customer service or smiles, down to a man (and woman) every single one of the employees looked stressed and annoyed to be there, including the manager
- The food is standard Denny's fare, which is consistently blah, thank God for Tabasco sauce
- Eat here only if you are trying to cash in your Day's Inn voucher, there are so many better restaurants and buffets on The Strip
- They do not allow free breakfasts for the Days Inn vouchers to be taken out of the dinning room, you must sit-in only to redeem them, meh

Bottom line, go somewhere else if you aren't going for the free meal!The new Fry's in the burbs are awesome, but this old relic is pretty bad. Ugly with a with a smaller selection, plus staff who pass you in the aisles (when you're obviously looking for something) without asking if they can help. If you're in this neighborhood, head over to the nearby Safeway.I have been a loyal safeway cstomer for 23 years. Since moving to a diiferent part of the valley, I have not been as impressed with the new location. Primarily it is an evening crew that is apethetic. Last mothers day eve, my husband and I were shopping later into the night. By the time we got our almost 2 carts loaded, it was almost close. So they had ALL the full service registers closed! we ended up in the "self serve" processing 200.00 worth of groceries. To make it worse, there were several staff members standing nearby, just watching us like the mouth breathers they are.Tonight, my husband got the same treatment with much less groceries. they had closed ALL the registers a good half hour before closing. 
I may drive the extra 15 to go to Fry's now.My family of four went there for dinner the other night.  The employees seemed nice and service was good.  The food?  The food was nothing special, it is bland because they want you to customize it to your taste buds.  What ever.  For what I paid the food should of been better.  Plus why does a family pack of 10 Fish Fillets cost 49.99 with fries, coleslaw and hush puppies, when you cant get 3x 3 fish and chip plates with a 1 fish and chip plate for cheaper than if you buy the family pack?  If I buy the family pack (in other words in bulk) it should be cheaper.  All in all for the price I paid for food it just wasn't that spectacular.  Gluten free shouldn't mean they can gouge you.  I will stick with the non gluten free fish and chips at the Village Inn.Airport bars are never really great and usually leaving me wanting for more.  This place is just a notch below that.  Beer selection is lacking and food wasn't appetizing.i just started a new job that orders from here fairly frequently, so i decided to try it one day.

i ordered the chicken caesar wrap and a diet coke.

i don't know how you can screw those things up, but that's what happened. i'll probably give it another shot, but i will definitely order something different!Since this place is in a large shopping center there is a ton of parking.  I am always a bit leery when I go in for dinner and there is no one else in the restaurant and the owner/manager/server is watching TV and Reading a news paper. The restaurant is ok if a bit clutter and Asian Grocery store feeling when you come in.  I ordered the Pad See Ewe and my friend ordered Thai Green Beans. Unfortunately they were completely out of green beans... which just seemed odd.  The Pad See Ewe was ok, not really enough broccoli for my taste and not very flavorful or spicy. Can't say I would really recommend this one.Just because the server will take back a poorly mixed drink or charred beans doesn't make it a good place to eat and drink.  The food at Hula's needs to be good and consistent, not just returnable.

On a Saturday night, four of us hit Hula's at 6pm.  What's so striking when you enter is how open the bar and dining room are to the patio, which needs a few more tables and chairs, I'd say.  Central Phoenix enthusiasts love a good adaptive reuse project, and the one at Hula's, especially because of the preservation of the impressive and large hexagonal window, puts it in the same category as Postino Central and St. Francis as far as an amateur's view of architectural renovations.

We started by sharing the sweet potato fries, which are on-par with Maizie's and even those at Delux.  They were crisp, evenly cut, and intensely creamy and sweet.

After this, though, it was downhill.  Though my companions enjoyed their drinks, my Zombie, served in a tall opaque glass with a mustachioed character who looked a lot like me, was poorly mixed, lacking lime juice, and faintly soap-tasting.  The server gave me a couple minutes to weigh the drink's future, and after agreeing to suffer through it, I changed my mind and sent it back.  (The Zombie would later still appear on the bill.)  The Dark & Stormy I ordered in its place, with dark rum and ginger beer, was drinkable, but inferior to the drink of the same name at St. Francis, which, for $2 more, tastes $4 better.  I think it's in the quality of the ginger beer.

My friend's fishcakes were mostly overcooked and had to be cut with a knife, like chicken.  The ceviche, though palatable, my other friend said, appeared dry and haphazardly plated with some giant tortilla chips.

As the lone veggie in the bunch, I ordered the Spicy Tofu Tacos, which come with a spicy chili sauce and a side of rice and black beans.  Though the food came out of the kitchen quickly -- 12 minutes or so -- I wish it hadn't.  The tofu, a recently unpackaged watery brick no doubt, was merely sliced, warmed (not grilled or fried or marinated over night), and dusted with chili powder; therefore, the tofu was tasteless.  The tacos were double-wrapped in flour tortillas, which created a thick, awkward mouthfeel, so I just used one of the tortillas on each of my two tacos.  But the most disappointing part of the meal was the rice and beans, which are hard to screw up.  The black beans were so badly burned in the pot that even their juices saturated the scoop of rice with their charred, charcoal (bad) smoke flavor.  I mentioned this to the server, and she later would deduct half of the plate's $11 price (though the extra Zombie remained on the ticket).

We passed on dessert and went to St. Francis and later Fez for drinks.

Hula's would be a great happy hour spot on the patio if it offers consistent drinks and some happy hour food specials.  Two stars for potential, and I will try once more.  As it stands now, though, an accommodating server cannot compensate for an inconsistent bartender, burned beans, and uninventive vegetarian options.

note: I am totally aware that restaurants don't have to cater to my or other people's various dietary preferences (i.e., vegetarians and vegans), and that I choose to go to these restaurants.  I just want some rice and beans to rely on.I'm a regular at this bar but this is the first time I've decided to eat here. I can't say the food was terrible but I have a issue with calling something a "Shepherds pie" if it doesn't actually have SHEEP in it. Ground beef is used in a cottage pie....but it was bland regardless of the name. Also, quite over-priced. They have decent bar choices and only a quick drive from home so I do go regularly but only as a bar patron. Please be careful of your checks if paying by credit as I've been over-charged a few times. I had one of the bar tenders decide to give himself a $60 tip. Luckily, I was refunded but those "mistakes" shouldn't be happening at a place that would like to keep business.This review is based on JUST the Superstition Springs location:
My favorite kind of pizza is from BJ's. My husband and I usually get half pepperoni and half buffalo chicken as toppings. Other than a Caesar salad and a pazookie, I have not tried anything else... so this review is based on just these foods alone. The pizza is extraordinary and just one slice will make you feel full! We tried the pazookie (ice cream with a cookie) a couple of times here, but I have had better elsewhere. Actually, their pazookie makes me a little sick. Their ice-cream tastes cheap and frothy. 

Normally, I would give BJs a 4.5 star review, but because of my most recent experience at the Superstition Springs location, I am going to bring my starred review a couple notches. We invited some friends to BJs and advised them they could not go wrong with the pizza! My husband has a fatal allergic reaction to olives, so we always make sure to tell the waiter to NOT put olives on anything he eats. BJs has usually accommodated this request, and I appreciate that. However, I feel that our waitress at Superstition was largely incompetent. Well, I was correct! While we waited for our pizza (which took an hour-- it has never taken an hour, okay?) our water glasses remained empty (for an hour people!) The waitress never came to refill our glasses. We were annoyed by it, and even a little embarrassed that we had raved so much to our good friends we had invited about the restaurant. When our pizza finally came, there were OLIVES on the pizza!So disappointed! I used to always come here specifically for the caprices sandwich. Today I was served a hot mess. Literally a Caprices sandwich served hot. There's nothing more unappealing than warm shrivel up tomatoes. I also asked for extra basil, as I always do, which usually results in whole leaves of basil on my sandwich. Today it didn't appear to have any extra just thinly sliced slivers of basil laying next to the wilted hot tomatoes. Thank God their tabouli  is still to die for. I got my order to go and I should have none something was amiss when condensation was obvious inside the To Go box. And while the the thin strips of dressing on the outside of the bread may look good, they certainly make for oily hands.Hit or miss. The last time we went here, we walked out. Food is alright, nothing special. Some servers take pride in their work, but the most recent had an attitude. We downed the chips and salsa waiting for our meal and as we were drinking margaritas wanted to continue to nibble. We asked for more. This was strange as they customarily bring new before you are out... They refused to bring more and basically ignored us. They were not out of chips as they continued to bring them to new tables being sat. I went to the bar to inquire again and was told they would be right out. 5 minutes passed and then we were told our food was almost ready so we didn't need more. What!?! We paid for our margaritas and promptly exited the building.The food was okay.  The servers were not interested in selling much.  The bartender/server was very timid and almost afraid to speak up and tell us what tap beers were available. Also, we were a party of three at the bar having appetizers and she kept asking us if we wanted separate checks even though we said no.  The menu is on a chalkboard on one side of the restaurant. If you sitting at the bar, you cannot read it well given its position and the glare.  There is no written menu.  This could all be overlooked if the restaurant did well in other areas.  Unfortunately, it does not. I hope they get better help who really understand the important role they play in people actually enjoying their time there, as well as the food and beverages served.We wanted to try the 4 course meal for $75 as advertised on livingsocial.com
I will comment on each course.

menu
 Salad
 Two Field Greens Salads
 Toad Hollow Rose Pinot Noir

Salad was fine. A lot of green olives. Wine tasted like zinfandel and neither of us liked it. Rolls were good.

 Appetizer
 Portabella Oscar: Crab-Stuffed Mushroom with Asparagus and Hollandaise
 Steelhead Pinot Noir

Very bland. 3/10. Hollandaise sauce was thin and uneventful. Now we are getting worried. Was not hot but served room temp. We had to force ourselves to eat this course. Disappointing. Wine was still just ok.

 Entrée
 6-Ounce Filet Mignon with Red Skin Mashed Potatoes, Haricots Verts, and Wild Mushroom Demi
 OR
 Lobster Scallop Napoleon with Bacon Risotto Cake, Asparagus, Sun Dried Tomato Butter, and Lemon Beurre Blanc 
Cosentino "The Cab" Cabernet Sauvignon

We tried one of each. The Lobster dish was what made us try this 4-course meal. This was just bad. Risotto was harad and not fully cooked. The owner Cindi explained to us that it was intentionally "al dente". Why? Worst risotto ever. No flavoring. We exchanged it for another fillet which was good. 

 Dessert
 Gelato Sampler Trio
 Tombstone Belle Port

Gelato was ok. We liked the Port and the macaroons
Did not like the music that was playing--bad 80's music some of the time. classical would have been nice.

Summary: They tried and multiple courses was fun but we did not feel the food was of the caliber that it was worth $95 with tax and tip and we won't be back.My entire family has been going here for years until today.  I called ahead for apt as always only to be rudely told they only take walk ins now.  It seems like this policy changes depending on who answers when you call, which has become irritating as you no longer know what to expect.When you're a fan of the driods, it's not often that you wind up in the Apple Store, went with my hunny and his son,  the man just bought him the Iphone 5 32blah blah blah and was already having issues with it, and the boy well his phone just needed a little lovin to get to working right. So they set appointments and we headed off to the Apple Store.

1st impression, not impressed, could be that I'm just not into Apple/Mac products  (don't worry, in my house 2 out 4 use the iphone so not everyone thinks like me) 

We checked in and were told were to sit for the tech to come find us, a tech came up to my hunny, asked what was the issue, seem not interested in hearing about the problem or even about having to help him out, and from their it just got worst, her lack of caring about customer satisfaction was very clear, did he leave without his issue resolved, yep sure did, he is going back at another time

While my hunny was dealing with her, another tech came up to jr and he was very professional and helpful, ran a few test on it, cleaned the speakers and what not, got the phone to work faster, so this tech was helpful

So customer service is 50/50 and they seem not to care if your issue didn't get fixed.
 
Apple Store ya just don't impress me......I feel very torn about this place. I went twice and both times were lackluster. 

I want to give 1 star to the parking situation at this location. Its always full and an accident waiting to happen because it dead ends and you have to back up into oncoming traffic trying to find a parking spot as well. The two times we came here, we ended up parking in a barber shop lot across the street. You would think with this corner of shops parking would have been worked out better. Don't come and expect to find parking, ever. I know its not the gelato stores fault for bad parking, but it seriously deters any desire to come here and it just makes it frustrating.

I want to give 5 stars for the vegan flavors of gelato. I had pear and banana and they were really good. Some of the best vegan fruit flavored gelato I have ever had. 

I want to give 2 stars to the regular flavors of gelato. They just tasted like milk and melted really fast. I tried pistachio and chocolate. 

I want to give 1 star to the scoop size. I swear to god, my scoop was slightly bigger than a golf ball. And for $3? Are you kidding? Without the groupon I purchased which was $5 for $10 worth of gelato, neither time we used the full amount, I don't see myself frequenting this place as the amount is crazy.

I want to give 1 star to the workers who helped us both of the times we came in here. No joke, I told them which flavor I wanted and they asked "which one is it? Point it out." Uhh... isn't that your job to know? Its not like there were 50 flavors to choose from. I think I counted 18. So it shouldn't have been that complicated.

I am going to settle on 2 stars since that's what my total averaged out to be. I don't see myself coming back here for all of these reasons except the fruit flavored gelatos, which I wish were given bigger scoops or the prices were changed. But even for how good they are, I can't say I'll be back. Sorry.I went here a few weeks ago and have been meaning to write this review for awhile. When we went it was a Saturday afternoon, the place had more people than expected considering the location for a restaurant in that strip mall is horrible. I was excited as I had read about this place in the newspaper. Unfortunately I was rather disappointed. 

They only had one server/drink maker/busser working the front of the house. I appreciate she was busy but this was poor planning on the part of the manager as we were neglected. They took forever to take our drink and food order. Then she requested that if we need a refill we place our drink cups on the corner of the table so she can see that we needed refills, okay I get that, never had to do that before but I acknowledge at least she was trying. 

However, I ordered the Cuban panini and it was dry - very very dry. Nothing really memorable. My panini came with plaintain chips which were not that good, they were supposed to come Whit a sauce, that the waitress forgot and I had to ask for. when she brought it, it just tasted like canola oil. I also tried half of the Ropa Vieja, flavor was good but really salty. Anyhow, just disappointed I was really looking forward to a quality Cuban restaurant. I am glad we tried it for lunch and didn't spend even more money to try dinner at this place and be disappointed.The food was good, but the poor service and too loud music ruined the experience. 

We got a few menu items and shared them. I found the flavor of the Mac and cheese to be good, but too greasy. The peanut butter and jelly was good; it was like the comfort food of your childhood grew up to be just a bit more complex. But my favorite was the roast beef. If I was ever compelled to return this would be the item I would get. The heat on the horseradish was PERFECT.

Given the choice I would go next door to Humble Pie instead.I'm so over this place. I've given it so many chances, and it's just.so.mediocre. Food is bleh, drinks are expensive, atmosphere is pretentious. I know it's Scottsdale, and I'm all about the trendy, fabulous feel. But you have to deserve the crowd by delivering tasty food, good drinks, and on-top-of-it service. Culinary Dropout definitely dropped out of school when those topics were being taught. Time to restructure, Fox Restaurants.Order was supposed to be ready 20 min ago...yet here I am still waiting...not even busy!We've been here several times with our kids and grandkids.  It's a good family spot, but the service is just okay.  We love the fresh chips, and the wings are good.  Salads are 'meh'.  We'll come again because it's a good spot for the kids, but we'll come expecting not great service.Lately their customer service has not been great. Today I was told that I had to add my own Splenda to my drink after they made it. I explained that I didn't like to put sweetener on top of the foam and they told me to do it myself anyway - they didn't want to "upset someone's coffee by not doing it right." It was just 2 Spelnda not a huge variation... I guess I am back to grabbing coffee at the grocery store locations.The time it takes to catch shuttle twice from airport...plus the time in line may not be worth the savings. The line was long with not enough people working. On average you can pay $5/$10 more somewhere else and not wait for so long.The food was mediocre.  I tried the glass noodle dish, but the flavor was bland.  The beef empanadas were slightly salty.  The only thing I liked there was the chicken empanadas.  The bread cover was slightly sweet over tasty shredded chicken making a good balance.  

The cakes look good but not moist enough for my taste.We bought a deal on groupon for a month of kickboxing or karate.

The gentleman who greets folks at the door certainly deserves FIVE STARS; a younger man with a beard.  He assisted me in cleaning up my son's spill, went out of his way to make me aware of the schedule and helped me get my information to the desk while juggling my little ones.  Out of the three times we've attended classes here, he is BY FAR the most professional and noteworthy associate.

The studio, however falls short in comparison.  Patrons arriving for kickboxing must pass through the karate studio.  The Karate studio is over flowing to the brim with people, reminding me more of cattle being herded rather than people.  The classes aren't scheduled so there is not enough time to clean the mats in between... or even for people to shuffle out the front door before the next herd arrives.  Cleaning up my son's water spill brought to my attention just how disgusting this studio is as far as cleanliness.  If I am not mistaken,  my comments about the studio's cleanliness seemed to be overheard... and seemingly laughed at by management.  Hand, foot and mouth disease, anyone?

The children (ages 3-8) enjoyed the class however.  The instructor was sensitive to their ages and properly instructed the students to alternative exercises. The music was appropriate for the most part, and I too enjoyed watching the children while they punched away!  Instructor could have added a little more teaching; for example pointing out what muscle is being stretched for a sense of increased body awareness.  

We will finish out our groupon, but thus far it seems the other reviewers are right in their assertion that the owners care more about making a buck than long time customers.I would go to this place all the time when I came in from california. They don't have #portofsubs out in The OC. When I do go in the staff is generally friendly but the food is what I come here for. Today they closed about 10 min early on a Sunday. The tall, skinny, guy with the goatee said he couldn't sever me.. Even though it was 5:50pm. I went to the Starbucks next door, got a coffee and a sandwich and while sitting in my car I noticed 4 other people go to portofsubs and pull in a locked door. All within a 10 min period before 6pm. 

I just wonder what the business owner would think about these kids closing early?Never had fast food Japanese before. Wasn't sure what to expect. Got the chicken and steak combo with noodles. Also comes with veggies. Was ok. Meat was a little rubbery. Steak was better than the chicken. Not thrilled with it. Prob should have followed my instincts and went to Kyklos Greek Cafe. I know that place is awesome.I don't come in here often because the products are sub-par and the selection is limited.  We like to come here after a holiday to pick up holiday items on the cheap.  The best time is after Valentine's Day and after Halloween.....you can find some stuff for future Halloween Parties, ie plates, napkins, decorations for 75%+ off.

Will I return?  Only on those occasions above.We had went to the old Satified Frog frequently  and were excited. Ordered chicken and ribs. The chicken was not good at all. Dry overcooked yet still greasey. The ribs were tough and chewy. We had strawbwerry shortcake it was good. Its in a run down area, so was a little concerned at first. They have done a nice job with the resturant. It is nicer inside than the old one. The part that bothered me was the waitress that was doing everything, said oh yes the chicken is a little dry. Im sorry, but handed us a full check. No offer to replace with better food.Sometimes there's a place that has a lot of hype...everyone you know loves the place, and then you go there and well...it's not that good.

That's Mac Shack, don't get me wrong it's not bad, I like the concept, and the food was decent, but the portions were kind of small, the prices were fairly high, and there were some bugs on the Jalapenos.

I think if this place hadn't been as hyped as it was it may have been a little better for me, but I went in expecting the greatest mac and cheese on earth and got a plate of average.I bought a Groupon for 3 car washes. Each of these washes is normally worth $10. I got my first one today and wish I hadn't bought the Groupon. I'm giving this place 2 stars because the wash did get most of the dirt off my car (my car wasn't especially dirty though), the staff was nice, and no damage was done.  However, I am not pleased with the job done. My two main complaints are that my car was still very wet after the wash, and more annoyingly, there was a significant amount of soap on my car's trunk. 

I much prefer the car wash place near the corner of McClintock and University not that far away. For even cheaper they get all the soap off and make sure the car is dry by having people wipe it down for you. They too have free vacuums.I'll put it this way -- this place is not worth $55 for lunch for two.

Two burgers, an order of fries, a Manhattan ($10), a beer = $55 with tip. Nice little spot, but hard to justify the cost.

The burgers were decent but not rave-worthy, the glass seemed underfilled with the Manhattan - though what was there was tasty.

If you like over-spending, this place is good. If you're more value oriented, skip it.The service was fine, but the food was mediocre at best. Also, the overwhelming and unpleasant smell that hit me when I walked in sort of set a bad mark from the start of lunch. Overall it's just....meh.We played 5/25/14 for $40, but I wouldn't pay no more than $4 for this course. I gave it 2 stars cause the staff was friendly from valet to the the cart lady. but my rating for the course would be ZERO! The conditions were terrible! Greens were bumpy, patchy burnt-out greens and fairways. And the course was coming out of the winter season, the summer conditions will be much worse. I'm from the valley and know that there are plenty of courses a few miles west of az grand that are 10x better than this dog track.I should begin by stating, I love Chick-Fil-A.  I love the food, I love the soup, I love the family owned concept.  However...

I have never seen such poor customer service.  On duty was  a manager and a team leader.  There were, when we arrived, six people in the front and I could see four in the back.  By the time we had our order taken, we counted eight people up front.   Yet, no one was taking orders.  There were four chit-chatting to the side, a manager counting money...they were doing everything but assisting customers.  We waited as next in line for more than ten minutes, and my husband finally asked "Can you please wait on us?"

I don't expect perfect, but really, with that many,  people up front, someone should be able to ask if we want fries with that.I went with 3 other friends for breakfast today. This place sure doesn't look much like a diner to me. I was expecting to see a 50's diner decor inside and instead it was a remodeled Village inn. The food was OK - just OK. I don't know what they cook their eggs and hash browns in, but it made them taste weird. Must be the type of grease they use on their grill. The service was all right but I don't think I'll be back. There's many other places to go for a good breakfast in the West Valley to waste a meal on this place.I thought that after watching the Bar + Bistro on Steak Out that our food experience would be to die for.  Instead the Tapas should be listed under the soup section.  The mushrooms were the worst with two small slices of bread, can't even explain the taste, none I ever want to have again.  Not sure what drink we had since it should have been a sangria.  It was more like flavored sparkling water with no alcohol.  The only enjoyable thing we experience was the live band.  They were actually pretty good and there were people dancing.  It is a nice location and nice venue, but the food has to live up to the place.  Sorry, not going back need to have a change in the food preparation.This place is going down hill, I love Ballys but this takes the cake this trip..

1. I still will complain about the people movers being down again.  We stay there because of our feet.  I have broken my feet a few times and after walking around the convention for 3 days straight the movers are just the right thing for the end of a long day. 
2. We were upgraded to a suite, we always get this suite and I won't post why but we do.  Anyways we found dirty diapers in the suite by the windows.  $30 dining credit was issues hmmmmmmmm if I was a hotel Manager id be giving a few free nights for that. 
3. Roulette dealer was a gem A +++ there 
4. Valet driver Regina is the best ever!!!!   You have to love that after a year she still remembers my name, my wife and my son's name
5. FIX ur people movers, yes I said it again, I know its not broken, everyone on the strip turns them off before the entrance, in the hopes their legs die and you sit at a machine.I like the atmosphere, the service was (mostly) good (very accommodating to our ever increasing group), I'd just like to say that first. I have also only been once, and only had the hot chocolate (I had to rush off or I'd have had a slice of the pretty tasty looking cakes on display). So, perhaps take my review with a pinch of (smoked) salt...

I popped by at the weekend with a group of other Yelpers, in our quest to find the best hot chocolate in Edinburgh. I so wanted Urban Angel's offering to be up there, but it's actually my least favourite so far. The hot chocolate is by Edward & Irwyn, based in Morningside, and, I am assured by Cressi F, delicious in solid form. But in hot form, it was so, so disappointing.

For one thing it was £3.60 for a pretty small glass of hot chocolate! This is on par with everything else in Urban Angel, and I'll be honest and say that the high prices are the reason I've never been before (and don't intend to revisit, I mean, £8.90 for French toast, are you kidding me?!). It also wasn't that hot. And despite ordering the 'Scots Pine, Juniper and Smoked Sea Salt' hot chocolate, it tasted of nothing (not even strongly of chocolate), and what little discernible taste there was, was disguised by the sprinkling of orange chocolate on top.

So, no. I won't be back. It seems very nice inside, as I said, but the prices are waaaay too high for me to consider returning and I definitely wasn't wowed into believing that the prices were justified either.The food here wasn't horrible but the service sucked and was very slow. It took over an hour to get our food once seated. Stay away from the pizzas...they are like dense cardboard. The burger was pretty good but overpriced for what it was.i grew up thinking a crepe was golden brown in color, this one was purple or grey,  i'm not quite sure.  The chicken with swiss cheese was just alright, i certainly wouldn't rush back.  It is a very cute place, all the appointments were great, maybe they need to practice the cooking.-Very cute clothing and jewelry boutique for the conscious fashionista.

-Friendly service & unique decor with bling & virgin mary statues.

-Next to and attached to Rust & Roses (Shabby Antique treasures).

-Prices are highly marked-up...for example, I bought a jewelry piece here and saw the SAME exact one at a suburban (Westcor) Mall for almost less than half of the price! ...And the one at the mall wasn't even on sale or clearance...(are they marking stuff up like 400%??? You'd think the stuff at the mall would be WAY more expensive!)

-Recap: Yes, the clothing is "high-end boutique", but if I wanted to spend $70 bucks on a blouse, I could probably buy LOTS of blouses at Ross or Marshall's...heck, I've even found bargains at Dillard's! As long as it covers my ta-ta's, it doesn't matter if it was $70 bucks or $7.99...

-Worth the visit to look...

-Parking was not too bad...park in front or on the side street.We decided to check it out for 1$ Tapas night, what a great deal, especially when you want to try something new.
The place was nice and staff was friendly. Drinks were good. All the tapas we had were average, nothing spectacular, the price made it worth it.
The only true complaint I had was that we were a party of 2 starting out at the bar, about an hour later we moved to a table with 5 other friends, we asked the waitress to cash us out before we moved, to make the whole check at the end of the night easier...she said not to worry about it, she'd take care of it. My other friends reminded her at the table that the majority of us would need seperate checks...again she said it wouldn't be a problem. As the night of ordering a plethora of food and drink, we noticed she never wrote anything down and when the food/drink was delivered it was never presented to who had ordered it, we even commented on it and she laughed it off.  When we asked for our bill, she presented it to us, said apologized that she couldn't split it up and left. We sat there bitched about it, then took on the task of remembering what everyone ordered and tried to tally it up seperately.  (Not so easy after a few martinis) We also noticed she charged us all automatic gratuity for our party larger than 6...even though most of my bill was from at the bar, where it was only a party of 2!! I think she knew what she was doing when she wouldn't cash us out earlier in the night.                                                 
 We should've complained to management at that time but we all just wanted to leave.   My friend and I both wrote to Match on their website to complain about the night, it's been 2 weeks and still no response...I guess they don't care about return business. .**Review Edited 7/20/2010 - Previously had 5 stars, now only 2**

I **used to** LOVE the SUSHI!

I have been a few times, and each time it is clean, the servers are very nice and fairly quick, and the food **was** TO DIE FOR. We always order sushi, and I haven't tried any of their regular menu items except the seaweed salad (YUM, I get it to go so I can eat it the next day at work).

The place is very clean. Sometimes you walk into a sushi joint and it smells like fish. GROSS! It is nicely decorated and a very pleasant atmosphere.
 
The staff is wonderful. I have chatted with the owner a few times, and she is there often (even with another location in Henderson). The sushi chefs **were** loud and boisterous, which is a blast, and if you would rather have a quiet night, you can just sit in a booth, where the servers are efficient and very nice. **But tonight we went, and Jjanga and Woody were gone!!!!!! I was not thrilled with the new sushi chefs. They were very nice, but their sushi was nothing like Jjanga's or Woody's; the new sushi is your typical, generic, anywhere sushi.**

The food: I was a fan of another sushi restaurant for many years, and would only eat sushi there, but when we got the 50% off for nearby residents, I decided to venture out, and now The SUSHI **was** the ONLY place I **would go, until now**! There are tradiditonal rolls, sashimi, and some of their specialty rolls have hilarious names with super tasty and inventive ingredients. A few of my favorite rolls (of the ones I have tried so far): The Nevada Roll, What The Heck #1 and #2, The Hot Woody, the Jjanga rolls (every one of the "Jjanga's Rolls" and "Woody's Rolls" are awesome), **(Note, now you cannot get ANY of the previously mentioned rolls made correctly - the new chefs read the old menu and try to make them, but they never turn out.)**, and Who's Your Ex-Wife?. Get anything with the spicy garlic ponzu sauce and you will be a happy camper, trust me!

**I am really disappointed in my last trip to The SUSHI, and I don't really feel inclined to go back. As we sat at the sushi bar, we heard no less than five people ask for rolls from the old menu, as we did, and then were disappointed with their orders. I don't know what happened, but The SUSHI really lost out when they lost Jjanga and Woody!!!**After a great day out and about, we crashed hard in the hotel room and woke up to find that everything was pretty much closing down. In a city that appears to never sleep, this was kind of disappointing. 

We were tired but hungry. We thought about walking the strip to find something but couldn't even bother to leave the hotel so after walking around a bit to find something - anything that was open at our hotel - we settled upon this place. 

Munchbar has an interesting view. If you like to see scantily clad women dancing with your dinner, this is your place. We were tired and not too interested so we sat elsewhere with basically a view of the slots but whatever. We just wanted food.

The waitress was really perky for a late night. We were probably grumpy and just wanted food but she didn't catch on and kept trying to cheer us up and make small talk. Maybe she thought she wouldn't get a good enough tip if she didn't do so but in all honesty, we just wanted her to do her job and leave us alone. We were still groggy from our super long nap and a little irritated that we slept so long. You don't come to Vegas to sleep!

My friend got the grilled cheese with the tomato soup and I got the chicken caesar wrap. After about two bites of food, we both decided we weren't impressed then we thought it was maybe because we were tired and ate some more unfortunately nothing changed after a few more bites. Her grilled cheese wasn't very cheesy. I think the cook only put one slice of cheese in the sandwich and it was a very weak flavor. The tomato soup tasted like a can of tomatoes with no flavors or spices at all. 

My wrap was heavily dressed. There was hardly any chicken or tomato all I got was a lot of lettuce and dressing and because of the overwhelming amount of dressing, the lettuce was super soggy. Bleh. The fries that came with the wrap were warm and later became ice cold. I couldn't even enjoy the fries. We ended up eating half of our meals and then going to a Walgreens to see if we could find something to supplement the bad experience.I have stayed at this hotel multiple times and enjoyed it before but this time around I was very disappointed. We got there the room was clean but it didn't  have a blanket on the bed I called a total of 3 times to get one and finally I received one the next day in the afternoon.  There was a cup on the patio with cigarette butts and liquid in it they didn't pick up until next day.  The air conditioning unit worked half of the time.  There wAsn't any conditioner in the room and we called room service and Addiction was closed for the day because of a special event which I was bummed about because their food is good. So overall experience wasn't good this time around but in the past I was very happy there.I'm trying really hard to like this place.  I've been twice so far.  Based on the review on Diners, Drive-ins, and dives, I had high hopes.  So far I am somewhat disappointed.  Service is pretty slow.  Food seemed to take forever to come out and it wasn't that busy.  It's a dive which is no problem as long as the food and service make up for the decor.

First visit.  I ordered the Guinea Pie which was OK, but not really special.  For one thing I though it was really bland except for the garlic.  No spice to speak of.  Toppings really sparse and the crust super thin.  Pound for pound I'd consider it pretty expensive for pizza.  It was good enough that I will probably try again with a different pie.  Service was kind of weird.  I ordered at a window, but paid a waitress who took it to the bar.  There is really no place to wait for to go orders except the bar.  If it was quick I'd have no issue with that, but it seemed to take forever.

Second visit.  I ordered a sandwich called the meathead which is Braised beef, two cheeses, carmelized onion, pickle and creamy mustard.  I got the footlong one for $10, which is reasonable price for a steak sandwich.  My opinion:  You'll get much better steak sandwiches at Pops on Rainbow.  This one had a good bun and enough meat, but the problem was the meat was excessively dry like it was grilled too long and then there is the cheese.  Apparently when they say two cheeses they mean two little slices of cheese.  I've never seen a steak sandwich with as little cheese and the cheese was not mixed into the meat at all.  It was placed on the bun and this big bunch of meat was placed on top.  the pickle was interesting as well as the mayo sauce, but overall it was almost too dry to eat.  I was greeted immediately, they took my order quick, and brought drinks and refills fast.  Getting the sandwich was pretty slow for a sandwich.  I have no big complaints.

I will give this place one more shot.  If they do better I might revise my review with another star.Overly price tiny wings with poor service. Not much else to say.I called them on phone and asked if I could get my brakes done.  I explained that the lugs were too tight and the key seemed partially stripped, perhaps because the Big O had rotated my tires last week and must have overtightened the lugs.  I also asked if they could replace the entire set of lug nuts too so that I would not have a problem going forward.  "not a problem, bring it down" was the response.  

1.5 hours later I get a call explaining that I need to pick up the vehicle because the lugs are too tight and they are worried about sheering a stud.  

Could have saved me quite a bit of time and hassle by explaining that it may be a problem they can't handle.  

Kevin was polite enough, just not able to properly evaluate my job upfront.Small. 

There is a volleyball net bisecting the pool, but no volleyballs. All they had was very light weight beach balls. 

Shallow - the deepest part was 4'. 

Too much shade. Because of where it is situated with the buildings, at least half of the lounge chairs and pool are in entire shade at all times. 

NYNY guests can use their room key to get into the Monte Carlo pool next door. I highly suggest it. They have a regular pool, a wave pool, a lazy river, and an out of water sand volleyball court.I know these guys have a strong, dedicated following.  But I've tried it a few times and I strongly feel that their food is tasteless and makes you feel endlessly bloated.  Service and atmosphere are equally mundane.  The best thing about this place is the salsa bar.  But it is often messy and depleted.Misleading, and very low quality burgers......McDonalds Angus Style......it sucked. Nuff Said. Only if there is nothing left to eat....go here.

Whoever wrote the other reviews has never set foot into a real Burger place that has the Fresh Ground beef.

They have the kitchen to do it......buy a meat grinder and start grinding daily, charge more and make more.....and watch your sales GROW!Service is a negative 5..  atmosphere is 5   ...   paul Wells, the one man band is great.....  Service on the other hand was the worst I have ever seen.... I was never offered even a water or a wine or beer or a cocktail or A CIGAR. .  Heck the food & beverage management from Orange Sky Restaurant (Kieth) came down to talk with us regarding my situation.  He did offer a free round of cocktails that we kindly refused.  After whichhe offered a free aappetizer at the restaurant we had reservations for the next nigjt.     While walking to the restroom at the end of our night I saw the server and at that point asked her name.  She said it was Michelle. .  I then asked why shy never offered us any type of service?  She did not respond.... I then asked "Do you not like usfor some reason?"   We aare a mixed race couple. ...  Her rezponse was a very lgreatsmile and walk away...

Is Shadows Racist????

Are the Sunday night wait staff Racist???

If not,  We felt they were....

(Author is a Retired Firefighter and a County Public Health Enployee)Nothing to rave about here.  Too much money for fair sushi. They add a 15% regardless of the group size.Went here with a groupon yesterday evening after seeing a movie. Started out nice. Sat on the patio, ordered a glass of wine with my bf. The server was friendly and fairly helpful. We ordered a cheese plate. My bf doesn't do cow milk so the cheese menu was inviting to him since there were several goat and sheep choices. Not my thing but he was happy. So far so good . The minute the cheese arrives these two meat-heads light up cigars 10 ft away on the patio couches. I asked the server if it was allowed and he said yes. I asked to speak to the manager and he said he was the manager. He told us they were allowed to smoke there since it was 25 ft from the entry door. GROSS!!!! Just what I want to smell when eating. So we moved inside which really pissed me off. Why should someone's nasty habit make me have to sit inside. Back to the food. My bf enjoyed the cheese. Nothing special, cheese, grapes, nuts, bread. I ordered the pasta puttanesca. Nothing special here either. The server/manager said it was his favorite thing on the menu if he wasn't eating pizza. It was a lot of pasta and maybe 4 small pieces of asparagus, tomato and supposedly kalamata olives although I never found any. Oh yes and 2 small pieces of artichoke hearts. For $11 they could have thrown in more veggies. It wasn't a horrible experience but I doubt I'll go back. Wish it had been better as I'd like to see businesses here be successful. Cigar smoke is just the worst though and I can't understand why a restaurant (not a bar) would allow it on their patio.Not impressed...I'll stick to my fave - Smashburger.My husband and I decided we wanted to try a sweet we never had before and while we were at the Nitty Gritty we saw a Gigi's Cupcake car go past the window so we went there. My husband got the wedding cake and Kentucky Bourbon Pie while I chose the Strawberry and Cream cupcake and the Lemon Cheesecake. I have to say I was very disappointed with the sweets. The cakes were good but the frosting was so overly sweet I could not finish it. The Kentucky Bourbon Pie was moist but very heavy and again, overly sweet. I loved the lemon cheesecake but took off the frosting that ringed the lemon filling because of its sweetness. It is too bad the frosting could not be more like the frosting at Carl's Cake..I would then pay the price they are asking for cupcakes. That will be our first and last visit to this establishment.I went here because my son spilled apple juice on my phone and it turned off. After going to the AT& T store and the apple store I came here in hopes of repairing my phone or hearing that I needed I new one.

They fixed it in 1 hour and everything worked great! I was shocked! They did tell me to back up my device, as my phone might die someday( they mentioned 6 months to 8 months as a possibility from their prior experiences but couldn't give me an exact date) and that iphones are never the same after water damage. He let me know that I was on borrowed time.  I payed $70 total with the discount and tax. It was less then the insurance of $200 and I didn't have to get a gophone to use until I could save the money.

Well, the next day my phone stopped taking calls, being on "searching" no matter where I was. I went home and backed up my files before taking it in, and my phone got stuck on itunes mode.

When I took it it, they kept it for an hour and then told me my phone was now stuck in restore mode and would not restore due to a hardware/motherboard issue and it was now a brick. I had a 30 day warranty- but because they didn't fix the motherboard issue the DAY BEFORE it doesn't count, and YESTERDAY everything has been working fine. They refunded me the cost of the new battery ($30), but wouldn't refund the labor.

 I understand that, as they DID put time and effort into trying to fix it, but I can't help but feel I've been had. I basically gave them $40. I wish they would have just told me that my phone was gone or taken a few more moments to check everything. It seems convenient that they let me know that my phone is on borrowed time and to back everything up and then the NEXT DAY it up and dies.

If you have water damage of ANY kind you best bet is to go and buy a $75 GoPhone with a touch screen from Walmart. It's not an Iphone- but at least it's new. I feel like they know when iphones are DOA and they use it to get easy money- that or they overlooked something and it cost me time, money, and heartache. They also have used iphones at gamestop!

II ended up buying a GoPhone anyway. Waist of time for me, but if you have a broken screen, button, or something easy I think these guys will do a good job. Just don't expect miracles and when they say they don't guarantee things and your phone might just give out- believe them and move on.The reason you get two stars here and not one is the fact that the wait staff is good and the food was decent. However the decor is drab, and well past it's prime. I was here for a conference, and therefore there was not too much of choice to get a cold one and watch the game. There were several TV's, although most of them were small and this place is pretty crowded when you get 15 or 20 people inside. The food was pretty good I must admit, but again the stale green carpet and dark wood paneling leave a little to be desired.All the locals recommended this place as one of the best burger places in town.

The ambiance and decor is nice but the food was just OK. What we had:

1. Turkey sliders - good
2. Lobster Rolls - good
3. Earth Burger - good
4. Non alcoholic milkshakes - good
5. Sweet potato fries- meh

They start you off with a small pail of popcorn. And then they bring your shakes and then the food takes a long time in coming. Our lunch for 4 came to $96 with tip. 

If you go, you are going more for the experience and the ambiance rather than the quality of the food. Good to try once but you can certainly find better.My expectations were pretty high for this place given that it has a nice modern decor, is helmed by Chef David Myers, and had a couple of friends hyping this place up.  

Needless to say by my rating, this place sucked pretty bad.  Let me give you a little run down...

The burger was ordered medium but it was WAAAAY overcooked, not even pink in the center.  It was so overly salted that I couldn't even enjoy the meat.  The cole slaw that they slap on top didn't help either, relegating this burger to Diner status, all 20 dollars of it.

The escargot was mediocre.  Although they try to trick you by giving you 15 escargots in one dish, all of them are flavorless and dry.  Could it hurt you to add a little bit more butter?  Even a hint of garlic would have helped ...

The lamb shank was pretty tasty.  It's fall of the bone tender and was seasoned correctly.  One extra star for this dish.

Currently, if you check-in on foursquare, you get a free dessert.  I opted for something bizarre so I chose the Olive Oil Parfat.  This was very tasty but I wouldn't want to pay $10 for this tiny little thing... (that's what she said?)

Service was decent, but it seemed that the waiter didn't really care too much...just seemed like he wanted the day to end quickly.  

I would definitely recommend that you pass on this expensive eatery, it's not worth the money.I don't get this place.  Hamburger squished so thin that it goes over the sides of the bun?  How does this help?  And the meat is so over salted that you don't actually taste anything else.  I tried the chicken sandwich to stay away from the "smash"; no luck.

There is an In-N-Out burger next door to this Smash Burger.  I recommend going to it instead.For the price of this buffet you'd think that it would have tons of food to choose from but no it was just average. I went on a Saturday for brunch and I maybe ate about four items. The best thing about the brunch was the Gelato! I got the fried chicken and something that it was seasoned with did not agree too well with my stomach! This buffet might be good to others but it just wasn't good to me! I would have given it one star but the service was good and so was the Gelato.This bar is stunning.  The chandelier decor, the seating - all so pretty.
Unfortunately this is where my praise ends.  My best friend and I sat at the bar and were helped by a bartender with the "I'm helping you; you're not helping me" attitude.  Snooty, not even a smile or attempt at a warm greeting.  His nose was literally up in the air.  Then his fellow bartender came along to try to persuade him to open a bar with him - all in front of us!  Then we were graced by the presence of one of the waitresses, who proceeded to pass us while looking us up and down.  Of course, the usual - no smile or welcoming greeting.  For the FIRST TIME EVER we gave absolutely no tip to express our complete dissatisfaction.  
We then went to the adjacent wine store and when the associate asked us how we were doing, my friend told him just how awful our service was.  He was extremely apologetic and suggested we go to a bartender that was on the outskirts of the bar.  Too bad our first experience with this bar wasn't with him (unfortunately forgot his name or I would mention it here).
Total waste of a gorgeous bar.Since we were staying at the hotel we thought to have a quick breakfast here. 

It is located on the fourth floor right next to the pool area. 

When we entered the hostess greeted us and let us know to wait a couple of minutes while an outside table was being cleared. A minute later she lead us to the table that overlooked the pool and handed us the menus. 

Very small breakfast/lunch menu. I ordered the ciabatta breakfast sandwich (sub. the fried eggs for egg whites) and asked for fruit instead of fried potatoes. And lots of coffee. 

Cheechee was our sever and he was fabulous! Very accommodating and always checked on my coffee mug and water. They never went empty. He made small talk about 4th of July and asked about our stay. 

After about 20 minutes the food arrived. The sandwich was an average portion, made the way I had requested but the bacon was mainly all fat. I had to take half the bacon out which left the sandwich a little wimpy. 

Prices are high for what the food is worth and portion. The sandwich was $14.00,  hub's red velvet waffle was $14.00 and regular brewed coffee was $4.00. After tax  and tip was close to $40.00. 

With the better breakfast/lunch spots around I wouldn't come back.Too expensive $12. I never got in cause of the price my baby is only 10 mos old and the owner wouldnt even give us a discount. I endend up going somewhere bigger and only paid $5 and $10 for 4 yr old.this is a typical americanize version of jack of all trades. hawaiian, chinese and japanese food all in one place.
went here for local yelp get together. wife had a chinese food and I tried the japanese food (sushi). 
if you come here for the sushi. skip
if you come here for a quick chinese food, this one will be fine. I wouldn't call it authentic chinese food though. its more like your typical chinese fast food @your local mall.I've been wanting to try this place for a while now since it is within  a few miles of where we live.  I finally was able to stop by and ordered the spaghetti and meatballs to go.
While waiting for the order, I sat at a very comfortable barstool and was able to check out the dining room and look at the dinner menu.  I found the place to be somewhat cold, it definitely needs some ambiance. I enjoy minimalist interiors as much as the next person, but a couple of fresh flowers on the tables would go a long way here.
When I returned home and opened my order, at first I thought they had made a mistake - the spaghetti looked like it was a children's order.  In addition, instead of the red marinara sauce I expected, the sauce was an orange color, like Chef Boyardee in a can. The pasta was the thick type of spaghetti, not the thinner, spaghettini type traditionally used in Italy,  and some sort of cheese was melted over it, also a no-no in traditional Italian kitchens. It tasted terrible - the pasta wasn't cooked al dente, it was overcooked and rubbery, the sauce had no taste and the tasteless cheese just made rubbery mess out of the whole dish. The meatballs were just okay, and again, they had the mystery cheese melted over them, which took away from their taste.
I am willing to give them another chance and would love to try some of the other pasta dishes, such as the papardelle with pork sauce,  but I would NOT recommend the spaghetti and meatballs to anyone.I have always enjoyed myself when I have come here and in fact have taken friends here, Their food was delicious and their martinis were very good, However I was surprised by the customer service on this visit, When we sat down we asked about the 12.00 to 5.00 special in regards to $5.00 burgers. We were about 15 minutes late, The waitress said it was no problem and we proceeded with the order.
     The waitress then came back after about 5 minutes and proceeded to tell us we needed to order a drink with our meal. Which was fine, so we got some beverages. The waitress came back again to tell us that we could not get the deal and we would have to pay full price. After I complained the manager gave us a couple dollars off but I feel that it was not enough and we should have received the deal.
     I did not complain further at the table and we ate our meal which was above average; however I feel that our business was not really valued and will not be dining there again.  I understand that mistakes happen and the waitress was new but if we  ordered alcoholic beverages that we were not going to order and then we have to pay extra for things. The service was meh . . .  That's all there is to it,Staff ok, nothing special. Burgers ok, for the price and taste.  In and out beats five guys for price, taste and customer service. CAUTION- if you get fries and burger to go.. Grease went thru the paper bag and onto my car seatAbsolutely unimpressive. Went here for lunch yesterday with a couple of workmates. Which was a Tuesday - a day on which, inexplicably, all other Vietnamese restaurants in the area are CLOSED - so at least this was an initial point in their favour. If you've read my other Vietnamese restaurant reviews you'll know that I only ever eat pho (dac biet) and was planning to order that here. Eyes popped out of my head when I saw that they charge $10 for a bowl! There also weren't different sizes for the dish, so I guessed (correctly, as it turns out) that they only had a small size. Still, I decided to give it a shot. I also noticed that their menu was extremely limited - there were almost more varieties of spring roll, which I HATE, than pretty much any other food category. The waiter told us that they were famous for their rolls.. whatever. I got the pho.

It was a small size. Of course.

In fact, the amount of pho in the bowl was positively pissant. Within maybe five minutes I had finished it off completely and was still quite hungry. And just like Saigon Kitchen in Surprise, they served a small fistful of bean sprouts, some pathetic wilted basil, and a couple of tiny slices of lime. Basically a kids-meal-sized amount of garnish. Oh, and a tiny dish with nothing on it (arguably to contain sauce, though there was no sriracha or anything else on the table). The broth was almost tasteless and there were no tendon pieces at all. Trust me, I looked hard. I spent the next ten minutes fishing forlornly, and mostly unsuccessfully, for strands of noodles at the bottom of the broth.

They had a telly showing the Olympics above the bar. Unfortunately, half the communal dining benches face the opposite direction so I had to watch Sally Pearson take gold in the women's 100m hurdles in an ornate mirror. That was the high point of the experience.

They then gave us the wrong bill, which was presented as a receipt pinned to a small block with a cheap wooden clothespeg. Might as well have printed it on a sheet of sh1tter paper too.

Won't be going back. Barely got two stars. I'm happy to wait out the "Vietnamese weekend" - ie Tuesday - in future, and grab a bowl of pho that's twice the size and thrice the flavour for three bucks cheaper at Pho Thanh, Da Vang, Maxim or 43rd Express. If you like spring rolls, knock yourself out. If you like pho, freakin' avoid this place like the plague. Remember, New India Bazaar is a couple hundred yards down the road, and THEY have all you can eat - and all the flavour you need - for $8. I couldn't agree more with Matthew K - the value IS way out of line.Third visit was lower than second, which was lower than first.  Excellent service, but declining food quality.  Bacon was chewy, eggs ordered "over hard" were nearly raw in the middle.  Manager was rude to me and snapping at the help, who were doing a wonderful job.  Must have been having a very bad day.  I might try them one more time, but probably will move on to better places.Meh, it's ok. Eggs were sub-par, corn beef hash was out of the can, bacon was chewy and cold. Pancakes were pretty good, but you can find similar quality at other places. Service was extremely quick but server was a bit disconnected. All in all, i'd pass.I a rooting for this small business, but they just miss the mark here.among the dirtiest i've seen...compliments the filthy target store that it's in...yuk!  let's not even talk abt the torn up parking lotDid not get the bartender's name, but this guy is "Mr. Bartender". He must be aiming for bartender of the year with his wittiness and personal comments directed at each regular. He does seem nice and friendly, so that's good, but maybe a bit over the top for my taste. Speaking of taste, the pastrami was a hot mess. THey claim they make it in-house and if true, they need a new recipe. It was chewy and hard to eat. After the first bite, I knew I wasn't eating this thing and to their credit they took it right off the bill. I don't care that they sell "20 of these a day"..those twenty people obviously are not fans of pastrami. The best ones are crumbly and outside of NY, only Denver gets it right. A few beer specials at $4 and some strange girl came inside handing out candy canes as well. The TV's at the bar are horrible, something needs to be changed because you have to squint to see the screens and they are old as the hills. This is sports bar that just opened right? Upgrade your TV's and change the bar confiqeration because right now it stinks.My aunt raved about this family that used to cook amazing Mexican food out of their house years ago. After she heard that they opened a restaurant, we decided to go one night. The food was decent but the service was almost nonexistant. After being there for about an hour I managed to get 1 refill of my drink.

The fajitas were good but they only gave 2 small tortillas. I ended up eating most of it with just a fork. Didn't feel very fajita-ish to me.

The salsa was good but my family complained that even the mild was pretty hot. I like heat so I enjoyed it.Terrible.  WAY overpriced for very small portions of low quality sushi.  The smallest rainbow roll I've ever received.I am sorry, but WAY overpriced. I paid $2.99 for a greek yogurt. It wasn't even a fancy brand. I can get Skyr at Sprouts for cheaper. My bad. I didn't notice the price tag. They do not have the price of items on display. You have to search the product for a price tag. 

I looked at prices and in general way too pricey. I guess you are paying for the convenience. I think AJ's Fine Foods is better and less expensive. 

Never again.Ehhh.

I'd like for this place to be something.  Right now it feels a lot like a stereotypical 'church' coffee shop.  If this place was rated on food alone, I could up the ante a bit.  I'd call this closer to an American cafe, than a coffee shop - maybe I'm just too snobby.

Some of the baked goods and foods were well done / thought out.  Some things left me hanging on a questionable note.  It's my assumption the coffee isn't a major focus here.  So be it.

All that said, I've seen shops go from this to greatness.  Even in the PHX-Metro area, nearly identical shops have gone from this to some of the best in their area.  Perhaps given time, this will become something special.  If you're in the area, just need a nibble and don't find yourself brewing over beans, roasts, grinds, dosing and the like, this is a place you should perhaps check out.It's difficult to be a fan of the DMV.
No matter what day you go there a line has formed at the entrance before they've opened.  You go inside and there's a line throughout the day.
You get a number and then stand in another line.
Staff is cordial at best.Burgers are pretty good. You'll leave smelling like a burger, for sure. Fries are ok. Nothing super special overall. Pretty basic. Need a quick burger fix it will do the trick.Had a good late breakfast there, and it was good.  Went back for their walleye today and we were very disappointed. Bill was $36 for two walleye dinners and one diet coke.  We had been looking forward to the walleye being from Minnesota.  We tried.The owner colored my hair and put a rinse on it.  Hair turned green and very dry.
 I got a second opinion and was told my hair was too porous to ever have a rinse put on it. That person agreed my hair was green.
I told the owner what happened. She responded: "you are someone who should just let your hair go natural" and turned her back on me. 
I have been coloring my hair for 40 years. 
When I first went to her it was because of another issue (breakage after color) and she thought the other person should have refunded my money. Not only did she not offer a refund, she summarily and rudely dismissed me  (and in front of other people). I was not asking for a refund but was hoping for some suggestions to address the texture and color.
Since then I have gone elsewhere and have an excellent color again.I am a HUGE fan of Pita Jungle. The last experience was a disappointment and was the first time my husband had been there. The staff (both coming on and leaving) were hanging around eating and drinking with aprons on. The food was just so-so. I usually LOVE their pita bread but the stuff we got seemed like it was just some dried up store bought stuff. We just stopped in for tapas and a drink and I doubt we will return to this location for a full meal any time soon. :(We decided to go here for lunch as it's close to my work. The food itself wasn't anything special. I ordered a chicken roll. The roll took a very long time for them to make & arrive at the table ... Wasn't worth the wait. It had a few pieces of chicken, bell peppers & onions and some really tart sauce in it. I wouldn't order it again.Why? Whyyyyy...can't people drive in this shopping plaza? The only time you stop is at the stop signs, otherwise do not stop!!Hrmm...had to try it. Cheesy.
It was either this place or the healthy Mediterranean place across the way. Pssh...I'm in Vegas betch.

We were "admitted" to this place and given a hospital gown and bracelet. The nurse was hot, so was the doctor. This sounds like the beginning of some smut film. Our nurse sat us down and I felt like I was in the looney bin. 
Some folks were getting shots in syringes, wine in bags, and paddles to their caboose. All very strange and quite entertaining. 

We ordered a single bypass burger, which we split because they don't split the bigger burgers. If you don't finish your burger, that's a paddling. Burger toppings are limited, possibly to deter people from getting all fancy. When the burger and fries arrived they just looked sloppy. And I'm all for a sloppy burger, but it looked disgusting. Definitely not the best burger I've had. It was actually pretty bland considering it had chili on it. I realized that I was basically paying for the ambience. I washed it down with a Mexican Coke and took some candy cigarettes to go.  Now that I've done it I won't be back here.Grabbed lunch here yesterday. I often visit the location in Tempe for lunch from work so I know the food and selection of sandwiches is great,

However, this located was very poorly organized, the seating was limited and the hair was obviously not set low enough. The line to order is located down a narrow walkway towards the back of the shop. 

I will stick with grabbing lunch at the location by place of business. :-(This place was recommended to us... Beer only. But it was pricey, warm and the happy hour didn't look much better so we didn't bother to come back. The guy who greeted us at the door was overly eager and excited to see new/more people. The bartender was lackluster and didn't know how to make an eclipse and it wasn't great even when I told her how to make it. This is a one time only visit.I'm an Italian-American from the NJ/NY area. Sorry, North doesn't do it for me. Some of the flavor ideas/combinations to me are a little bizarre and don't work. The ricotta gnocchi with short rib and horseradish crema to me was like eating a steak sandwich, rather than a pasta dish.  I just wasn't a fan of the flavors-well, the horseradish crema-which was the ONLY flavor in the dish. And as another reviewer pointed out, the pasta did have some oil (or butter?) visibly separating, which was a little unappetizing. My husband had the "house specialty," the pasta bolognese, which also wasn't so good. Limp pasta and sausage-heavy bolognese. -No depth of flavor, one note.  Sorry, fresh, delicious pasta dishes shouldn't be that hard to achieve for an Italian restaurant.  Fox Concepts' Olive and Ivy is much better!!!  It's consistently great. I also happened to have a yummy pasta dish at Fox Concepts' Arrogant Butcher - it was a sweet potato pasta dish. When combined with some of my husband's steak, that was pretty delicious. Without the meat for some savoriness, it was a bit sweet.Love the food, ambience, and drink but tonight we obviously overstayed our welcome. After ordering two entrees and a bottle of Moscato our server seems to want us to hurry out the door unless we are ordering dessert. Weird though because the restaurant isn't very busy at the moment and if were allowed to relax and have our girls dinner I'm sure we would be in the mood to order more drink and dessert. Wish Tim was here tonight because I promised my friend a great experience now I'm not sure she will come back. And I may but not anytime soon.So, this place has a pretty decent ambiance to it, dimly lit with old black and white movies playing behind the bar. It's a pretty chill spot, and they offer food so that's pretty cool, nothing really stands out from their food menu besides the mussels which were hella tasty. 

However, the name is mob BAR, so, you kind of expect to do more drinking at this kind of place.

I was here about a month ago and ordered a mojito. It's gross and tastes like flat soda water, my boyfriend takes the drink back, the bartender/manager of the place tastes my drink and is like, OHHH, i forgot to add syrup.

......riiiiiiight.

So whatever, he remakes the drink. Actually, he technically doesn't even remake it, he just adds the syrup to my original drink. No mint leaves, no sugar cane stick of deliciousness. ok, FINE, and he doesn't even comp the drink. thats cool, whatever.

i'm here over the weekend. stupidly, i order a mojito again, because shit, i fucking like them, AGAIN, the mojito tastes like garbage. i ask the same manager/bartender to remake the drink. he gives a lame excuse about the soda being weird on his end of the bar blah blah blah just make the drink. I try the new mojito, its bland and somewhat flat again.

I'm irritated at this point, and I ask him what the deal is, and why my friends mojito (made by a different bartender) tastes correct, and mine doesn't. He goes back to the whole "soda on his side of the bar is weird", excuse, so i ask him, "why dont you make my drink with the soda from that end of the bar, or better yet fix the soda on this end instead of making bad drinks". At this point, he actually shrugs at me, and i go, "I'm sorry, but aren't you the manager?" 

"I'm the manager, not the technician". That is what the manager says to me, he walks away and does not even offer to comp the drink when i ask for just a water instead. 

AWESOME customer service, jackass. i get that mojitos can be somewhat of a pain in the ass to make, but c'mon, this isn't supposed to be some dive bar, i thought this was a nicer place than that so i expect the drinks to be somewhat decent. 

in closing, chill place, the other bartenders are nice, the food is ok, do NOT get a drink made by the "manager/bartender".I love and respect Mayor Goodman, but when it comes to a steak, we can all do better. 

I only heard one good review, and it was from this guy named David Sadjak, who lives by the motto; "A free meal always tastes better".

He loves Bucca Di Pepo, and every second rate buffet in town, that gives him free or half priced food, and in his case, someone else was buying.

I had to see for myself. I can only sum it up one way;

On Anthony Bourdain's programs, he always tastes the food and then raves how good it is. If he has nothing good to say, he just doesn't say it. He talked with Mayor Goodman about the "old days" of Las Vegas, and did not say one thing about the food.

Since I can't say anything nice, out of respect to Mayor Goodman, and his service to the City, I will simply not say anything.Extremely noisy environment but should be expected from a family location. It took an hour for us to receive our food (one of the worst feelings in the world is watching people who were sat well after you, receive their food first). They had apparently "lost" our ticket in the window. They did pay for our drinks (one mimosa and two orange juices), but overall, we were tired and not looking to wait around an hour for sub par food. Two stars for our server who was a nice guy and tried to make the situation tolerable. 

I'll go to The Cracked Egg down the road 10/10 times.Phoebe is fantastic but the owner needs to get her act together. I came in seeing a price outside for $34 for a mani/pedi. Assuming gel would be a bit more, this seemed reasonable to me. Overall my service was good, Phoebe did a great job and was very detailed.   My rating is based on my interaction with the owner, who could use a little business etiquette class.  When Phoebe was reviewing the cost with me, I simply asked how much extra was the gel from their posted price outside. The owner tells me $30.  So I said it's $30 extra for gel? She says no, that's how much a gel manicure is. We kept going back and forth on how much extra the gel was, because as a consumer I was asking what I was paying for. She refused to answer my question-even though I must've asked it about 5 times. And she wondered why I got frustrated with her refusal to answer. The cost for what I got wasn't unreasonable, however it shouldn't be too much to ask what the variables are in your total. Also, when customers add on services that aren't standard, then they should be informed how much extra they are going to be.  And standing there arguing like a broken record makes you look bad as a business owner. I don't understand how difficult it is to answer simple questions.We were really looking forward to shopping here but were disappointed.  It is cute but the candy is not very special - many very ordinary items you can buy in the grocery store at highly inflated prices.  We had a local "deal" coupon but even with that the prices were high and the selection boring.  Also, when we got home and tried a few pieces, we found that many are not fresh.  (Maybe better turnover of product when more tourists are here?)  Anyway, wouldn't recommend or go back.Everything was a little too overpriced (yeah, I know, it's Vegas, but still). The iceberg wedge was an insulting size, it was a half wedge of lettuce, (probably couldn't even feed a rabbit with it) add chicken on that thing and you're paying $19 for a half wedge with chicken strips. Not cool. The $19 burger was solid but it was cooked medium when I asked for it to be rare, and I was also given the wrong beer (Wasatch Pumpkin instead of the Dogfish Head Punkin). Service was pretty good though. Will not return.If you advertise AYCE Korean BBQ, you should have the general decency to bring out more than one order of Galbi at a time for a party of six. We would order "2 Galbi and 1 Brisket" and would receive 1 Galbi and 1 Brisket. We would then order "2 Galbi and 1 Ribeye" and would receive 1 Galbi and 1 Ribeye. The game became predictable, and frustrating. Repeat 6 or 7 times and you begin to think that there's a big sign in the back (in Korean) that says "Only one order of our precious Galbi per table per half hour or you're fired!" At lease that's how it felt. To top it off, there is a warning on the bottom of the menu that threatens a $25 penalty if more than a 1/2 lb of meat is left on your table. Seeing this warning was beyond ridiculous and ironic, as at no point was more than a 1/2 lb of meat served to us at any given time.

The service was typical LA / NYC, which means it was pretty much terrible and the waitresses will actually talk shit about you (in Korean) under their breaths. I saw & heard this several times, especially when we tried to manipulate the temperature of our grill. We had to get the attention of the manager (might have been the owner's wife?) to prod our waitress into filling our 6 empty beverage glasses and our empty banchan dishes. At one point we found a sweet spot by ordering with what appeared to be a servers' assistant: he brought us the 2 Galbi and 1 Whatever that we ordered a few times in a row and we felt like we hit the jackpot - sounds sad, doesn't it? In the end we ordered about 9 plates of assorted meats for an average of 3 servings per person at our table, or about 12 oz. per person. Grill off the fat and that's about 8 oz. of $5/lb. short rib plus some random banchan and soup for $25. Not a very good value, not to mention it took 3 hours to pry that much from them. This place makes Sura BBQ Buffet look like an oasis.

Quality of food and Woonam Jung retrospective: Almost exactly one year ago, this place opened with a full-price a la carte menu. The $28 single servings of Galbi were some of the most expensive in town, but absolutely the most tender, delicious Korean marinated short rib I've ever tasted. Worth every penny. This legendary Galbi DOES NOT exist anymore at Woonam Jung. Total bait and switch. Don't even think you're getting the same quality with the new (and stingy) AYCE plan. To make matters worse, the banchan they serve is below average, which is surprising because you'd think that it should be at least better than the stuff available at the Greenland Korean Market next door. I can't imagine that the owners of this restaurant actually eat the same grade food as their AYCE customers.

You guys are being cheapos: The vent hoods weren't turned up to an acceptable level, keeping our friends against the wall in a wall of smoke the entire meal. And, a table for 6 at a truly LA-style KBBQ should have a larger grill than the little circle ones at Woonam Jung. OK enough. 2 stars and I am out for good.Needing a food fix while walking through various casinos, we stopped here to check out the happy hour for a small nibble. We were drawn in by half price cheese slices, so we walked in and got a table. They also offer half price appetizers. We decided to start with one slice each, as they are pretty big. We also wanted to try the meatball appetizer. Upon placing our order, we are told that there is a minimum of two cheese slices per person...odd! Clearly the intention is to fill you up on cheap cheese pizza so you order less of the more expensive stuff. We didn't fall for that so one of us ordered two slices and had our one slice each. How was the food? Nothing terribly special unfortunately. The cheese pizza was super salty and the meatballs while good were generic and seemed about the same caliber as the frozen variety. Would we come here again to try the actual entrees?....no, there are far many better options in the same building even.Unfortunately nothing really special about the food here.Stayed here in March 2013. Maybe the remodel has things a bit confused. Hotel room was well decorated but it was not clean. There was a dirty wine glass in my room and another missing. The dirty wine glass had someone's lipstick on it. YUCK!! I also found a toenail in my bed. I called down about the glass and the employee called and said id have two new glasses ASAP. I mentioned the toenail and the rep said "wow, sorry that's so odd" Yeah..no kidding. That was all I got. I asked for feather pillows and I was told they didn't carry them. Fair enough, although odd for this kind of hotel. My last nights stay they came to replace my pillows with feather..hmm...Then there is the tub. It had jets, which I was looking forward to. What I wasn't expecting was that the jets were dirty as well. I turned them on and this green algae kept shooting out. After a few different tries to flush the stuff out I just gave up. Major let down. Upon speaking with the hotel staff at check out as well they did not really care. They just said "that's odd" and "I'm so sorry." I would have liked some compensation off of my hotel stay because it wasn't cheap, instead after writing a letter upon my return I got a response for a free upgrade if I stay there at a future date. Upgrade depending on the time of year etc special rules and restrictions apply. I have a year to use it, we'll see if I cash that in or just move on to a nicer more put together establishment.

I've traveled a lot over the years, and I think this was probably the worst hotel stay of my life to date, and that includes the time I got my stuff stolen by employees.eh its OK.

That was my thought going through the store the entire time. It just reminds me of a pricey H&M/Forever 21. Now being my favorite store is Free People I'm used to spending 100-150$ for a shirt but i couldn't really find anything here that was worth that. I'm very particular about the pieces I chose for my wardrobe that being said I don't think Ill be returning here anytime soon. I mean $75 for leggings? a little ridiculous if you ask me.Wanted to love this place. They did an OK job but the design wasn't what I wanted even after I tried to communicate it several times. I eventually gave up after it was already on my nails. He was gentle but hardly filed/shaped my nails. So some are rounded and some are squared. 

Also, the lotion he used smelled like men's deodorant.Stopped in to this place which lives lives in two small buildings for lunch today, joined by Robyn N. & Mike C.  Mike & I split a "Pig Mac" & a "Python Ripper".

The Pig Mac was a burger with 1/4 lb. of hamburger plus 1/4 lb. of pork sausage, plus lettuce, pickle, carmelized onion, & sauce.  It tasted good, but I liked it less than a similar sized burger at Smashburger, Five Guys or Fatburger.  ($7.25)

The Python hot dog ($8.75) was plain, but for the mustard you add yourself, & had a tasty but skinny snake weiner in it.  Ok, not just his weiner.     :-))

Seating was uncomfortable to me, sitting on a high, hard stool at a high table.

Service was friendly & prompt.

By the time it was over this cost just under $19, & both Mike & I were still hungry when we left, so even though the snake dog was an interesting treat this was a pretty weak experience overall & it's not a place I would return to.Yes I am changing my review.  I do like the atmosphere, and the decor.  The food can be great.
I was having incredible macaroni and cheese.  But something strange happened.  I guess the owner and staff bring their kids after school.  They really need to speak with their kids about speaking to guests-customers.  Yes if there is an emergency or problem let us know.  But their kids need to be controlled about what they say.
I needed to use the restroom.  There was a trash bag in between the two restrooms.  I wasn't sure which restroom was being worked on.  A little boy said in an authoritarian voice "There is an employee in there".  Okay I look again at the trash bag, both restrooms, at the child and up and down the hall.  Again the boy says "What are you looking for?"  So I go back to my table.  Later,  I try to use the restroom. By this time another child was sitting down with the little boy.  They were starring at me.  The boy said "Do we know you?"
All the boy had to say was "I think there is someone in there."  But this didn't happen.  I really don't want to deal with "Malcolm in the Middle". The owner needs to speak to the employees about their kids. Maybe the kids should have after school care or babysitters.The epitome of a dive bar! Not necessarily in a bad way, but only giving out two stars from my experience earlier this week. For starters, it was totally dead but took the one lone lady bartender a good five minutes to notice I'd walked in- because she was so engrossed in conversation with a patron. I guess it could be worse.

There's a large sunken seating area for watching games, and this bar has DirecTV- a plus in some ways, but considering that's what I have at home, this isn't a place to go to watch a game that's on the NBA or NFL package, they don't have that here from what the bartender told me.

They do have a food menu, and a Yelp check in offer saying you get a free drink with a food purchase- but the menu looked a little overpriced for bar food and I did not choose to try it at this time.
Lots of built-in poker machines built into the counter, most of the TVs are a little bit of an older style, signs up said they have karaoke on Thursdays but when I went it was completely dead- maybe I need to come back for those wings everyone's talking about.

Not sure when happy hour is- think I sign said their late one was 2AM to 5AM, but there's another one that ended at 5PM or 6PM. With normal pricing, our two small draft beers (Blue Moon and Shiner) were $8.*FIRST NOTE* We had a Groupon for this location. We had $20 to use. The owner told us that to use the Groupon, we had to each buy a drink and pay a 15% gratuity on the bill. The Fine Print on Groupon says nothing about having to buy drinks and adding a 15% gratuity. I know this guy was scamming us, but I paid the difference to just get this over with.

We ordered a beef shish kabob and a beef and lamb shwarma. The food took a little while to come out to us. The food was not bad at all. The beef shish kabob was actually pretty tasty. The shwarma had a bit too much gristle. The saffron rice was okay, nothing to write home about. Pita bread and hummus was good, didn't find it too oily, although I have heard complaints on that. The owner did even come by and give us extra pita bread. He also had us try the green sauce which wasn't too bad, it had a nice spice to it (though I had seen it earlier and commented that it looked old). The owner also mentioned that the beef was imported from some country like Australia and said it had no hormones. That I didn't believe, this coming from the owner who had already scammed us into buying drinks and gratuity. 

One good note from the owning scamming us to get drinks was trying the sour cherry iced tea. That was delicious. I'm not normally an iced tea drinker as I prefer more sugary drinks but this was a great blend of flavor and light taste. Definitely the best part of the experience.

Though, the place is only going to get two stars however. The fact that the owner scammed us into spending more money gives insight on how the whole operation is run. It's true, businesses that run Groupons do NOT make money of those. They actually are more likely to lose money in the short term as they are giving away food. The point of this is to increase foot traffic and get people in the door and have a nice experience so they can tell their friends. 

What the owner is doing is alienating the people who do use these deals. This may be acceptable in the short term, but in the long term, they will have very little repeat business.

Plus, this location had been on Dirty Dining only a month previously, where he mentioned that some of the meat is pre cooked (so why would he talk about the importation of great beef if it's imported?) and the green sauce in that episode had been out for 11 days. Just seems like the owner trying to talk his way out of things. 

I can understand where the owner is coming from. The strip mall where this restaurant is located is a dead zone. Nothing really survives in the space. The atmosphere around the location is abysmal and just down right spooky at time at how quiet it is. The inside of the actual restaurant is also like that, with the lack of patrons and the quietness of the music. 

Overall, the food wasn't bad and I would have been up for a return visit, but questionable tactics by ownership has really dampened any chance for that.Visited here a week after they opened. Cool atmosphere and loved the finishes inside the place. The server was friendly but it took us 50 minutes to get our two beers we ordered! The beer list is located at the back of the bar which was a little difficult to see honestly from all the tables.  I would say the food was just so-so and seemed greasy to me.  

We tried the spud tacos (a little blah and lacked a whole lot of flavor),  the avocado salad (which had greens that were extremely bitter and three small pieces of grapefruit) and the 810 sandwich (which had okay flavor but was greasy). In total, our dinner, took nearly two hours! Luckily I was not in a rush that evening or I would have been extremely frustrated. 

Hopefully they'll get the kinks worked out as they are open longer but I can't say I'll be going back.Highly overrated..... Everything in this buffet looks gorgeous, I can't argue that at all. I have never seen such a huge selection of foods at a buffet in my entire life. Everything looked wonderful and unique.... but nothing tasted that way. Everything was bland, the fish was NOT fresh, and not one thing impressed me. The chili and little tacos were probably the best things we had..... We were really disappointed. Everything was cold or melted by the time we got it back to our table. This buffet would be absolutely amazing if all of the various foods they served that look so great, were actually good.... It's not worth the price nor the hype, and it's definitely not worth the extra $25 when doing the buffet of buffets.... I would never go back here.We were driving back from Tucson and just wanted to pick up some Thai take out on our route.  I used yelp to find a restaurant with a good rating along the way.  

Thai Basil seemed to be a good choice so I called the order in.  We had the fresh rolls, Pad Thai and Sautéed Thai Basil Plate.

I was asked how hot to make the entrees out of mild, medium, hot and Thai hot.  I chose hot because we really do like a spicy dish.  

We eat a lot of Thai so the flavors and heat of typical Thai dishes are very familiar.

If we were to eat here again I would have the Thai Basil Plate.  It has a nice Thai basil flavor with a slight sweetness.  Fortunately we have eaten in a number of very good Thai restaurants on our visits to Phoenix and we will not return here.

Both of the entrees were really mild.  There was no heat at all.

The Pad Thai was just not good at all.  It just didn't have much flavor.

The fresh rolls had a good flavor but I would have preferred to have tofu or shrimp in them.  In addition to the typical vegetables they had a crunchy something that we could not identify and there is no description on the menu.I wish I could write a better review because I liked the staff and the convenience of this place in Vegas but unfortunately just painting nails is not their strong suit.
I got  a gel manicure and pedicure. I had paint all around my toe nail and the polish was so thick that it began peeling off in a day.
I had the same trouble with the gel manicure, the application was done so poorly that it only lasted a few days.I want to start off by saying that the participating restaurants weren't to blame for what was wrong with this event - the tacos were all delicious. My problem with the event was that it was extremely disorganized. 

It was damn near impossible to get a drink or to stand in the shade or to even get into the place. I tried not to hold a grudge on the line to get in, but holy hell. It was all enough to discourage me from coming back. If this was the first Taco Festival, I'd be more understanding. I'll bet the layout made total sense before they let people come inside. They need to check out a few Tempe Town Lake events to see how it's done.

There were several Valley events running concurrent with this one (like Tour de Fat)... Next year I may do something else. Overall though, I'm glad I went. I was able to sample some really tasty tacos. The offerings from Vitamin T, Cien Agaves, and Blanco's were excellent. We didn't have a single bad taco actually - can't recall every place we tried, but it was all good. 

I probably will go again at some point because I love tacos and I love to support good local restaurants, but I'm not in a hurry.Overpriced is an understatement.  I was here for work and my boss paid so money personally was no issue but if i'm going to pay 50 bucks for carne asada it better be the best i ever had. It had no flavor or seasoning of any kind other than some salt?  The beans tasted like el pollo loco pinto beans and were covered in water.  I can't even believe the cost of something that plain.  17 dollar margarita?  Yeah i know its not authentic and all that but if i can get better mexican food for a 6th the cost off an east oakland taco truck.  There's a problem. Service was good though and the aria is a nice place to stay.Met up with a friend here to have some drinks. The crowd was very sketchy. Lots of bikers and hoodlums. Was a hold on tight to your wallet tight type of place. Although I hear they have very good wings. Might have to hire a body guard and go check them out.Bf and I both ordered the tan tan men, which was delicious but overly rich.

We will not be returning because of the service. The karaage was supposed to come out as our appetizer, ended up coming out after our ramen (wtf?) and it wasn't even that good. Bf kindly asked the server if she could bring us edamame instead. She replied by saying "we'll sir, we already made this for you."

Ok. I work in a restaurant, I know that's not how you treat your guests. She ended up coming back to our table and asking if we wanted the karaage taken off the bill. Well obviously, we only ate one piece. 

Ugh. Shame on you, fukumimi.My husband and I had dinner here tonight, expecting something...more.  I had the trout, and he ordered the steak.  They both were good but just not as good as we had expected it to be.  Or maybe we've just had better.  My biggest complaint about both dishes is that it was surprisingly very lemon-y.  At first, I thought that since I had ordered fish, it must have been topped off with lemon juice because even my mashed potatoes tasted sour.  But my husband's entree was lemon-y too.  It was very bizarre.  Anyway, if we are going to pay around $20/person for fish and steak, I think we'll go somewhere else that uses less lemons in their dishes.I will have to go back and perhaps try a hook and ladder. I went for the first time and ordered the meatball. On the board it says that it includes Italian sausage but there was none on my sandwich. The service was good but I'm not convinced it was worth the price.My fiancé and I are locals and we visit the Aliante frequently. We were pleasantly surprised by the nice ambiance with live music and modern decor. However, we were never greeted when we walked in so we just chose a table in the bar area. We only ordered appetizers and drinks. The glassware smelled musty and was reused when we ordered the second round. The service was forgetful and unprofessional. The food WAS tasty, especially for the pricing, and arrived quickly after ordering (sometimes good and sometimes not). Although we enjoyed the food and ambiance, we most likely won't be coming back to Bistro 57.Stopped by this sports bar to get drink before the movies. I was very disappointed. The staff was nice, but very young and unknowledgable. I specifically requested to sit outside only if they could turn the misters on. I was seated outside and I had to request several times more before they would turn the misters on. It was not crowded, so did not understand the delay.
I ordered a very dirty gin martini with 3 olives. The waitress brought back straight gin in martini glass w/three olives. hello.....mc fly!! Then the waitress went MIA. So, I went up to the bar to address the bartender about my drink. The bartendar apologized and said that is what the waitress told her and she thought it was odd. None the less, the bartender remade me the correct drink.
I would recommend this place only if you order a beer and be very specific, cause their maybe a different interpretation.
Good luck!!I really wanted to like this place. I've held off on reviewing it, since I wanted to make sure that I really let the experience sink in, and not give them short shrift if I could help it. Alas, in the end, I did not find it to be good value. Now, to be fair, I did not try the golf; I only tried the laser tag. But, when having a party with your kids and their friends,  breaking them up into two groups to play laser tag doesn't make any sense. If the area is too small or you don't have enough weapons to cover them, don't offer packages for that many kids. Also, five minutes is NOT long enough to play; the other places we've been run 15 per game. The vests are chintzy and lacking the number of targets we've grown to expect at other places. The maze is too small. 

They don't make their own pizzas onsite. There's no soft drink fountain, so you have to pay per can. There's no chance of adding another pizza if the parents get hungrier than you expected; if you didn't order enough to start, you're SOL. 

The staff, however, is so earnestly nice, and they try SO hard to please, that you just really, really want to like the place. Sadly, in the end, the value is not there. They'd do better to tear out the laser tag portion, really focus on the mini golf until they have enough scratch to take over the place next door, and use that area to focus on laser tag, with better equipment.This is really the worst pub I have ever eaten at!  We should have left after looking at the menu, but I figured it really could not be that bad.  WOW was I wrong.

Fish & Chips; thick soggy batter with white mush inside for fish and Zero flavor.  The chips big huge block like sticks of greasy mush potato.

Brook Trout; a slab of fish with no flavor and root vegetables that tasted just like dirt.

So ok maybe the chef had a bad night, like he forgot his seasoning apron.  I could see a off night, but I can't  see horrible service.  Not in Vegas where ever casino has at least three great restaurant and five or so ok ones.  Our waitress or lack of one was awful she literally was never there.  I had to grab someone walking by every time we needed any thing drinks, bread, our order, and check.  Ok all that and a bus boy that spilled twice all over the table.  First time pouring water, he just kept pouring even after he had left the glass.  Second time picking up our plates, spilling what ever buttery watery juice came with the trout all over the table and my iPhone.  Each time he did this he never apologized or said a word.   Guess I can say, just don't go.  Go anywhere else, there are so many optionsI came here with my friends since this place had a pretty decent rating. FOOLED. If you're craving for good Vietnamese food, I suggest to go somewhere else. Soups were slightly warm, and flavorless. Glasses were empty the whole time; the service was very poor. Staffs were kind, and friendly, but the foods were just a huge disappointment.Okay, so the food was good. However, the service was bad!!!!!!! Well, the delivery portion. Our food was in horrible shape. I can't believe I tipped...don't get delivery unless you want your food completely smashed. It looked as though he drove through an EF 5 tornado before reaching our home.Went in over the weekend. It was nice to see a happy hour on the weekends good start. Got fried pickles. Loved them. Wanted tortilla soup got brought out beef stew with tortilla strips on top. It was gross. I have had a lot of tortilla soups and this wants even close to one. So I got A house salad.  Large bowl of nothing but lettuce. 2 tomato wedges 2 cucumber slices and 4 strands of onion. And the the Italian dressing was gross. I will not go back to eat but will drink there.Pluses:  Service, priced well for what they are attempting (attempting being the key word) clean, fun atmosphere.

Minuses: I had the burger with A1.  It was smothered in A1 overpowering.  Made the bun super soggy.  Burgers are well done,  no other option.  Only American cheese no other cheese choice.  Really?  Fries were unevenly cooked.  Some were still white others crispy-very inconsistent.Four of us went there to watch football. The games were on, but music was playing, so watching the game was not much fun. 

I had a $3 Sunday special bloody mary. Meh. Weak on the vodka, and the bloody mary mix just didn't taste right. 

Food: I had the "fall off the bone" pork ribs. Fall off the bone they did, but the reason why was that they were boiled to death, then browned in an oven and dunked in sauce. Was more like eating pot roast with bones in it. Awful. 

The onion rings were just so so, same for the chili mac & cheese. 

I guess the warning was evident when we walked in and the place was not very busy. 

Sorry...this is a "one and done" for me.Why oh why do they offer so many good shows here? This place is a nightmare!

First off, the parking is atrocious. Get here like an hour early if you want to avoid the rip-your-hair-out-run-people-over-cuss-a-lot frustration that comes with the freakishly long line of cars that starts a mile before you even get to Ak-Chin. There's got to be a better system for this.

Second...we saw a girl squat down and pee (yes, really) just outside of the pavilion. I don't think we are in Kansas anymore folks...it was disgusting to say the very least...not sure why no one stopped her.

The show itself was great and the weather cooperated fairly well...the seats a re a little close together, which can make for an awkward nice-to-meet-you-sorry-I-brushed-your-arm for the 25th time moment.

The food is a rip off, much like any concert venue. $4.50 for a bottle of water, $9+ for anything alcoholic and at least $8-12 for any type of snack.

We left during the band's last song and before the encore because I could foresee another I-want-to-slit-my-wrists getting out of the parking lot moment. I think we will be staying far away from Ak-Chin as much as possible unless there is a must see concert there.Second time staying at the HRH. Our "non-smoking" room had the strongest smoke scent when we entered. The room never felt CLEAN, the entire stay I was never confident as to how clean the room/floors were. The TV remote didn't work and there were no controls on the actual TV. Housekeeping would come in after knocking ONCE. Both times it happened, I told the lady that we would be leaving in 10 minutes and asked her to come back later -- both times, never happened.

I received an email about the $45 rate for the Wiz Khalifa concert. After changing my hotel accommodations to utilize this special, I was sorely disappointed upon check out and having $70 extra in "resort fees and room revenue." Ruined my entire experience. Truly...everything I have listed about the cleanliness of the room, etc. I was fine ignoring because EDC had just passed and I figured everyone was slammed with crazy guests and a lot of mess. But when I had to check out and found out the extra charges had occurred (and you're not even allowed to use the REFRIGERATOR for free! What is that?!), it definitely took all the little annoyances and made my stay regrettable. Won't be returning.

I did give it an extra star because the pool was nice, free and not too crowded with some music in the background.I did not stay here but saw a show and gambled. The casino is very dirty and the bathrooms are disgusting.  The bathroom looked liked a bus terminal bathroom, it was gross! I would not visit this establishment again. so disappointed..This is just one overhyped club...that will leave you disappointed. I've been there twice now and I don't think I will go back unless I book a table, which I doubt cause it's overpriced...by a lot. 

First time I went was free cause my girl won tickets for 5 to see Bingo Players and I guess it was fun then since we didn't have to wait in line. Drinks are pricey but on the same level as every other Tier 1 club in Vegas. I had a decent time as it was free.99

However, the layout almost strictly caters to tables as the whole club is littered with them. They spent all that money on this club and are hoping to recuperate the costs back with tables with exorbitant prices...I mean seriously, the club ain't no fun for general admissions. The dance floor is small, a bit bigger than Marquee's but that doesn't say much. There is no outdoor area...so you are trapped with no where to sit if you don't have a table. The hip-hop floor is cool though...so definitely check it out if you feeling some hip-hop.

Last Friday for Tiesto, my second time there, a bouncer kicked my girl out cause we were waiting for Tiesto and she rested her head on my chest. LIKE WTF? These fools have no idea what to do cause the entire night they were looking for people to kick out for no reason! They followed my homie around the whole night but he didn't do anything wrong so they didn't kick him out. They are pretty much useless ass bouncers with nothing better to do. I don't even know his name but he was a short scruffy looking white guy. Obviously must have some sort of Napoleon complex...but man, waste of money for my Tiesto ticket. Not like I missed much though cause I heard Tiesto was too drunk to DJ and messed up a lot. Yeah, I don't think he really likes the club himself.Ok! So the music was great!!! Had fun dancing the whole night, but unless you plan on getting bottle service then you won't be able to see the stage. Drinks are very expensive.Ok, really would give it more than 2 stars but not quite 3.  Went with my family and they all liked it fine.  I guess I am just a little picky.  We are happy that something finally opened up in this space.  Most of the customers are probably Sun Lakers...we were one of only 2 young'ish families there.  The decor was a bit blah... To be honest it reminded me of a place that Robert Irvine from Restaurant Impossible would be walking into for the "before" status.  It was clean, though.  For a Saturday afternoon lunch time, there was barely a crowd.  There was plenty of staff that didn't seem to have much to do...  The staff was friendly.  The service was fine.  I ordered a French Dip and onion rings.  It wasn't awful but it definitely wasn't the best I have ever had.  It was fine.. I ate it all.  Husband and daughter #1 had a burger.  They liked.  Daughter #2 had a BLT...she liked. They have a special going on where if you spend $30 you get a free pie.  We took home a peanut butter cup pie.  It was good..but again- nothing that I HAVE to go back for.  The lunch for 4 (only 2 of us ordered a soft drink) with tip came to around $40.  Not bad considering we got a free pie that is normally around $12.  So, overall it was just OK...Man, the amazing hand made Veggie Egg Rolls stuffed with cabbage, sprouts, and ginger in a nice thick wonton wrapper at the old Chop and Wok location have been replaced with frozen egg rolls out of a bag stuffed with mush.  I am so sad.  The old egg rolls were one of my favorite food items in the Valley.  I used to pick up bag fulls to take home and savor.  Today I bought 4 of them, but called it a day after eating one.  If you ever bring the old ones back Cop and Wok, I would be eternally grateful!

*This review is only for the veggie egg roles and not intended to reflect anything else the Chop and Wok offers.  The service today was also really good fwiw.Very unorganized. Kids teaching kids. Lacking any kinda structure. Dirty dirty deck. Parents & kids doing whatever, wherever. Noisy and save ur $ if ur looking for quality instruction. What a joke...synchronized swimming? Lol hang out on the deck on ur cell phone and chat with ur girlfriends for the first 40mins.Most expensive bowl of msg laced imitation pho I've ever tasted. The service and ambiance are good, but the pho, bun bo, mi quang are not so good. The broth has no flavor, and the noodles are very starchy. For $11-$13 a bowl, it'd be worth it to take a taxi to Pho So 1 in China Town for some real pho.This 3 star review comes from two vastly different experiences. The food was absolutely fabulous. I'd say the food was a 4 and half star. I absolutely loved it, but the service I recieved was horrendous. I walked in and the place was pretty busy, so I'm not going to hold it against them that I had to wait for someone to approach me and seat me. that was the start, I was essentially left alone for about 10 minutes until the waitress came and took my order, at which time she brought me the water I asked for the second I entered. My food was brought out to me, and not a word was said or even a look at me. It was almost as if se didn't want to be there and I was an annoyance. While eating, it took a superhuman effort to get the waitress' attention just to get a refill on the water. It wasn't very pleasant
The food, on the other hand was da B-O-M-B. I started off with the chicken wings and fish oil sauce, and needless to say it blew my socks off. The chicken was perfectly fried, and the sauce complemented it perfectly. In fact the only bad thing was that i burned my tongue because I'm too impatient to let it cool down. For my main appetizer, I decided not to get pho, but actually to try their broken rice because thats one of my favorite things. The pork was delicious and tender. I almost licked the plate clean is how good I loved it.
but in the end, as much as I loved the food, the service left a bad taste in my mouth. As someone who knows how restaurants work behind the  scenes, I tend to give a little more leeway for bad service because I know waiters get busy and they are generally doing what they can. This though, was a little too much. No check to make sure everything is fine with the food, not once did she ask me if i needed more water. I understand that she had other tables and large parties, but I am still a paying customer and I still would like to feel welcomed when I go out to eat. I'm very undecided on whether or not I'll return hereDeifintely not what I had expected after giving this place a 3rd try..... never was any better than the 1st or 2nd times..... burger was way over-cooked, green chili was weak, I have had better out of a jar from El Pinto that is True New Mexico Quality... supposed Fries were potato cubes fried and no flavor other than the oil they were sitting in on the plate...  3X times and still not any better..... hard to believe the Family is the same as the real New Mexico Los Dos Molinos... that at least is excellent real New Mexican food... I walked out the 2nd time with my wife and youngest child due to poor service as well....The servers are friendly, but a little aloof.  I understand that the restaurant is fairly new, but I felt like it was amateur hour.  One of the dishes did not come at the same time as everyone else's and they did not seemed concern until we asked about it.  

The food was okay.  I ordered the chicken adobo.  I liked the broth they used, it wasn't too salty and it was a little sweet.  However it was disappointing because the chicken was dry.  My sister ordered the fried chicken and that was pretty delicious.  It was tender and crispy.  If I ever go back I am probably just going to get the fried chicken.Tried it again today- so hot in there! It doesn't seem to be air conditioned, there are large fans but they are blowing hot air around. Very uncomfortable and my kids couldn't jump for their overpriced hour due to the heat.I really want to like this place. A few of my friends go fairly regularly and after seeing some of their FB posts I decided to give it a try. My first visit was lacking in service. I went again but had the same problem. Neither of the times I went were busy but my server (same for both times) was rarely available. She spent most of her time at the tables with large groups or in the back. During one of the visits I had to go to the counter to request utensils and condiments. I went back to my table and waited but they were never brought over. I wanted to order more but the server never made it back, so I just went up to the counter to pay my bill.

Service aside, the drinks and food were good and fairly priced. Some people complain about the drinks being too sweet but I actually prefer it that way. I'm hoping that as business increases they'll have more tables and more food offerings, including dessert.Two stars because they allow dogs. Great start.

It goes downhill from there. This place has a great location. A cool hip vibe.

And they can't stop tinkering with their service or menu. They had incredible salads. Then they downsized the portions. Then they changed the salads. Refills on their amazing iced tea were free - now they are $.50?? This was the final straw. Who the ---k wants to stand there and dog $.50 out of their bag. Or - oh better yet - let me run a $.50 charge on my credit card. 

I really hope they find something that works and stick with it. Key word is works because it's so obvious there is some knucklehead partner investing here who should not be involved. That's all I can think. Because they have everything - dog friendly, great patio, cool interior - and somehow they are ---k--g it up?

You know the worst part? I was so annoyed by the refill price, I stopped to yelp. Now I'm late for the dog groomers. Thanks, Altitude.Love, love the idea of choosing your own toppings and creating a custom pizza pie!The pizza was pretty good, too.  This would have gotten at least 4 stars had it not been for the fly that was buzzing around the raw ingredients in the open containers.  It was allowed to roam free the entire time I was there.  Then there was this gal with a bandana behind the counter who was constantly talking on her phone and I can't help but think about her spit getting on the food.  When they sliced the pizza, they did not use gloves and the same chatty gal was the one slicing after pulling out her phone time and again to talk on it.  The tables can use a wipe down or two but seems like the employees were either too busy taking calls on personal phones or chatting amongst themselves to keep the place tidier.  Too bad.  Would have liked to go back.  May try other locations.Feels a bit sparse in selection in comparison to the one in Boston. Zaras are always such a hit or miss, and this one was definitely a miss. The selection seemed a bit "old" rather than trendy.So sad!  We had such high hopes for this place.  We eat out a lot (in fact we are trying a new restaurant every day this winter break!)  This restaurant cannot compete with anything else nearby.  Maggiano's -fabulous, Brio - lovely, Buddy V's -meh.  We had the meatball sand and the vodka sauce pasta.  Both were bland, small and overpriced ($23 for a very small plate of pasta.). No hot bread and butter, no attentive wait staff, no one asked how are meals were, we were invisible.  Then we come to the real reason we went - the lobster tail pastry.  At $15 we were sure it would be crazy good.  It wasn't. The cream inside was luscious and the presentation was beautiful, but the pastry itself was so hard and overcooked we couldn't cut it and that made sharing difficult.  Worst of all, I left my commemorative photo of my little girl and I from  the National Geographic exhibit on the table.  When we realized this 2 hours later we rushed back to the restaurant.  They had thrown it out!  Who doesn't keep people's forgotten things for at least the rest of the day?!  A very bad $64 lunch and a sad tale to tell.The latte was good.  The double Espresso was terrible.  It was 3 times the quantity of a normal double Espresso and very bitter.  It also was loaded with coffee grounds in the bottom of the cup.  When questioned, the reply was that they were having problems with their Espresso machine.  No offer to compensate. No heads up prior to placing the order.our waiter was very nice and patient. there were 4 of us and being first timers, had lots of questions. 

the burgers were good but they werent great. we ordered medium rare but came over cooked. we all prefer some of the other burger places in town. 
sweet potato fries were disappointing as I read a yelp review recommending them... the onion rings were good but again, not great. fried calamari was okay. Brussel sprouts were good but you better like spicy or dont waist your time. 
unfortunately, we won't be coming back.Oh how I wish I could give more. I love tropical smoothie but I may have to rethink this location. I walked into the store and only one other customer was there. They were having some sort of malfunction with the registrar so thy were writing orders down by hand, no big deal. I ordered a buffalo chicken wrap with no tomatoes (yum!) I sat done at a table unable to pay and waited to see what the process would be. One worker was on the phone trying to fix the phone while another made the smoothies and the third just trolled around unsure what to do. The unsure one brought me my smoothie and some post it notes where he asked for my card to write down the number. I was not super keen on the idea but understood they need my money some way another. He wrote down all my info and then they got the machines working. He began to ring up my order which came out to double them amount, thank goodness I didn't end up blind sided by the charge later. I explained to him how the meals work and he then lowered the price. I asked for the paper with my card back, just to be safe. After all that I got my wrap where he just then realized he put tomatoes on it because he " forgot to read the note". Unfortunately for his excuse it was lousy considering he was the one that took the note. I said it was ok and wanted to be on my way because I was real ready to go by then. All in all I think it's best if these workers have some sort of management around.


Update, just got home to eat my food and it taste terrible. And not just because of the tomatoes!not very good period. took them about 15 min to get hot tea and I had to tell about 3 servers. what sushi place takes 15 min to get hot tea??? they didn't even bring the garlic edamame I ordered. the nigiri is a shame. they cut the fish so small and thin. I ordered spicy tuna poke salad. it had ONE piece of fish in it. the only reason I didn't give it 1 star is that the place was clean. I would never go back here again and would tell everyone to avoid at all cost. there too many better ayce sushi places in town.We saw a great review in the  republic recently and decided to hAve our anniversary dinner here.  A big mistake!  it is expensive and the food is not good.  we ordered patron silver margaritas for $22 and they had no mix at all - just ice and tequila.  A watered down drink that I should have sent back.  it was the worst margarita I have ever had.  We could not have the happy hour price on our appetizer because we chose to sit in the restaurant section for dinner afterward instead of the bar.  This makes no sense to me because we were just a few feet away.  We ordered the soft rib eye tacos and guacamole.  The tacos were awful and full of gristle.  The guacamole was good and the salsa and chips excellent.  Service was very slow.  We ate two baskets of chips waiting for our dinner so needless to say we took half home.  Our entrees were the pork carnitas and seafood crepes.  The crepes were very good and the pork not so much - very bland with little flavor.  The rice side had been reheated many times and not fresh and was also bland.  The mixed veggie side was very good.  We sat near the patio doors and froze because they would not keep the doors shut.  Our server tried but could not answer even the simplest questions and ran off to ask someone else.  The ambience is good and so is the location but we will not be going back.  Our bill was $100 and for this amount it should have been better.Had vegeterian pho...was good...but when I called to place order, I asked if all the sauces would be in bag w ingredients and was told yes. There was no sir racha !  I also ordered a veggie spring roll, asked if it was like the ones at rice paper, their sister restaurant, and again told yes. No...it was basically lettuce sprouts and asparagus and no vermicelli noodles at all! Hands down rice paper downtown is the best!!! Very cute interior though at slanted rice...I will try it our for dinner.Went to this place twice. Both times the meat was it extremely dry. Some of the chopped brisket was drier than beef jerky.Stopped in for lunch during their opening week. Whoa, not sure I've ever seen (or thought possible) a sandwich place to be so busy. Waited patiently in line to order, got the turkey artichoke I believe, on focaccia and also the tomato soup.  I got VERY lucky and snagged a table that was still dirty but since it was the only one in the entire place I didn't care.

I got the food quicker than I expected considering how busy it was.  The sandwich had good flavor, but I wish there was more to it.  It was more bread than anything else.  The chips that came with it, or that were supposed to come with it, were just crumbs mixed with cheese.  I wondered if this is what they were supposed to be like, but looked around and saw people eating actual chips so I figured I just got the bag of crumbs at the bottom of the barrel. :(  Also the soup was just OK.

I loved the little retail section which has a lot of cute, unique items for sale (which could be dangerous while waiting for your food!).

The service was friendly, and I think I will give them another chance in hopes that they just need to work out some kinks after the initial opening.I was pretty excited to fund out the Rio had a hash house a go go. I've been to the one in San Diego was and was blown away by how amazing it was. The portions were huge and the food tasted great. This one however brings shame to the hash house name. 

First off the ambiance of the restaurant is fine. A standard restaurant located in a casino at the Rio. The service here was also decent...no complaints there. The food however was disappointing to say the least. I ordered the corn beef hash which was moderately priced for Vegas food. The plate came out with an unpleasant liquid along the bottom of it and it just got soaked into the potatoes. The corn beef had as much flavor as a piece of cotton. It was terrible. By far the worst corn beef I've ever had. The biscuits looked appetizing. But again....WRONG...DRYEST BUSCUIT EVER and just not enjoyable at all. 

I still love the one in SD. But never coming back to this one. For sure.This place had little selection. I was excited there was an asian market that opened right next to my place. However, when I checked it out cause I needed some last minute vegetables for the sinigang I was going to make I noticed that the vegetables they had were basically rotting already. The sitaw (chinese long beans) I was going to buy there had brown spots all over them already and were definitely over priced. I can see that they had all the canned filipino foods people may need to make some filipino dishes which is a good thing. But I think this place definitely needs more products in order to really blossom. This store has potential to explode but not with the little selection of vegetables and filipino foods they have. It is at a convenient place right next to Mountain's Edge neighborhood, but they need to defintely up their products.So I'm visiting from LA, a vegetarian athlete...so when I saw salads with the option of adding veggie gardein chicken, I got super excited!! What I got was 90% romaine lettuce, very little other ingredients and four or five pieces of chicken. Flavor fail, salad fail.Wayy too overprice for the portion you get! Some of my friends had more lobster meat than others. Not fair lol. Plus service looked a bit confused even with our numbers at our table. 

I wouldn't come back to eat here.
