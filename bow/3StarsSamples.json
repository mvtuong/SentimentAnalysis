Hot and Sour Soup. Not for the weak of heart, but phenomenal. Oh and the House Dynamite is also a great spicy dish with a touch of sweetness.

Fate is amazing, and I love that CenPho is getting cute cozy little restaurants popping up everywhere, but...the service at Fate sucks. The girls are unfriendly (not rude, but not open or approachable). The last time I went there was in the winter and they forced us to sit on the open patio. It never gets that cold in Phoenix, but it was night time and I froze and I finally was able to get the girl to close the sliding door (after asking her twice). They definitely need to learn how to be more accomodating to their guests.
Oh and forget trying to go there on First Fridays...It's MADNESS.We get lunch at my office well, pretty much everyday. We usually stick to the reg spots, but one of the girls wanted to try this place. 

I had the Greek Pita w/ the pasta salad. It was pretty big but a little difficult to eat. Especially at your desk! I have to say though the pasta salad wasn't as great as I'd hoped. My coworker raves about the slaw. I hate it, so I couldn't tell ya, but I'd take her word... Take out was a little slow, but overall, for the price and what you got, I'd say it was worth. Good place to go for a quick lunch.I was sort of expecting more from this. The food is decidedly average sports bar food, not really anything special. Plus, the side dishes are weird. Mandarin Oranges and apple slices don't really belong next to a burger, in my opinion. Still, it was a good enough meal, the waitress was super friendly and I highly recommend the Michael Buble drink, just drink with caution, it's strong!While waiting for my car to be repaired at The Auto Shop (we had an hour to spare), I thought I'd treat Mom and myself to a proper breakfast at Matt's Big Breakfast (I've only had lunch there once), but after seeing the long line of people waiting to get in, I decided we'd try lunch at AE, instead- it came with glowing recommendations from TAS's manager (this resto is just across the road from the shop, which is very convenient for the employees here).  

Bare accommodations- cafeteria-style tables and chairs, TVs, window counter seating.  Help-yourself complimentary coffee and tea counter, with shakers of Splenda available to those inclined to use them- nice touches!  Their breakfast menu sounded very tempting, but the man behind the counter told me that the delivery guy with the eggs wouldn't be in for another 10 minutes or so (Feta omelette, anyone?).  I decided we'd try the Friday fish special of grilled tilapia over salad and a gyro pita with a side salad, extra feta.  I did not enjoy eating the tilapia as it would magically crumble into tiny pieces the moment I cut it with a fork or a knife.  Very annoying!  Besides this, the whole dish tasted very bland since I opted to forgo the housemade vinaigrette (contained allergens); Thankfully, the extra feta (LOVE feta!) salvaged the dish and I was able to down the fish even without the use of a spoon, of which I was constantly wishing would be on hand.  The gyro pita was a much tastier experience, although Mom did not like the meat.  Truth be told, this could not compare with the meat in the gyro dinner I just had a few nights before at MBFGR, but for the price (around $6), it made for a quick and satisfying lunch (and the extra feta in the pita didn't hurt, either)!  While the gyro is not made in-house, AE does have it shipped in three times a week from Chicago, so I was told by the man behind the counter.

Baklava looked awesome, but I couldn't try it since it contained an allergen, but no worries since any item offered here would be fulfiiling enough!Descent fish tacos but their ceviche had fake lime juice( the bottled kind) those were only okArcadia Cove is a very nice place because the grounds are well kept, the buildings are modern and the apartments are spacious.  Though it is well maintained, it is not well managed.  They should change their names to Arcadia STOLE. I lived there for two years and I have experienced nothing but being nickeled and dimed to death regarding my lease. Every so often I'd get a letter on the door about an incorrection or price jump on my lease.  And this is after signing a year lease.  If you want to live there you have to ask specific questions about the lease.  I have asked questions but their explanations might as well have been in French. 

For example, one of the many times, I got a letter giving me a credit for some shady reason and the very next month they took it back for some other shady reason.  Their reasons are never clear.  And then before I moved they sent a letter stating that I needed to vacate the premises no later than March 30th even though I knew my lease ended on the 31st.  So, I followed directions and turned in my keys on the 30th.  When I got my "security deposit" explanation back, I noticed that I was charged $26 for leaving the apartment a day early. 

I called and the customer service manager, Aaron, was a hair short of being completely rude on the phone.  And this is a man whom I've chit chat with in his office for an hour one time.  He told me that I did not honor my lease and I reminded him that someone in his office post that letter to my door and I'm being penalized for his/her mistake.  He corrected me by saying, "you're not being penalized, you're being charged." Say what? Then he proceeded by adding, "even if you were to take it to court, all the judge would see is that you didn't honor your lease." 

By the way, after they nickeled and dimed my security deposit, I got $12 back.  If you want to live there, don't just lock your door, lock your wallet too.My boyfriend and I ate here yesterday after attending church for some friends.  We typically have only gone to the location in Scottsdale on Thunderbird but since we were in Central Phoenix we decided to try this location.  Food was decent but service was pretty bad.  I asked for pancakes with my meal, waitress brought potatoes.  Coffee was lukewarm at best.  We had to ask for a pitcher of water.  My boyfriend asked for a to go cup for his soda but she brought him a to go box instead.  It seemed as if she was ready to leave as it was towards the end of their day.  I think we'll stay with our normal location as they seem to have the service down to a fine art.Menu isn't very appealing, however the food is delicious.  Had the Cesar salad and soup, very good. Husband had the shrimp slider which were very good. Service is very chill, kinda a small place but VERY clean.For a nondescript, strip mall of a location Christo's pours on the charm of old Italian flare.
For our family thanksgiving, we all decided to celebrate my birthday, parents anniversary, sister's birthday and realtor's birthday all in one shot; nice treat was this place is around the corner from my sisters house.
We ordered a bevy of dishes and i got the lamb shank. The chicken soup and salad that comes with the meal is a nice treat and the creme brulee dessert is especially good.
The food is good but not outstanding.
For next year family gathering, I hope we get to explore more of the cuisine of the local hood.I really like the classes. The instructors really seem well-versed. But, they are so jam-packed. I hate that. Also, one time the instructor introduced herself to all the other yoga newbies but, completely ignored me. Maybe, I rubbed her the wrong way,I don't know. Whateves. Also, the Mommy and Me yoga is so overrated. I think I just did not really mesh well with Evon. But, I do love the front desk help especially the guy who teaches restorative.CPK is fun.  The parking is a challenge unless you want to walk a bit or wait a bit. I like the pizzas and the service is always good.I want to try EVERYTHING on the menu!!! But it's hard to do because the portions are so HUGE on everything.

I usually go with a sandwich with slaw. The coleslaw has a nice sweetness to it, but tends to be on the soggy side. The sandwiches are usually packed with meat. GREAT place for liverwurst.

This is a cafeteria-style place, so you can clearly see how fresh everything is. But the place is usually packed for lunch, so they cycle through everything relatively quickly.

The employees are always friendly and the place is always CLEAN!!! Whoever is doing the hiring there is doing an amazing job.I eat here or order in whenever I visit my family who live out in Phoenix.  They have tasty American food, competent staff and a great selection of alcohol for beer or wine lovers.  Their steak sandwich is excellent as is their ceasar salad and fries.
 I would say their only downsides are that their prices felt a bit high for the portions that they offer and the dining atmosphere is only okay.  But, if you want a good American meal eat here, you won't be disappointed.I could live in the housewares section of this Ross. I keep wanting to go back, hoping they get the Chef Basket. I swear out of everything I've ever wanted to buy on TV I've never wanted anything more than 2 Chef Baskets plus a Forever Sharp Knife for $14.99 plus shipping and handling.  I realize that I've said that same sentence about Space Bags, Magic Bullets, Slap Chops, and ShamWowws, but this time I really mean it. The thing is, after you see those things and wait a few months, Ross usually has them for cheaper and NO shipping and handling (though you do have to pay the substantial personal fee of being surrounded by unsupervised children during your shopping trip, so maybe S&H is worth it).

This particular Ross is right next to a Target. If you have a specific item you need to buy in housewares, ALWAYS GO TO ROSS FIRST. I made the mistake of going to Target once for champagne flutes, one of those fancy wire egg slicers, and two ramekins and ended up spending about double what I would have spent at Ross, which I stupidly went to second.

My other go-to Ross department is shoes. You can find some ridiculously marked down (like more than Marshall's or TJ Maxx) Steve Maddens, Jessica Simpsons, and Nine Wests here. They are usually last season and run about $30 for the more high-end brands, though I'm no stranger to picking up a pair of Joey O pumps for $12.99. I've never even heard of that brand before, but they fit my feet really well and are SUPER cheap at Ross. Another word for the wise:  Check all the shoe sizes, not just your own. Bitches hide shit. But seriously, if I have to tell you this, odds are you've never stepped foot in a discount store in your life and probably won't go to this Ross ever, so I suppose that's irrelevant.

Despite the bratty kids and somewhat cluttered appearance, Ross is good for select things (housewares, shoes, workout clothes) at a good price. Head in often, because you never know what they just got. Give me a call if you see the Chef Basket.I'm a cupcake connoisseur.  I truly believe they are one of the best treats one can have.

When I travel (which is often), I find myself compelled to look for the best cupcake that city has to offer. After scouring Yelp!, I found Tammie Coe. It looked promising, but I found it odd that two locations so relatively close to one another differed in ratings and reviews as drastically as they did. So, I decided it was my civic (and culinary) duty to try cupcakes at both.

This location has Red Velvet, Ooey Gooey and Coconut available.  I opted against trying the latter because I'm just not a coconut fan.

Ooey Gooey -- One thing I enjoy about this cupcake is how jovial it is.  It is pure joy in small cake form.  They come covered in sugar crystals -- in a variety of colors!  This cupcake looked better than it tasted, sadly.  Now, it was good.  But it wasn't amazing.  The chocolate cake was a bit dry and the icing was somewhat pedestrian.  Perhaps I've become too much of a cupcake snob, but I sincerely cannot tell a lie -- when it comes to cupcakes!  Truth be told, I feel this cupcake suffered from being a tad too old -- and kept it far too cold of an environment.

Red Velvet -- This is the cupcake I use as my way to judge all bakers.  This cupcake is a classic.  Now, Tammie puts a spin on this classic that is extremely unique.  Their red velvet is not made with traditional southern chocolate.  It seems they use a vanilla based cake for their red velvet.  While I'm not sure that constitutes this cupcake to be called a red velvet any longer, I will say -- WHO CARES!  Their red velvet in a sweet, vanilla cake with a vanilla cream cheese frosting that is coated in red sugar crystals.  It was moist, flavorful, not overly sweet.  It is a very fine cupcake. Not the best I've had -- but it is up there and deserves praise.

One thing I'd like to point out is that unless you order ahead, you need to buy your cupcakes at La Grange Orange Grocery (or LGO as the locals call it).  The service there was wonderful.  They even let me pick whatever color ooey gooey I wanted.  That being said, when we walked into Tammie Coe (not knowing we had to buy from LGO), we were treated fairly -- cold.  The woman in the bakery looked at us as though we didn't get the memo.  She spoke to us with great disdain and sent us packing.  It really put me off -- but, I try to just judge the food.  And since you don't need to deal with that bakery to eat their cupcakes, I'll just thank my lucky stars!Would have given 3.5 stars but I just couldn't bring myself to do a 4-star review on this place.

I've been getting takeout from here for a few years and at first would rate them a 5* for service, quality and food. Now, they've dropped in all those categories. 

Used to be, you would call in your order and they would make it for you on the spot. It would be ready for pickup within 10-15 minutes or so, and their special parking for curbside pickup was super convenient. Food was fresh and delicious (my fave is the Evil Princess Thai Salad). 

NOW it's certainly not the experience it used to be. Here's what happened today when I ordered lunch - what has happened every time I've ordered in the past 6-9 months or so....

I call in my order (EPT Salad with extra peanuts) and the girl on the phone says "We don't have any salads made yet." Ummmm... so, why not just go ahead and make one? BECAUSE they don't do made-to-order salads anymore. I am asked to wait 30 minutes because by that time all the EPT salads will be done. Even though this is an inconvenience (and pretty ridiculous really) I am willing to wait. She confirms my order and I remind her... extra peanuts please.

(Oh and BTW my associate's Pizzeria Chop Salad is ready anytime- so is that from yesterday then?)

And despite requesting extra peanuts from all three people at LGO I've dealt with today (including the girl bringing out my order) - no extra peanuts. *sigh*

My coworkers and I used to order from them weekly. So now instead every 4-5 months i hope to give them another chance but am just disappointed every time. 

PS - they no longer carry Tammy Coe cupcakes (which are heavenly), even though the bakery is literally 3 doors down from them. They have subbed them with their own (again mediocre) baked items.Time to share some opinions here that the majority might not agree with...

Sandra Bullock is a horrible actress

High School was NOT the best time of my life

Postino Winecafe does not live up to the hype

...while I write this, I of course realize that most people sadly somehow enjoy Sandra Bullock films, think High School was a blast, and...at least according to the reviews on Yelp, adore Postino Winecafe. 

The food is decent enough...bruschetta was flavorful (although on our last visit the bread was a little hard) and the Pub Board appetizer is amazing. The main gripe we have with this place is the service. Do you have to spend a lot of money on alcohol or look like a hipster here to get good service or what? We went for a light meal...nothing more. I don't see a sign on the door that says 'must buy wine', so why did our waiter treat us like a couple of vagrants while he was overly friendly to tables around us who were spending more money? I get it...higher bill, higher tip...this is no excuse for bad service though. A paying customer is a paying customer. The disparity in service couldn't have been more painfully obvious, and that's a shame. Maybe we went on an off night...or maybe Postino is getting cocky...who knows?

We had a decent meal, but left feeling like outsiders instead of valued guests. Maybe next time if I wear a 'deep V-neck' and Katrina wears some 'jeggings', we'll appear wealthier and get better service. Eh.

3.25/5.I have been able to experience both lunch and breakfast at Taylor's Cafe and on both occasions, both service and food were decent. The restaurant is tucked between some small clothing shops, The Eggery, and next to AJ's. The parking is not desirable especially during the lunch hour as the restaurant is sharing the lot with three restaurants and the grocery store.

The restaurant is small with few small tables, shared booth seating, and some outdoor seating. The decor is bright with exaggerated art work of Jazz performers. Apparently, the restaurant used to have some live Jazz music in the past. It is a very cute place.

For lunch, I had one of the chicken sandwiches which was good. However, I thought the options for breakfast were better. You could either choose one of the specialty omelets or build your own. I had the lox omelet which was excellent with hash browns. I was interested in the country potatoes however the waiter had mentioned that other tables had sent back the potatoes and that the hash browns would be better. Still unsure, he let us sample the country potatoes which were decent. I actually liked the country potatoes over the hash browns, I thought it was nice that the server was interested in making sure that we were satisfied. And overall, we all were. My guest ordered a build your own omelet with chorizo and another guest ordered the waffle with fresh fruit and both looked good and were highly complimented. The server was open to providing separate checks (however I am not sure that he would have been so willing if the place was packed which it wasn't). There was a random To-go iced tea delivered to our table and our check had originally not charged for our coffees but then after separation, had charged. These few incidents of confusion were masked by the overall pleasant service, atmosphere and quality of the food. I will definitely be back and would recommend Taylor's as a great breakfast/brunch location.I had lunch here yesterday since Wally's was closed due to some water problems. I thought the restaurant was spacious and inviting. The tables were comfortably far apart from our neighboors. A nice place to have a meal and chill.

I had the make your own omlette which consisted of cheese, ham, onions and greenpeppers (a Denver Omlette) along with country potatoes. The country potatoes were terrible and overcooked. The omelette was ok, not near the top of the list. My friend enjoyed his waffle, he liked that there was a lot of fruit to cover the waffle.

Our bill was about $30 for lunch.The food tastes good. Unfortunately I had forgotten that my stomach wasn't doing too well.  I had originally posted that I had gotten sick from the food but this is my post edited. I simply did not put two and two together.

The service was great, by the way and in the future I need to be careful when I have a pre -existing digestive bug.Good Mexico City food but sometimes the service is suspect. 
Nice to find a menu that isn't just the played out typical standards the margies can be fantastic. 
So if you want your atypical fare this is the place but make sure your schedule is freed up for an hour or so.Sorry, but I'm just not a huge fan. My co-workers seemed to like it and they get pretty good reviews, so maybe it was just an off day for them. The beans were pretty good since they had bacon in them, but there were lima beans in them too. Yuck!I do simple reviews after having BBQ in 49 states...  :)

Pork: Great
Chicken: Great
Beef: Good
Ribs: Awesome
Beans: Awesome - Strangely similar to what you get at Joe's in Gilbert...  Hmmm....
Slaw: Meh.  I'm not a fan of the large chunks of cabbage.  I like mine shredded better.

The seating is very limited and the line gets long around noon (out the door long).  

It's best to get it to go.Not a bad airport. It is long so if you somehow need to ghetto th opposite end in a short time, you will want to book it. A shuttle will take you to and from the rental car area. The area with rental cars us kind of large.A plain airport, but in the middle of boulders I didn't expect much. 

Breakfast was $10 for one large taco and service with a smile. 

I noticed the areas in each terminal have a kid friendly section: cartoon channels, child size seating, and soft play areas. In all of my airport stops, I've never seen anything like that.Extremely pricy for the experience.  In a down economy I have no idea how a 15min race for two can go for $55.  The video games seemed very outdated.

Yes, the race it self was fun.  The establishment was a bit empty, I'm guessing due to prices.  Maybe more for your buck here would make it a reasonable place to enjoy with friends.I give this place a 3.5. I went here a bit ago for reverse happy hour. I had gone to RA on Mill Ave once, a looong time ago. I remember thinking it was good before, but I think it's just cause I was not so widely exposed to sushi and plus, the ambience - being on Mill, with friends, during college, and the beginning of a night out - was what made it fun. So, going to this location was all right. The sushi was decent, nothing too special. I did however enjoy the drinks. They had the ingredients available to make my drink, a Geisha Flower. And surprisingly, other sushi joints don't have some ingredients so that's what made, hence the 3.5 and not just a 3.The sandwiches were made to order, the aroma of the food cooking on the hot grill teasing my nostrils, this place is legit.

You get to choose most of the sandwiches from Small, Medium, and Large.  I ordered Mediums, thinking of Subway ... but the sandwiches were much bigger.  They say the medium is 12" long, but they seem longer than subways 12" (hey, no laughing)

Ordered several sandwiches:
Capastrami
Cran-Slam Club
Chicken Cheese Steak
Homemade Meatball Sub

Demanding a bite of each, the two that I liked a lot were the Capastrami & the Cran-Slam Club.  The Capastrami had thick tender slices of hot pastrami that was full of flavor, had a nice pink color, and wasn't dripping with oil (like some places).  The Cran-Slam club had fresh slow-roasted Turkey that was super moist and delicate, not dry and brittle.

I heard that they will be opening locations near my house which is good.  Once that happens, I won't be as jealous about my cousins living so close to this location.I sometimes go here. But I haven't been here since I've had my baby. Well I went there today and realized that the carts are plastic now and completely unsafe to put my baby in because if he even leaned forward in the seat it would collapse on top of him. I couldn't even get the cart protector over the cart without it collapsing. It's very dangerous for the the consumer. I refuse to go here now. I hope I'm wrong about the carts...but they didn't work for me.Kind of expensive for the quality of food you get here.  The oyako don I ordered came in a very elegant Japanese-style presentation, but when I tasted it, the sauce was very sweet which distracted from the other flavors from the ingredients.  The soda was a bit flat, and it was a bit eerie eating here as the only patrons at 7:00 PM on a Friday night.I had the steak burrito.  This is traditional Mexican versus the lighter and healthier CaMex - re-fried, heavy on cheese, very few greens.  The table chips and salsa includes re-fried beans.  Very friendly and courteous staff.  Seated promptly, food came out quick and hot, and no eating for refill of ice tea and check delivered promptly.  That is a lot of pluses on the service side.  4 stars if the burrito came heavier in greens and lighter on cheese and refried.I took in three or four plastic grocery bags of cans at the end of  my last trip here and got about a dollar.  This trip I had about twice to three times that much, two kitchen trash bags full.  It still came to only $1.80 for three pounds.  At least it wasn't far to drive here, but still hard to justify the energy saving them other than the reward of knowing I was recycling.  

I saw pickup trucks loaded with metals lined up going in a different entrance and the guy ahead of me inside the office got over $50, so I guess it's worth it if you have enough pounds of scrap metal.It's just a Denny's, nothing special, but....

Fast, friendly service, unlike may other Denny's I've visited.

Consistent food quality. I know what will be coming out of the kitchen when I order a meal at this Denny's. The Chicken fried steak is decent, so is the Buffalo chicken sandwich.

...and hey... I find them to be WAY better than the IHOP at Alma School & ElliotPretty standard.I've never had dim sum before but we've been here a few times. The food is good, tasty, and average. The bready things with meat or custard are awesome and some of the shrimps are good, too. I've never had a problem getting served here or missing carts. This is definitely a place to go with friends or a group so you can split up the bill.If you want good sushi and don't care about awkwardly bad service and an overly egocentric sushi chef, this is your place.

This is a TINY place in a strip mall in Chandler.  I didn't even SEE it until I turned back around, and I can't even give you a good marker by which to find it, except to tell you it's NOT where any major drugstores/gas stations are.

The place is adorable.  It probably seats 40 people max if they smush.  Cozy booths and what looks like a great posh large 10 person area in the back is perfect for meeting friends for sushi or throwing a small birthday party.

Our waiter was the most adorable nice man...with a horrible memory.  We ordered 2 seaweed salads: forget them both, then brought one, then we reminded him we got 2--this took 20 minutes just for the first reminder.  We ordered 6 pieces of sushi, 4 showed up...I mean, if i didn't feel like a super friendly great-uncle was serving me and the environment wasn't so great, I think I would have been irritated.  The whole place just calms you down with the environment, plus I was catching up with an old friend.

Our sushi chef left the sushi bar and was talking to one of the other tables for the LONGEST time...we had to roll our eyes because he was bragging about himself so much.  I mean, dude, your food was good, but that doesn't mean you can stop making it while people are still hungry!!!

I felt so bad, and they felt worse--they comped our salads.  Seriously though, the rolls were PHENOM and the sushi was top notch.  Just go when you're meeting a long-lost something or someone you really haven't seen in a while...otherwise, you may not enjoy the experience as much as I did.The hair that was baked into my muffin was not as delicious as some may believe. Watch for hairs before you bite into your muffin. ;) Luckily the service, especially the guy at the register(Oliver), were really nice and made the experience better.Food was good, service was not as I expected, and felt very crowded due to the small area.I prefer "All About Tennis" but SA gets a thumbs up for having a decent selection of Tennis-related gear, having wide-size tennis shoes in stock, XL size socks (these are shockingly hard to find), plus it's really close to home and the club.Yep - our bachelorette party went to two Devil's Martini's in one night.  We wanted to end our night more up north in Scottsdale, so we headed here around midnight.  

Here's the thing.  We were a group of 8 girls - all good looking, dressed up and at our target weight.  It's my bachelorette party, so you know we were ready to have a good time.  However, upon arrival AFTER MIDNIGHT, we were told everyone had to pay $5 cover.  Huh?  But....can't you see.....we're..........GIRLS? 

So my BFF had to give the bouncer a talkin' to and she got us in without the cover and we danced our asses off and had a good time but still.  We're GIRLS!  Puh-leese.....no cover!!When it comes to sushi my eyes are ALWAYS bigger than my stomach and I just can't seem to avoid spending a tiny fortune, drats!

I hadn't been to Ra in a severely long time and was pleasantly surprised and wonderfully satisfied upon this recent re-visit!

Items we ordered that I care enough to remember and am salivating at the memory are: 
Beef Tataki Roll - artichoke, asparagus, roasted red pepper & avocado rolled & topped with seared beef, served with creamy wasabi & drizzled with black pepper soy
OMG!
Mango Lobster Roll - lobster mix, avocado & cucumber rolled & topped with thinly sliced mango, served with mango-tobiko & kiwi-wasabi sauces
So Yum!!!If it weren't for the beer here, this place would just be another sports bar type of place. Just cover the floor with sawdust and it'd be set. They've got a great selection of beer and that's it and that's all. The food here ranges from "meh" to "wtf were they thinking? Chipotle hummus? Maybe after that they can work on salmon flavored ice cream for a dessert menu. All jabbing aside, the beers here are all very distinct and cover a pretty good range. Anything from a dark to light as well as a pretty wide range of flavors. The Peach Ale is a favorite of mine and it's not too heavy either. As far as prices go, it's incredibly cheap for what you get. A big glass of beer for a small note always equal a good time.Since it was COLD on Friday, my wife and I decided to go to Chen's for lunch. I don't know why we didn't think of Pei Wei but this restaurant is much closer to our house. 
My wife ordered the Chicken Rice Bowl and I ordered the Chicken with Rice Noodles off the Lunch menu. It came with egg flower soup which was nice an hot. When my meal came, I can't figure out why they would give me fried rice with noodles...double the starch. I really enjoyed it. The egg roll was made with just vegetables...so, so. But I didn't like the fried Won Ton which was crispy on the outside but REALLY dry on the inside. Can't complain for two hot meals under $10.The Sets offers something for everyone. There are a few different rooms, including a live music venue, an atrium with patio seating, a pool hall and the main bar, which is filled with fun games like air hockey and video games. The bar tends to be filled with a younger crowd on week nights since the club hosts all-ages shows, but on the weekends you'll find more of a 21+ crowd.We ate at the S.T. in Tempe once to twice a week before the change to the Field Kitchen (or whatever they called it). Last week we returned for the first time since the return to S.T. 

The first thing we noticed was the fewer selections, fewer customers and some layout changes. When we sat to eat, the most noticeable thing was the lack of freshness of the lettuce, Before it was always super crisp, now it was not. The food was still overall good. They reduced the soups but the chili was still ok. Moving the beverage to the ice cream bar seems to be a bit cramped but the old location was not real good ether.

We will try a different location next time and see if just this location didn't quite recover from the Field Kitchen. Other locations are a longer drive so we will probably never return to twice a week customers.Clean but a little too family oriented for me. There are always kids and even though I request not be to near their lanes we always end up by them. Beer selection is decent, the remodel looks nice. Animations on the screens are bizarre. Go on Sunday for DOLLAR MANIA, including $1 PBR pours.I thought this place was really good for what it is. I don't really understand all the awards and hype for it though... In the end it's just a hot dog to me. I enjoyed my regular hot dog with mustard, onions, sauerkraut, and a pickle. I have to say the real star of the meal was the onion rings! They were unfortunately very addicting. We got a strawberry milkshake as well and it was delicious.Very cheap massages ($25 for 1 hour), and they often have specials where it is 2 for 1.  Usually during the time period where the "specials" apply is when they are bringing in a new batch of students that need clinical experience.  Your massage will pretty much be a toss up since you are assigned a student at random.  You do have the choice of whether to have a lady masseuse or a man-sseuse.  If you have no preference, chances are you will get a man-sseuse.  I've been here a few times, and so far I've been pretty satisfied with the massages I've gotten considering that they are done by students and also since the price is so reasonable.  If you go, there is just a flat fee, since no tipping is allowed.I went to Salazar Bros because of the reviews I read here, and I was not very impressed... Its just like a Filberto's, nothing about it was unique. I ordered a chimi and it was ok - just ok. Nothing to rave about, but a quick fix if you're looking for cheap/fast Mexican food.I cant find church that I like anymore in AZ. 

I could go on on why this church is not for me. My parents go here...make sense.


I will give $50 to the person that finds a good church in AZ...and plz dont say CVV  FBC orJoyCame here for a carry out order.  Food was nothing special.  Not horrible, but not memorable either.  The lady behind the counter, although not unpleasant, was not very welcoming either.  Think I'll stick to my faves, Big Heng and Golden Rice Express.  A bit farther away, but better than here, I think.Decent sushi place in glendale.I would say solid 3 for sure. Came here because of Triple D (love that show, can you tell?). It was pretty close to closing time (hate doing that but couldn't help it this time) so it seemed like the waitresses were eager to get us seated and our drinks and food and out of there. But, I understand. 

Ordered the pulled pork sandwich and it was decent. Nothing to rave about unfortunately. The other people in my party felt the same way about their food. It was good but not that good (sorry Guy not that great here...I've had WAY better at other places..Calhouns in Murrieta!!).

I did love their sauce and they sell it so you can take it home! YAY! Loved the random weird unique decor. We sat at the booth and it was really worn feeling and I felt like a 6 year old sitting down.

But, I would actually come back in the afternoon for lunch and try something else though.Tons of stuff but not a very good size selection.  They have a bit of everything but never seem to have what I am looking for.  Always sold out of Large and XL women's sizes, and don't carry talls when the label makes talls.  What they do have right is the sunglasses selection.  Ironman wrap arounds that are great for outdoor sports at a reasonable price. 

Every time I am in Arizona, I find myself hitting up this store for something.  I can find what I need about 50% of the time.They upgraded the inside very nicely (a year or so ago) and it's modern and cute.

The food is ok ...not the best. I ordered the steak and blue salad (supposed to have steak and blue cheese in it as the name suggests) they forgot the blue cheese. humm?

Their wine is not worth it.  The bread is ok but every time i've been there - it took a loooong time for it to make it to the table.

The Pasta is so/so.  The Pasta Martini is inconsistent - sometimes the sauce is too alfredo-ish and it's icky.  Can't really go wrong with the Italian Sausage Pasta and i like the Pasta Rustico (add the chicken to it! )  - but they are just typical fare. 

Sandwiches are pretty tasty.  

I'm giving it a 3start rating because it's good but never sticks out in my mind that I want to go there again.I have eaten at this place for many years, and since it was Mr Sushi quite a while ago. 

It is a cute little family owned restaurant and the food is pretty good, although the sushi rolls are very small. The green tea from here is very good and the sushi comes out quickly.

I like this place, but none of the food ever really stands out or really impresses me. It is never bad though either, which is why I gave it 3 stars.So, I've changed my tune a bit on HH. It's not frozen dough (I've seen them making the dough fresh) and it's not bad tasting at all. Try the garlic seasoned crust and with one of their frequent coupon mailers, it's hard to find better quality for the price. The staff are super-consistent and pleasant to deal with.We come here for pies and they do not disappoint. Have had lunch here once or twice, and it is OK, but it is the pies that make the trip. I recommend the mixed berry or the coconut cream.Ate there tonight it was okay but was surprised the quality was not as good as others I have eaten at ( Colorado ). The waitress took money and assumed what was left was for her and never came back! To much money was left even for 20 percent tip! My food was very greasy and chicken was overcooked no hurry to go back!This place is alright but the mark up on their stuff is ridic. I only stop in here for some dog food and that's it. Anything else and you're getting robbed. Sometimes the lines can get jammed up too.Seating inside is very limited, there was more outside however hopefully you like the sound and view of traffic from Grand. Staff is friendly however they didn't seem like they know what they were doing. Plus they messed my order up, ordered a tall chai tea and got charged for the grande, I tried to explain but he didn't seem to know the difference. Not the Starbucks you want to come to if your trying to read a book or study a bit, it's more of a social Starbucks.My best friend and I tried this place because she lives in the Henderson area now. The staff was relatively friendly, but the quality of the work was not so great. We both got full sets of pink and white powder with gel and my set got filed unevenly and when I pointed it out, she continued to file it, making it worse and more crooked.

I also had several nails that I had to show her were inconsistent lengths, which more filing still didn't help. Plus, both of our sets started pulling up on the sides within a week. When I went to my usual nail salon two weeks later, he had to pull the whole set off because two nails had internal cracks and he popped them off way too easily. 

Spend the extra 5 or 10 bucks on a set elsewhere.Welcome to Dan's adventures in the ghetto. A friend and I decided that we needed to explore the options in our work neighborhood (emphasis on 'hood').  Our first pick, USS Fish and Chips.  

I'm not a big fish and chips person.  Most of the fish and chips dishes I have tried have been soggy, dry, or just plain nasty.  Even though USS is a Korean restaurant, I decided to try their claim to fame cuisine.  A big plate of 3 big fish strips and potato wedges costed about $6.75.  I was completely blown away.  This was the best fish and chips I think I have ever had!  They were pleasantly fried, not too thick and greasy.  The fish was tasty on it's own, but even tastier with some malt vinegar and tarter sauce.  The potato wedges were shaped like little chips, about a centimeter thick. They were light and fluffy, but meaty at the same time.

You don't come to USS for the atmosphere.  You probably don't come for the gourmet service either.  You may have to dodge the occasional drug dealer or hobo, but for a decent fish and chip dish it is worth it.  Pleasantly surprised.  I would return.  Beware of the Cash Only policy.Bomb.com but 1hour wait FK that. with all the $$ they make they need to expand the place.Nice place and good salsa but wasn't impressed with my sizzling enchiladas. The waiter was very nice and the service good. I may come back to try something different but nothing real special about the enchiladas unfortunately.Checked this out with a chef friend of mine.  Nothing to really complain about at this place but nothing that blew me away.

I had the short rib dish - the short ribs were cooked well though it was kind of messing the melt in your mouth texture I like.  Might have been the short ribs themselves rather than the way it's cooked.  Came with a blah gnocci I didn't really like or hate.  Just blah.
My chef buddy had some pork special.  It was ok - but again nothing special.  Pork breaded and wrapped with something.  Just wasn't great.

Also ordered a side of spaghetti and marinara.  Nothing special - again.

Dessert was apple pie a la mode.  That was actually very nice.  Rich, flaky, great crust.

Not sure this place can justify the prices without a bit more flavor.Very clean and easy to find theater, great location inside the District. Had limited interactions with staff as I used fandango.com to print my coupon and didn't buy movie food. 

One annoying thing was that twice during the movie, a staff person walked across the theater and back. As I was in the first row of the main level, the person walked across my movie basically 4 times. 
Sure it was a Wednesday late night and only a few people in theater watching a drama but very much a distraction to the overall movie experience!!!  I would have told someone at the end of the movie but there was no one to be found afterwards as I'm sure they were getting ready to lock up and close.I played this course in Early August on my trip to Las Vegas.  I was solo, so I was teamed with 3 other golfers that were friends. The course is tricky at some spots, and playing with locals helped a bit.  I wasn't hitting the ball that good, so I go myself into trouble a couple of times.  The beverage cart girl came around 3 or more times, and that was very good because the temperature was around 105-110.

The reason I say so/so shape is because some of the greens were burnt out, and some of the fairways were in rough shape. Although this was probably my favorite course, just because the pace of play was pretty good. A lot of the other courses over sell the tee times, so you are waiting to hit every shot.

I would play it again, but I would wait till next year to see of the shape of the course improves.Going to keep this sweet and simple.. been here 3x and everytime the service and the food has been consistent. Consistency is good, but the food is average. I've never left here with a great impression besides WOW this place is crowded.. LOL. 

People tend to rave about the fried calamari, from a scale of 1-10, it's a 6 (fried garlic is sprinkle around the calamari, the dipping sauce is pretty good)the food is okay. but coming from the bay area where there are tons of vietnamese restaurants, it's not quite up to par. we had pho, and goi cuon. both were decent. i would not come back here if there was another vietnamese restaurant.This place's best deal would have to be their all you can eat buffet. They have one for dinner after 11 pm, and one for lunch. $16.99 or $13.99 is way cheaper price than some other korean places. I wouldn't recommend the squid because it came as a whole piece and not flavored. You should get the beef flank or marinated beef - those are pretty good. comes with salad bowl. I got the seafood beef tofu soup - not that great. I had it extra-spciy. Basically mean they add more red pepper, but not spicy. And the soup had like clam shell pieces, so I get this random "crunch" sound when I bite. Their appetizers are probably one of the best, if not the best I have in vegas. seaweed, fish/tofu strip, soybean sprouts, kimchi, cucumber, onion pancake (best), clear noodle.Hmmmm. This is a Vegas classic, dark, smokey, cheap drinks and cheap food. I was there with a group of maybe 12. We did find seating, although we had to inhabit one of their 4- plex poker machine table thingys. I'm not much of a gambler but this place obviously caters to them big time. There are quite a few machines of all types stuffed into this place (and this place isn't all that big)
There was some kind of big wheel thing that people were spinning off and on throughout the night, not sure what you win, but it was the center of attention when someone stepped up to it.
Like I said, cheap drinks and cheap food. Friendly bartenders are key, and they nailed that one on the proverbial head. You can tell the regulars there too, nice people they were. Easy to strike up some convo with. Not a place I'd go out of my way for, but if in the area, it's a good watering hole for sure.So we went here at 4:30, and the place was practically empty.  So the service was excellent.  The lady who seated was very nice to my daughter.  My daughter was all dressed up and very proud of herself and getting complimented just made her day.

The soup and salad bar that came with the entrees were very good.  Nice variety.  The crab cakes were delish.  The dessert was good.  I like my filet.  My hubby thought his steak was a little gristly.  We ordered mac & cheese, but no one really liked it.  The mash potatoes were yummy.  Decent price on the wines by the glass. 

I'd give them 3.5 stars, but you can't.  We'd go back again.  I think it was a little overpriced.  We ended up spending over $100 with our restaurant.com coupon.  I think this place is on par with Outback.  Better than Sizzler.

What really made them shine was the excellent service from all wait staff.   They actually deserved the included 18% pre-added gratuity.My boyfriend and I come here for "Honey Toast" It'll be nice if they take some time to update their menu and organize it in ENGLISH & PICTURES with all the new menus they have on walls in japanese...I'm sure they have other good stuff we would like to try but, we can't even read most of them and they r so busy we don't wanna ask waitress about each one of them so we always have same food everytime...The Hard Hat lounge is a typical, traditional bar. It still has a kitchen-but since the smoking law came into affect a few years ago, the oven is idle. On the border of a sketchy neighborhood (the once fantastic Naked City), I had never had an issue visiting this bar. At nights you have to get buzzed in, but once you are in the mood is sedate and comfortable. A pool table exists in case you need more exercise than lifting your beer or your jack and coke! BUT--- the real star here is the mural by Frank "Maverick" Bowers from 1963.  The mural evokes more a feeling of 1956, than 63, but maybe The Maverick was stuck in his painting ways.  The legend has it that he painted the mural to pay off a bar tab (google his name and you may find more mentions of his doing this in other areas like Los Angeles). An awesome mural and one the bar is proud of!Food was good. I never had crepes so I wanted to try them. They were good but I'm not a fan of the cheese that they stuff them with. 

The worst thing about our first visit was we were seated by the bathrooms. I will take the blame as I should have said when they were seating us that we would just sit at the bar. The place was very busy and they had the other side closed. I really don't appreciate being sat by the bathroom in any restaurant.

We will go back and give it another go. :)Okay so I've been to Tea Station very many times and have probably adapted to their style of service. Sometimes they are understaffed, but I prefer to go in the daytime when it's not too busy because parking can get pretty terrible. There's also the option of getting a couple drinks to go. If you come with a group, they do expect most of your group to buy something. I also believe there is a $10 credit card minimum (before tip), so if you don't plan on spending that much be sure to bring cash. This place is also fairly overpriced for both food and drinks. We've tried a couple of the small food dishes, but I don't believe they are worth the price you pay.

Regardless of all this, we've returned time and time again because they do make great drinks! I've been to multiple similar restaurants and have not found many that make perfectly flavorful and frothy Thai Tea as the one I buy at Tea Station. I've also tried at least 15 different drinks here (iced tea, hot tea, snow ice, etc.) and have yet to feel disappointed.

So in summary, I would suggest that you only come here for drinks and try your best to avoid busy hours. But I really don't think this place is as bad as many of these reviews make it out to be. As a side note, I've actually been to a Tea Station in California where the restaurant had a much better setup and improved customer service. I definitely preferred the California TS, but for now I don't really mind the troubles of attending this one.Decent button-up shirts at reasonable prices.  One of the better stores at the outlet mall, in my opinion.Many many moons ago I used to live in this area and have seen what
kind of shenanigans can go down at the seven seas ... But... during the day when you're feeling hungry and the only thing that will make you feel better is cat fish nuggets then dammnit.. The Seas can't be beat!!

Im a huge fan of their cat fish and even their hot links are grilled to
perfection. The food is greasy and comforting when you need just that kind of fix. If you want anything healthy you're absolutely in the wrong establishment. 

There is a bar next door that opens at noon and while waiting for my food I ventured over to ask about their drinks. They have two for Tuesdays drink specials on everything except top shelf drinks which as we know can't be beat. 

I'll be back to The Seas but I doubt it will be anytime soon.. there simply not enough stuff on their limited menu to bring me in week after week but its still ... regardless !The store is usually clean and they have lots of deals going on!Yes, I know its Domino's, and I know there are better pizza places in town. However, when I want cheap, good, and fast delivery pizza, I call my neighborhood Domino's. I wasn't a huge fan of Domino's until they went through the whole ordeal where they changed their sauce, crust, ingredients etc after much public outcry (I didn't hear it, but it must have been crazy :-P ). I only really ate it in a pinch. Our typical order is thin crust with either white sauce, feta and onions, or some variety of veggies with red sauce. When we get the pizza, it always looks appetizing. I can't say this even for the more "fancier" pizza joints. Additionally, the delivery is always within 30-45 minutes, which is not the case for other places, even ones that are much closer to us. The ingredients are fresh, and the crust is usually very crispy but not hard. 
I will also say that my most favorite thing about Domino's is the Noid...wait, wrong decade, its actually the online ordering. Domino's order tracker is very cool, its accurate and sometimes I just watch it while I am waiting for my pizza.The food's just OK. Generally crowded with those who prefer "trendy" to dining at these prices. If one defines "intimate" as noisy, that works. I will say that the lakeside location is nice. It's overpriced. In fact, I can eat at Bouchon, have a great dinner, with the same noise, better ambience and certainly finer food.I've only came here briefly a few times to eat at Hooters restaurant and to shop at the Team Punishment store.  The store itself reminded me of a smaller hot topic.. meaning it was tiny and made me feel claustrophobic.  As always, any t-shirts i wanted to buy came in every single size but small.. bastards.. but they had a nice selection of women's apparel.  I lucked out and they were selling Hitman Fightgear tank tops for 50% off... and in size small!!!!DIM SUM! my fave thing, shrimp balls. they're salt/pepp shrimp is comparable here to other places bc it's gross....Grilling outside, great lure.. the smell is incredible. 

Stopped in for lunch and was quite surprised. The appearence on the outside makes you think you are going into a hole in the wall. However open the door and its very spacious. 

The menu reminded me of a very popular spot down on Charleston. Especially since they serve chicken wraps with sides of spinach feta pasta or chicken pasta, hmmmm... Have seen those somewhere else.. 

The wrap was good! Tender chicken, loaded with crisp vegetables. The portion size was great, not too big or small. I got the chicken pasta as a side. It had a sweet flavor to it, not too appetizing. My friend got the spinach feta pasta which was a bit salty. 

My lunch with a drink was $12, a little pricey for a sandwich and 1 side and no table service. 

Not a bad place, but didn't taste anything that I would crave later to make me go back.Panera Bread used to one of my favorite places. I used to come in here a-lot to buy bagels and other goodies that I enjoy eating. However, things has changed due to my new visit here on sunday may 6 2012. I stopped there tonight wanting a sandwich and a salad. Well guess what -they closed early due to a meeting/training( this meeting should have been held some other time without closing or they could have made it aware to customers on a website or somethings). Its ok because not only did i waste my time & gas, but I came across a new deli that will be getting my business. So thanks vey much- and yes i will miss my fiji apple chicken salad,  but o- well.One thing you have to like about Starbucks is that you get a consistent drink every time. Sometimes though its about how long one needs to wait for this consistence. It's location has been remodeled recently and looks amazing. 

That is all ...It was good, but nothing to write home about.  Had the sampler, tea, and buff.We went here for the first time last night and enjoyed our experience.  We had the SAMBAL GORENG TEMPE, BAKMI JAHE, SATE SAPI.  I like that they have the vegetarian options, including substituting beef and chicken with tofu.  

Like a previous yelper mentioned, it does seem that the entire wait staff are dark-haired girls with multiple tattoos and facial piercings.  However, they were just as professional and friendly as the more traditional looking wait staff, so who cares!  

The atmosphere is nice, calm, dimly light, we liked that too.

I gave this experience 3 stars because the food was good, but not "I must have more or I will die" good.  Plus, we waited a long time for the food to come to the table and when we were done with the main course we weren't offered dessert, which we would have liked to try since the whole Indonesian cuisine thing was new to us.In town visiting friends & family and we ordered pizza from Glass Nickel one night.  Ordering online was easy and convenient.  We had the feta pizza and couch potato. Very tasty for a local area pizza place.  I'll admit I'm a little spoiled living in the same city as Tom Douglas's Serious pie.The atmosphere and the service were both very good. The food would be very good if it were not **extremely salty** :(Just happened to be walking down the street and stopped for a frozen custard. It was okay, portion size was good, just nothing amazing about it.This is a pretty average Chinese buffet. Some of the food is quite good. I went at 1:00p on a week day and some of the buffet dishes were dried out. The staff was friendly. There cubby for the drink fountain and bus station smelled slightly moldy. It was noticeable whenever I walked by. 

I would eat here again because their selection was good and the price was about $7.50 with a drink.The Blooming Onion is very good. I have urges when driving by one to stop for just the blooming onion with the its great sauce. Not interested in eating their steaks -- no real reason.I finally gave in to the husband's request to come to McGurkees. This place is in my neighborhood and it's cuter inside than you would think. You walk up to the counter to place your order and I'm pretty sure we ordered with the owner, who seemed like a nice guy. I was a little disappointed because the sign says they have pizza, but really they only have sandwiches... a little disappointing. I had the meatball sub with cheese and a salad. The salad is basic rabbit salad with that gloppy italian dressing you can get for a dollar at the grocery store.... you know what I'm talking about. Not impressive. The sandwich was fine, if a bit bland. Unfortunately, there was nothing special about it. I might be back due solely to proximity but I wouldn't run back here for any reason.This is a good place to get a cheap meal. The food is nothing to write home about but it wasn't bad either and CHEAP! I liked the fun atmosphere.We've become semi-regulars at Manuel's lately...usually for happy hour in the bar.  Well the bar is currently being renovated so my wife, daughter and I had dinner in the restaurant last night.  

We were greeted nicely and quickly seated.  My appetizer plate was a little dirty and when I borrowed one from another table the bus boy came by and apologized profusely.  I told him no big deal...those things happen.  Waiter was excellent...very friendly and with a good sense of humor.

Chips and salsa were very good.  Two kinds of salsa...mild and hotter.  My wife and daughter prefer the mild but I like the hot stuff.  Chips were warm and fresh.  Waiter was attentive and kept the basket filled.

Now on to the food...I had the carne asada burro norteño style.  Excellent flavor to the meat - sauce could have been a little more spicy though.  My wife had a chimi enchilada style..she liked it too.  Daughter wasn't too hungry so she just had a couple of beef tacos.  The plate was emptied so I assume that she liked it also.

All in all, a pretty decent meal.Food was good, decor is a bit old.. is a good place to stop if you are in the area but would not go out of my way for it.This is a great muni course with a perfect par 3 course when you want to squeeze out a 45 minute round after work with some good company or work on your short game by yourself. Fun moment on the par 3 was the 181 yarder that I decided to use a 3 wood and pretty much flew the course at about 240 (accidentally).

I like all of the courses Aguila offers and they have great happy hour prices if you decide to golf after work as said earlier.

The parking situation is fine, the service is fine, and they offer everything a golfer could ever need even rental clubs. ( Wilson staff)

I would recommend this course if you want a good deal... be sure to check golf nowI was randomly in Mesa with two people who also have no knowledge of Mesa. We ended up here and it was fine - but probably not the place we had in mind. 

Red, White, and Brew is like a glorified Applebee's. Lots of families, lots of wood booths. Based off the name, I was hoping to be blown away by the beer selection, but it was pretty standard. 

Maybe the real problem was that our server was a little odd. Very friendly, but odd. He stood a little too close, came over a little too often. One of the odder things was that he snatched my full glass of water because there was no ice in it anymore ... that had been intentional - I don't like ice in my water and had been waiting for it to melt. Again, not ill-intentioned, but a little odd. 

We ordered the pita pizza appetizer and it was cold - the cheese partially melted. Meh. The mains were all fine - but again, very comprable to an Applebees. 

I don't live anywhere near here, but if I did - I wouldn't be back.The breakfast club is definitely a great stand-by for good brunch food.  My personal favorite is the Turkey Bene, I really appreciate how great their hollandaise sauce is.  Also, the portions are great for the price.

I see this situation so often though where the food is great, but the service is pretty crappy.  The last time I went to the BClub was on a Sunday, which of course is their busiest day.  Our server didn't make eye contact with us for the first half of the meal.  Not even a smile.  I get it, Sundays probably suck to work as a brunch server...but hey, no one is forcing you to work here.  Put on your smile, and get through it.

If you want a conveniently located brunch place with good food, and you don't mind a wait, check this place out...just don't expect bubbly servers.
To improve the experience, stop by the bungalow across the street for a mimosa during your wait.When I didnt have some many requirements for where I will  eat I used to eat here. The sandwiches are really good and the onions are sliced really thin, the pickles are sliced filet stylr. The toppings are way fresher than its competators. 

Good sammies cheap. Better meat too they slice it right thereWhen we walked in, it smelled like Swiss Cheese was on the griddle. It stayed that way the entire time...

A few loud birthday celebrations going on. Cool. Its an ice cream shop. 

Our server did not care about what was going on  in the joint. Tried to get some birthday candles in our ice cream, didn't happen. Wasn't our birthday anyhow. Ice Cream was good, not amazing, not awful. 

Do note, if you're coming here expecting sugar bowls on the tables, you will be sorely shocked to find they only have sugar packets...This place was recommended by shaking up UrbanSpoon on my iPhone. 

The goods...super fast service...lots of salsa (both hot and mild) is provided and the tortilla chips were delivered warm.  Iced tea tasted fresh.  The glass was refilled quickly (I sat at the bar).  Very cool building, the blue windows are very cool, looks like a spaceship.  I order a chicken chimi, which was decent.  It was delivered so quick, I didn't think it was possible to fry up a chimi so quick.

The not so goods...
The chimi had a bit more tortilla than I usually like.  The mild salsa wasn't bad, but wasn't great.  It was a bit pricy for a lunch stop (for me anyways), not the best value.

I'd go again, but only if I was in the area.I have a love hate relationship with this place...

Why I love Kaz bar:  
Atmosphere is so unique and romantic, great wine selections, live music almost every night of the week and I can't get enough of the chocolate fondu ;)

Why I hate Kaz bar: 
Service is always a crapshoot; most of the time the servers and bartenders act too stuck up to take care of you so I struggle with that at times.  I hate that attitude and sometimes just walk out after fighting for some attention from the staff

All and all I do like coming here and do tell friends about it, but warn people about the service.I'm glad there is a place to get a good slice in this particular part of South Scottsdale. Although the delivery took quite some time , I will say it was worth it and the left overs made a great hungover breakfast.If you are looking for an authentic southwest atmosphere do not come here. I would compare this to a Joes Crab Shack southwest style.  The decor was very cheesy. While the food was of good quality it was way overpriced. Did I mention it is overpriced? One and done with this place!So I have been in to this place several times and I would normally say they are worth giving five stars but my last visit wasn't so great. 

There beer selection is one of the best! You can create your own six pack and even by growlers! The option to make your own six pack makes for a great gift! 

The location is kind of hidden but when you first walk in your pretty surprised to see how big the restaurant actually is. 

Food - is pretty good I'd give them a an "B"- Try a pizza so far I've had the best luck with those. The Margarita pizza is great and the T-Rex is great for those meat lovers!!

Beer- Beer I would give an A++ Amazing beers in bottles. You can seriously find something for everyone! Draft beers are also superb- they have about 26 beers on tap and they majority of them are seasonal or rotating drafts ( which also is awesome if you like to try new things) the main guy behind the bar (dirty blonde hair) is extremely knowledgeable!! Tell him what you like or what you are in the mood for and i would be surprised if he didn't meet your need on the first try! If you get the right bar tender he will also mix beers to your liking (kinda interesting). 

Staff - I've had both good and bad experiences so I'll give them a "B-"

The last time I was in was by far the worst experience I had. We sat at the bar and it took the guy (brown hair and glasses) around five minuets to even notice we were sitting right in front of him. He didn't even say "hello" he just handed us menus and walked away. (not the way to start off) a few minuets later he came back and stood behind the bar and was cleaning dishware (just looked at us but didn't ask us for your drink order) we had to ask to order some beer... After giving us both samples (which felt like pulling teeth) we both ordered a beer. He then continued with the glasses without saying a word. as we looked over the menu and decided what we were going to eat we once again had to get his attention to take our order then again he turned around without saying a word. We both finished our beers (empty glasses) while he was standing right in front of us didn't ask if we wanted another beer or water... anything.. we hadn't even had our food yet so obviously we wanted another drink. Once again we had to get his attention to get another beer. After our food came out we enjoyed our entire meal without him coming over once to ask if everything was okay (my boyfriend actually had to get up and get napkins and silverware because he didn't offer us any when our food came). 

All in all I was totally confused by our experience this time around. the fact that we had to basically wave a red flag in front of his face to get his attention through our entire visit, the fact he didn't once make any attempt to make conversation ( you are a bartender/server isn't it your job to make customers feel comfortable and have an enjoyable experience?) I would have totally understood if this would have been a crazy busy night but It was a Monday night and the restaurant wasn't even remotely busy... it was odd.

I'll be back again to bring out-of -towners ( they always love this place) but until then I don't think I'll be back soon.Disappointing to say the least...The food and service are actually "so-so".  The beer is pretty good and the selection is sufficient.  Also, the place is rather upscale and clean so those are pluses as well.

The problem I have with GB is that the location, layout, and the fact that it's a brewery with a full kitchen suggest that it should be much MUCH better.  That is why I rate it as a 3-star place.The pho is good.  The other food is ok, I just hoping that they serve the food with a regular rice and not the broken riceIt's basically Trails without the guilt of funding a larger, more soulless business. They don't overcharge AS MUCH, and they have a better selection of hippie clothes, INCENSE (more than just Nag Champa!), and glassware. I'm not so sure the staff have expert opinions on their products, but at the same time I don't think the sort of clientele shuffling in really needs it.

There's a tip jar with the sole purpose of getting employees sloshed at a local brewery at the end of the month, and they openly admit this. I fully support this cause, and believe that we as a society should expand this practice. The Hippie Gypsy, with a vaguely mystic and antiquated style was a vaguely good place to shop.The location is nice, just located south of oldtown Scottsdale. The food is decent, overpriced for what you are getting. The pizza is paper thin, I'd like to be full after I eat a pizza but this one leaves you hungry. Servers are friendly and generally are attentive but this place is way too overrated because of the food quality. It is good but not great and not deserving of 4 stars. Also, because of the font they use the menus are almost impossible to read in the dark.This was my first time at Dilly's Deli - at the suggestion of a friend.  I can't say that the name would have drawn me in.

My wife's wrap was good and a good portion.  My half a sandwich, however, was long on bread and short on meat.  The flavor was excellent, but there just wasn't much there.

We may give Dilly's another chance.  Like I said, the quality was good and tasty, the proportion of bread to meat was just a little smaller than expected.I have been to Green on several occasions and I have never been as impressed as my friends. The jerk tofu and spicy peanut salad are good, but I feel they are overpriced for a few pieces of tofu/meat substitute and plain greens. The green burger was okay but I was surprised by how thin the patty was.

I am in love with their french fries, however! They are incredibly tasty, whether plain as a side or as an appetizer as the vegan chili fries (by far the best item of their menu!).

The tsoynamis are delicious no matter what flavor you get and that is definitely a selling point!We were seated immediately at 7:00pm. We were surprised that on a Saturday night this place was dead. The place needs a huge make over.  It's old and needs updating. We were seated in a booth that had a hole in the vinyl seat. The service was good. The food wasn't. I had a Gyro pita and the meat was tough like it was sitting out all day, it probably was. My friend ordered the Pastitzio. It was cold and dry. He ordered more marinera sauce to douse the dryness. The only thing tasty on the menu was the Saganaki. I don't think we are coming back anytime soon.Pricey for what you get. Went here after buying $150.00 worth of G.C. at Christmas. Buy $25.00 and get $5.00 free. Well the $30.00 worth of free expired four weeks after purchasing them. What a rip off! 

Had the Crab Buckets, very little meat in a lot of the crab legs. Some were less than 1'3 full. Sampler platter lukewarm. Server young, dumb but fun. Going to Pappadeaux's next time. Much better value and the food is always great!This is usually my go-to spot for filling any Rx's (especially since my surgery), but I find their online ordering inconsistent. Sometimes I get a courtesy email alerting me that my Rx is ready for pick-up, sometimes not. Sometimes I will get an email via walgreens.com with pick-up info, sometimes nothing. I know it's not the stores fault, but it really does frustrate me overall.

This location is decent but at times can appear cluttered and dusty. Customer service is okay too.It was just ok for us. I was disappointed in my steak and lobster. The barbecue was weird, and the rolls were very hard. I liked the ambiance, the place has charm. I doubt we will bother diving out here again,  but it wasn't the worst.It's a great little joint.  Locals only.  Cash only.  Breakfast basics.  The place looks like a dump and the guy in the kitchen with the cowboy hat is ornery.  We go there in a pinch for the basic breakfast stuff.   It's cheaper than going to the grocery store, buying the stuff, cooking it and cleaning up afterwards - honestly.  One can't beat a $5-7 breakfast.  I would not tell visitors to Phoenix to drive up here for this.  It's just too far to drive for a bunch of nothing.Meh! Food's alright. Ambience is okay. People are nice. Meh!Just a short note. Had several of the free coupons for food and decided to try the teryki burger. Went inside - server Lluvia - check # 0316-Tues May 6-5:25PM - I couldn't tell the name of the supervisor/shift mgr or whomever the "gal in charge" was. (she wasn't facing me but had a nametag on)I am assuming she was in charge as she was within earshot of customers asking another crew member if she would be the "shift mgr" - the other crew member(female)was reluctant-the mgr kept trying to convince her "you can do it" then going on and on abt how SHE herself did it in California - the server was polite but I did not care to know all the "behind the scenes" info going on. I come to Carl's a lot. I take advantage of all the great coupons you send me in the mail and I get with my order. Teryki burger was ok but we don't really like the bun - its hard.It seems like its wheat. Liked the regular old soft white ones. Turkey burger was good - again do not like the dark bun.

Do not mean to rag on Carls - just seems this visit wasn't the usual great customer service experience I usually have at this one.Domino's Pizza is nothing special, but it is not bad either. People seem to still consider this inexpensive pizza though, but it is far from that. I don't mind eating their pizza, but I wouldn't recommend it as being a good deal. There are several places that you can find better tasting pizza at for the same price.It's an Arby's, so no need to go into decor or menu selection and the such.  I eat at several different Arby's though, and this one has its good and bad.  First the good:

Food's always been hot, fresh, and delivered quicklly.  More quickly than at most Arby's I go to.  Not sure if I keep lucking out at this location or if everyone notices this, but it's been true on SEVERAL occasions.  Speedy service & nice enough.

The bad:

The music is horrible crap that my great-grandparents probably listened to growing up, and I'm 40.  Seriously - it's not "classic" by any stretch, not even just "old" - it's downright ancient.  ALWAYS.  They never change it, doesn't matter who's working or when you go.  You won't recognize a single tune unless you're 120 years old, and if that were the case you probably wouldn't remember it anyway.  I love classic rock and even old school Mowtown and the such, but this is beyond anything I've ever heard in a public place.  And it's annoying, especially when you're trying to enjoy a large Beef-n-Cheddar.  I had to literally throw the sandwich down my throat as fast as I could just to try to avoid getting a headache from the awful crooning coming through the cheesy Muzak machine, and even that didn't work.  I'm getting a headache just thinking about it now! 

It's either the drive-thru or a trip to the Sonic, Wendy's or Jack in the Box right next to this Arby's next time.  I've given them at least a half a dozen chances to change their tunes, but they keep playing it.  No more dining room eating in this location for me!

Oh yea - one more bad thing - there's a manager who likes to belittle her staff in front of customers sometimes.  At least I've heard it once or twice, and that's just not cool.  Minus 1/2 for occasional management actions, minus 1 1/2 for being too stupid to play music that is more universally acceptable in a public place.  Who makes that decision anyway?  Rap, Country, Death Metal - there's a reason businesses don't pipe this kind of music through their places.  It's annoying to most people who aren't part of that niche of listeners.  Same goes for anything that was old enough to be recorded on 8-tracks but not popular enough to be recorded onto CD's!

You've got good food Arby's Henderson - now get a clue!  Change the music.Watch out if you want delivery from The Lotus. I have had delivery from them twice without incident. But apparently they only offer it some days?? I just tried to place an order for delivery and was told the driver was off today.its a basic airport - funny though, you'd think Vegas would have something spectacularIt's decent. I wish the shuttles to the hotels took debit. They only take cash, and there is no clear idea if it goes to your hotel. You just have a guy saying "Yeah I can get you there" which reminded me of those private taxi cabs in New York. He didn't take us to our hotel by the way. We were dropped off at Planet Hollywood and had to walk to the Grand Chateau. 

Overall, it's pretty big and has that Las Vegas style. So when you land, you know you're in Vegas.They didn't frisk me, which is a negative or a positive depending on what kind of mood I'm in, and the fella that checked my ticket was a sweet pea.One of the most annoying things about flying is pulling in off the taxiway to find your gate occupied.  Then the airline makes you wait until the squatter finally departs.  This is craziness!  Pick a new gate and move on.  All planes have radios, GPS, and other tech so that the airport should know full well when the plane will be inbound.  Any airline that can't be prepared for an inbound aircraft shows their incompetence.You know...it's hit or miss. There are times when the flight attendants are like "I hate my life, what do you want to drink" and there are other times when they are like "OMG, it's your bachelorette? Drinks on me!" So It's hard to say. I will say one thing. This is the first airline where I heard a female pilot speak to the passengers! #feminist! I was so excited! You go girl! And it was a great landing! We need more female pilots...

They also have great honey roasted peanuts. So delicious! MmmmMm! Except if one person on the plane is allergic to peanuts, the entire plane has to eat pretzels. Lame. Can't that person just walk around with their Epi pen? #allergyproblems But if you ask the flight attendants for extra, they will give it to you. 

I wish they flew from SFO to Ontario. Why don't they do that?! I'm stuck flying from Oakland and dealing with the AirBart! I can't even drink my drank! (Unless you have an enclosed container...and btw, I was talking about coffee...this time). 

Lastly and the best part...they totally put you on different flights in case you miss your flight. As long as there is room. They are great about that. I've never been charged extra...unless I do it by the phone. But if you do it directly at the airport, they're good, as long as you aren't checking in bags. I like that a lot! I hope they don't change it.Great place to go to get that old Vegas Vibe.. I've always been able to find $5 craps (and sometimes $3).. even on weekends. It's a tad smokey, and I've found some dealers that are a tad inept, but they have great spirit, and the people that play here are much nicer than folks you find on the strip. People seem to give a damn that the shrimp cocktail went from .99 to 1.99, but I find that stuff sick so I won't go there...Truly old town Vegas, right off of the Fremont Street Experience.  I can't say anything for the Hotel, but the casino has some first rate slot machines, all first run, all bright, shiny and some are even blinding (I suggest avoiding the crystal game near Godzilla).

Lots of progressive slots. Some live entertainment - at least there was when i was wandering through, and she was damned funny. I noticed that it appeared to have gone a renovation recently and that's probably a good thing. Some lovely Chiluly glass in their eatery and above their high stakes tables brought out the "MONEY" vibe to the floor. 

If I get a chance, I'll come back and check this place out again. I Know for certain that the guys must love the dealer's. They're lovely eye candy in their red and black ensembles.I've been here over a dozen times over the years for lunch and dinner, and I just realized I've never put in a review for this place!  Probably because I get distracted by the beer over at Triple 7 next door.

Garden Court Buffet is located in the Main Street Station Casino in Downtown LV.  I'll go with many Yelpers here and say that this is probably the best Downtown has to offer so far as to buffets.  Case in point:  Hawaiian food offerings!

I'll start off with what I like the best.  Being from Hawaii, I often miss simple Hawaiian dishes.  Would it kill buffets out here to cook white Calrose rice properly??  None of this Uncle Ben's long grain, rice pilaf junk.  Sticky...white...rice!  Buffets out there would make a killing if you just made white rice, sautéed SPAM, scrambled eggs, and laid out a big bottle of furikake.  Feed dozens of people with little off your bottom line!

Garden Court Buffet has a little corner section on the far side of the buffet that hides these Hawaiian goodies.  It's basic in terms of Hawaiian cuisine, not always made the way locals would make it, but at the very least it's there.  On many days at the buffet you'll see:

-Sticky white rice
-Kalua pig and cabbage
-Oxtail stew (mainly at dinner but YES!)

As soon as I pay, I'm off to that little corner of treasured eats!  On the days I'm lucky I get treated with oxtail stew.  OMG...OMG!  One of my favorite comfort eats of all time!  You see me, and I'm sucking on the cartilage of a divine oxtail?  Leave me alone!  I will give you my autograph at some other time.  It's not the best oxtail stew I've ever had (that would go to ME) but dang is the one at Garden Court Buffet delicious.  Big, pretty meaty pieces of beef oxtail that has been simmering for hours in a stew mixture of carrots, celery, potatoes, tomato sauce, and other spices.  It has to be HOURS in order to make the meat of the oxtail fall off the bone tender.  A chewy oxtail is not a happy oxtail!  I'll be honest, the last time I made oxtail stew it took me a total of TWO (yep..TWO) days to finish the dish.  My guess is the oxtail stew over at the buffet is made with the help of a pressure cooker, which will drastically cut down on cooking time (but still deliver tender meat).  I will set there the entire time at the buffet with multiple plates of white rice, drenched with their oxtail stew.  By the end, my mouth and fingers will be sticky from the beefy tendon juices.  Oh, the horror!  The succulent, gelatinous horror!

Yes I just wasted an entire paragraph on oxtail stew.  But no other buffet in Las Vegas has it right now.  Garden Court Buffet does have other sections of course for gluttony:

-Asian
-Mexican
-Italian
-American
-Salad Bar (very meh)
-Dessert

They also do have theme nights like all-you-can-eat prime rib, or seafood, but I really only pay attention to these areas when there is no oxtail stew.  And when there is no oxtail stew I'm a grumpy boy!  Really, because majority of their other food is just OK.  Not bad, but nothing to write to Bon Appetit about.  It is average to what you find in your local Station Casinos buffet.  

I was so into the oxtail that I totally forgot to take a picture of anything for this review.  Sorry!  Maybe next time after I wipe the drool off my chin.Not sold on Bonito Michoacan.  Food was mediocre.  Guacamole was wonderful- avocados freshly cut in front of us.  Sangria tasted like cheap box wine with lemons.  Shrimp enchiladas were good.  Would stray away from this place but wouldn't suggest it. Maybe better for takeout...It was between here and Amigos Tacos, I decided to try this place because the reviews were pretty good. The parking was wide open, we were seated immediately and as I was excitedly anticipating, we got our chips - salsa - and beans. The chips were good, fresh. The salsa was very good for me but my BF prefers salsa with a little kick. The beans... well... they were OK, a little salty, but add salsa to the beans and a wonderful treat. 

The menu is HUGE! It took me a while to go through everything and make a decision, I finally decided on the 2 taco combo (beef tacos) and he got the beef enchilada with green sauce combo. While snacking on the chips they brought out a soup.. I wasn't expecting soup, I still don't know what kind of soup it was but it was OK. About 2 minutes after the soup came, our meal came... The food looked good, plates were hot, that's always a good sign. 

Now the meal... I took a bite of my taco and it was... a taco. The beef was lacking flavor, it was almost like they didn't season it while cooking, every Mexican restaurant I have been to has always used a combo of onions and other veggies/herbs to season their meat.. it just seemed.. blah. The rice was good, a little on the salty side as well and I usually put salt on everything, I like salt, but it was too salty for even me. my BF and I swapped plates to try each others dishes and his was very good. His beef was good, and it was the same type but since his food was covered lightly with enchilada sauce... i think it helped it out. I used some of his sour cream and the salsa and fixed up my taco.. not amazing but it was good. 

All in all, I am happy we got to try it and I would come here again but I would definitely order something different. I will give Amigos Tacos a try next time and hope that their menu isn't as costly as it was here... over 5$ for guacamole..? Not worth it. But the main reason I will come back was the service, everyone was very friendly, our server paid attention to our table and once our drinks were half empty they had fresh ones on the table...My friend bought a pre-loaded card at Costco wayyyy back and wanted to use the card.  Do I want to try go-karting?  OK!  Let me state first that I have never go-karted before.  I had a great time and was glad the place wasn't crowded (we went during the week during the mid-afternoon).

Cost: $25/race (each race lasts 10 minutes).  Mandatory headsocks available for $2 each (can bring these next visit).  Lockers are $0.50.  There were a couple of vending machines with the usual products for the usual jacked-up prices.

The track itself wasn't extremely complicated (see photos).  Prior to racing, we had to watch a safety video (no bumping....green pedal is the gas pedal, red is the brake, etc.).  Then we chose our helmets (Small through XXL) and gloves and were directed to our karts.  The place looked clean enough and the staff were really nice.

I can't imagine doing this in the summer!  There's a lot of heat generated by the karts.  Definitely go during the winter.  This would be a fun group outing during the holidays if you wanted to spend some Christmas cash.

Wear closed-toe shoes!  No sandals/flip-flops allowed!I was here for my brother's wedding last weekend; congratulations to Seattle yelpers Erik T and Laina B(T)! Anyway, I'll start my review with the wedding, since that was the best part. I'll let the happy couple expound on their wedding package when they write their own reviews, but it seems like they got a pretty good deal. The chapel is actually really nice - I posted a picture. It was elegant and not at all cheesy; there was no Excalibur theming at all, though I suppose they could probably do that if you wanted to. The ceremony was extremely organized and the staff was very helpful. I was a little worried when it was 10 minutes before the wedding and none of us knew what to do, but then they walked us through it, you go here, you go here, etc., and it all went off very smoothly. The prep room for the bride seemed nice enough, and I thought the flowers they provided were lovely. The ceremony itself was simple and well done, followed by photos taken by the Excalibur photographer. Again, well organized and painless, no standing around for ages. They had the chapel for an hour, so after the ceremony and the pictures, we had the rest of the time to hang out and take casual pictures, then when our time was up, the minister introduced the bride and groom and we were on our merry way. Very well done.

Moving on, I thought the food here sucked. Ate at Sherwood Forest cafe and the buffet. Bleah. But the happy couple got a nice dinner at the Sir Galahad steakhouse as part of their package and they really liked it, said it was comparable to Ruth's Chris. 

As for the rooms, meh. Our room was relatively clean; like others have said, it's Super8-ish, and even the non-smoking rooms still smell like smoke. There were not many amenities in the room - no fridge, no bedspreads, and the internet connection is expensive and is not wireless. I wouldn't have minded if we had paid the usual price, but unfortunately, there were 4 conventions in town this weekend and the prices everywhere were super jacked up, and we had to pay nearly $200/night, so obviously, it was not worth it. Still, it was convenient for the wedding, and I do give them props for keeping our party together, we all had rooms next to each other. The wedding couple had a suite, so of course it was nicer. But they did find a broken bong in their fridge, AND this was their second room because the first one had mold in it. Another person in the party was so upset with the disgustingness of her room that she checked out. So, I guess  it varies. 

**useful information alert** When I made the reservation by phone, she gave me a number to call for Express Checkin. You can call as early as 10:00am on the day you are arriving to pre-checkin. That way when you get there you can just go straight to the kiosk without waiting in line, just swipe your credit card and the machine spits out your room keys. Very convenient!

As for the casino, well, I wasn't here to gamble, but if I were, I would want to go somewhere other than here. If I want to smell like smoke and hang out with old people I can just go to any of the casinos back home. There's all these annoying tools that grab you at the door trying to rope you into whatever little deal they've got going on, so I really hated that. Once outside, I didn't want to go back in. Between all the noise and the smoke, I can't believe people take their kids here.This place seems to get kind of a bad rap, I really don't understand why. For the price you're paying and what you get its not so bad. We stayed here about 2 weeks ago, we payed just over 300 bucks to stay Friday to Tuesday which was the bast deal I found for a place on the strip. We stayed in tower 2, it was really quite nice, 2 beds, a flat screen tv, and a bathroom, we didn't spend much time in the room so it was perfect for what we needed. My only complaint was that i never got any cell phone signal in my room but i can also blame AT@T for that. The casino is kinda cheesy and I don't really like playing there, the pool was nice but the cabana we rented was kind of a let down, they advertised a platter of snacks and we got 2 fun size bag of lays BBQ potato chips LAME. I would stay here again if i was trying to do Vegas cheap, but i think I'm going to stay some where a little more classy next time.In case you are searching for this starbucks via GPS, note that it is right next to FedEx/Kinkos. In fact, it is attached with a passageway between them.

The interior walls are a wonderful deep purple color. I immediately and enthusiastically suggested to my wife that we paint our breakfast room this color. One eye roll later, the idea was nixed. Not happening...

As for coffee, my double expresso did the trick...Good food and great place to people watch once you've spent all your money gambling and/or shopping inside Caesars. Menu is constantly changing hence the inconsistency with the food but overall it's been decent.Games selection is quite small and when I went there. They closed early, earlier than most Gameworsk places. This might be one of the quietest and less profitable GW out there since it's Las Vegas. If this was connected or inside a casino. It would be more convenientPros: A deal for families and those traveling on a budget. Its located just of the strip and it is close enough to all attractions. It has a circus area full of carnival attractions and games. It has a decent buffet.

Cons: Our tub faucet leaked all night. We had to close the bathroom door because it was so loud. DO NOT PARTAKE IN THE HOTEL PROMOTIONS IN THE LOBBY. THEY ARE A WASTE OF YOUR TIME. THEY ARE JUST TRYING TO GET MONEY OUT OF YOU. DO NOT GO TO THE POLO TOWERS.If you are thinking along the lines of Super 8, Travelodge, Motel 6, etc for your next Vegas trip (and let's face it, everyone just needs a cheap, clean room every now and then), then you should really consider this place first.

The rooms, even the smallest ones, are bigger than the standard rooms at MGM, Excalibur, NYNY, etc. They are also clean, and have a fridge and bar area. They aren't fancy, but you won't be creeped out either.

This place is perfect if you will be spending most of your Vegas trip away from your room (concerts, sporting events, bachelor parties, etc) and just need an occasional hot shower and a nap.

The downsides are odd and minor. No ESPN or Comedy Central (fellas, if your girlfriend is here for a bachelorette party and you're left in the room, this could be a deal breaker). TV reception is oddly grainy considering this is 2014.

But this is the most important thing: don't stay here with the intention of walking back and forth to the Strip! Especially you ladies, please take the free shuttle from Mardi Gras (hourly), a cab, or the monorail (about a block away). I'm an athletic 30-something man, and it took me a full 25 minutes to walk to the Strip (briskly because it was cold). Also, the area gets a little sketchy after dark. Please don't walk!

But having said all of that, I paid $31 for a nice big room on a FRIDAY nite in Vegas (with major events happening that weekend), and it had everything a weekend warrior needs. If you need plush, this isn't the place. But if you need good value, it's hard to beat.2.75 stars. I recently found out that Benihana gives out $30 coupons for your birthday. So my friend and I, both with March b-days, decided to give it a go.

I've not had teppanyaki/hibachi grilled meals in a long time, so I was looking forward to it. Located in the LVH, Benihana is in this little Asian-themed restaurant area. Decor is lovely and fitting.

We had 7:30 reservations but were about 5 minutes late. We were seated just in time, as the rest of the people around the hibachi had just ordered. Unfortunately, the photographer had already made her rounds at the table and skipped us! Boo.

I got Rocky's Choice (steak & chicken) and my friend had the Imperial Steak. The meal came with soup, salad, shrimp and some veggies (onions, zucchini). When ordering your meal, the waitress will ask if you want fried rice -- my opinion is NO. Don't get it. Not worth the upgrade price for a little bowl. In fact, I just made my own fried rice by tossing the veggies and shrimp together with the steamed rice that comes with the meal. Ok, so it's not really fried. But the rice was getting cold (it came out right after the salad).

As for the showmanship of the hibachi chef, he was meh. The onion volcano was nice. Maybe it was just an off day for him. He wasn't very engaging, in my opinion.

Overall, I wouldn't go here again unless I had a coupon. So next year?The food was good. I had the Zuppa de Pesce (seafood soup) & he had the calzone. I really liked my dish. The flavor was good and there was plenty of seafood. He said his calzone was OK. The service is slower than molasses. The guy must have been 100 years old. It took forever for him to come by when we needed something and we waited for our bill for a good 15 minutes before we were able to flag him down for it. We sat in the "patio" and liked the people watching, too bad the ice cream stand was in our way. Whenever something interesting happened, like the performances, we couldn't see anything. Because I enjoyed the company, I still had a great time there.Cheap gaming and cheap drinks make this an easy place to spend a few hours at the north end of the strip. It feels more like gambling for fun than gambling to win - though the slots here did pay out pretty regularly. The crowds around the tables were also big on enjoying themselves.I am not an M&M fanatic, so I guess this may be why I didn't enjoy this place to the max.  I thought most of the items they had were interesting and cute, and my favorite was the wall of the colors sorted. Kind of strange seeing so many colors of M&Ms in one place. 
The thing that irked me a bit about this place was the weird chocolate smell. It wasn't like a delicious, "oh-my-gosh-I-want-chocolate-now" smell, but more like a stale, way too old Easter chocolate smell. Made me feel weird. 
When we left here, I felt like I didn't want to eat or see M&Ms for another month, at least. I think this is all a personal preference thing, but it was just a bit overwhelming to me. Don't go here unless you are crazy about this candy and won't get bored after 15 minutes or so, I think is what I'm trying to say.You would think it's the forum shops and people visit here from all over the world, and they would keep every size in stock. Well, no they don't.Avoid room 115, it is inches from the lobby and between the entrance and the elevators...

The lobby is fine. I've never been awake for the breakfast so can't comment on that. On more than one occasion I've been given a room key that doesn't work or a room that is occupied, both requiring a frustrating trip back to the front desk after a long day of work. 

Airport shuttle is friendly and accommodating. They also will give you a ride to Bally's or the Mall. The shuttle is their strongest point.

The girls at the front desk are kind but typically lack understanding on requests to the front desk or any kind of abnormal situation. The area around the hotel is sketchy. There are a couple of places to eat, the closest being a McDonald's. Near by there is a tapas bar and a good sub shop as well though. 

A fine place if you're in town very shortly or strictly for business (having a car would be a huge plus). Would not recommend if you are going to Vegas for vacation or a visit to the strip.From my time in the military I have had my share of strip clubs, and maybe that's why I gave this place just 2 stars..? Or was it because A BOTTLE OF BEER COST DAMN NEAR $20 BUCKS!!..Now I'm not complaining about service because it was not badd at all. Some dude took us to a table that could fit all 8 of my crew then came a stable of hoe's (no disrespect to the strippers, just what guys refer to them as!) who's mission is to clean you out of every dime in your pocket while smiling and shoving Ta Ta's in your face....not complaining, we all have our roles to play, theirs is to get it and  ours was to keep as much of the green in our pockets!..lol We stayed there about 40mins before we realized that this was going no where fast, and we needed to roll before they end up with ALL our money!..Overall nice setup, pretty girls, helpful staff and expensive drinks but what do you expect...ITS VEGAS GO BIG OR GO HOME...so we went ELSEWHERE!..Got dragged here with the rest of our group after leaving the Cosmopolitan, but I guess they're aren't too many great choices to grab some cheap eats on the way back to our hotel.  I don't regularly eat at Chipotle even back in San Jose, but I was exhausted and hungry after a raging afternoon.  

I asked my other friends about what they usually order and decided to try the Burrito Bowl which I hadn't tried before.  Choose whatever you want in it, just like you do with the usual Burritos or Tacos.  The bowl was a decent size, but only tasted good during the first 5 minutes of eating it.  I'd get kind of sick of the taste of this food if I came here on a regular basis.  

That aside, the place was pretty damn busy with all types of Vegas weirdos coming through to eat.  There is a freaking Panda in the same space as Chipotle!  The tables were kinda small and we had to split our group up.  Had a pretty fun time eating here and coming off our afternoon drunkenness.Over priced...over priced...over priced. I know, I'm in Vegas, on the strip, in MGM grand. But this food is one step above Denny's. Not worth the incredible prices. This was one I wanted to try and we did. I wanted to love it but I couldn't.  

Tip:
Go and just order the nachos (f you have 2 people). The portion is so ginormous you will be both beyond full. Cuts down on cost!!! We shared the nachos and 2 waters paid around $15 total. Not bad.Much better gambling return than on the strip.Usually fast service. This place is in need of a remodel and some up keeping in cleanliness. You would think its a nice place bc it's in a nice residential area but nope. Get it together UmC and don't be soooo cheap.Wife and I went for lunch (10 Jan 13), the place was empty except for a few workmen servicing the surveillance cameras. We ordered soup (chicken pot pie soup) and a club sandwich. The soup was very good...the sandwich was fair. Definitely  not 'piled high' with ingredients. The service was very good and the place is big and nicely decorated. One can sit at the bar or a seperate dining room for the kiddies.As Astro, the family dog on "The Jetson's" once said, "Ruh roh, Rorge!"... Sadly, things are not good at Memphis.

I've been a loyal MCB and Mike Mills fan for well over a decade, and I've been regularly eating at various locations of the popular BBQ restaurant in Vegas for at least that long. My recent trip back this week for what was once divine, heavenly BBQ shattered my perception of a longtime favorite. 

The place was deserted on a Tuesday night, and unfortunately, now I know why... 

God help us all, the BBQ at MCB was NOT good on this visit... And after reading recent Yelp reviews, it appears that management is allowing the once high "Mills" standards to fall. The pork was greasy, stringy, not very flavorful, and not very smoky. The ribs were better than the pork, but still not what they used to be. Stellar meat, no longer...

Service was slow and distracted, at best. Our server even felt so comfortable that he sat at another customer's table for 10 minutes or so, chatting.

My usual sides of turnip greens and red beans and rice have been reduced from a decent size bowl to a tiny cup, but at least they were still delicious, as were the rolls and cinnamon butter.

Mike, if you're listening, get your ass back to Vegas and crack the whip. The Rainbow location has already closed... It would TRULY be a shame to see MCB go down in flamesGood service.Coffee hot.Had the breakfast burrito.Was ok.Beans were a little dry.Rice was ok.Wife had the American Chilaquiles.Was scrambled egg whites on top of tortiila chips.No flavor.Would go back but we would order something else.We went to Strings with another couple for dinner, and I must say that this time was not as enjoyable as my previous ventures here.  In large part that may be because on this occasion I opted for a different entree than Veal Marsala, that had always been consistently excellent.  But a few other prepared dishes were slightly off form, as well.  As luck would have it, this tends to happen whenever I try to introduce friends to a restaurant whose praises I have sung.

The Garlic Bread was as good or better than ever.  In Las Vegas from my dining experiences thus far, only the Garlic Bread at Lavo reaches this level of buttery and garlicky goodness.  You could press a hot slice and liquid would ooze out of it.  By night's end my small group finished three baskets.

Another great dish once again was Stuffed Mushrooms.  This appetizer consisted of button mushrooms stuffed with some Pesto and gooey cheese, and topped by an ample quantity of mellow Marinara Sauce and Parmesan splinters.  Delicious!  I hardly noticed the Pesto flavor, which for me was a good thing, because I am not a Pesto aficiando.

Meals come with Minestrone Soup or salad, but I got both since my wife is known as Veggie Hater for a reason.  The homemade Minestrone Soup had very good, mildly spicy broth but contained overcooked cabbage.  Included potatoes, carrots, zucchini, and onions were fine.  And, my Caesar Salad (no extra charge for a Caesar!) was fairly good, with a creamy Caesar Dressing.

My entree of Veal Picatta was made with a sauce that was white wine-based, lemony, and punctuated by capers.  It was served with Roasted Potatoes and fresh vegetables, and appeared to be creamy, floury, and somewhat unusual looking.  But, it tasted good with the thinly pounded veal--only not as remarkable as the Marsala Sauce I had previously sampled here.  Portions were good sized but the asparagus spears on my plate were very thin, a rough variety, and somewhat burned.  And, uncharacteristically, the Roasted Potatoes were underdone on the inside and slightly burned on the outside.

Desserts here are first rate.  While others at my table enjoyed an Exotic Bombe and Tiramisu, I had more run-of-the-mill Spumoni, which, though, was good and refreshing.

Service was friendly, fast, and efficient; and the informal trattoria ambiance was nice.  It was a 3-1/2-star experience!Looking for vintage or brand name clothing and don't mind used or slightly worn?  You should stop by this place and check it out.  They have everything from Gucci to Alexander McQueen, so it's worth coming in just to browse or sell.
Great place to sell your brand name clothing, purses, wallets, shoes, hats, etc.  I found this place on Google when I wanted to sell my clothes (I was spring cleaning).  I recently brought my purses there and received a low but fair price for two out of ten purses I brought in.  They are very picky with everything including shoes and clothes.  They have two options: cash or trade, and it's up to you when you get to the cashier which way you want to go.  I ended up trading today for a Coach wallet to match my brand new purse.  The first time I came in I traded for a slightly used Coach bag, too, only paying 10 bucks out of pocket and I traded 4 blouses for it.  

I'll probably continue doing business with them when it's time to clean the closet.  Instead of donating most of it, I can make some cash back even if it's a small amount.  Try it out--you never know how much you can make from cleaning your closet!Great Kalbi plate!!!! These short ribs are marinated well. Awesome flavor. The Teriyaki plates are pretty good too,  the sauce needs a little sweetness, I think. The macaroni salad is the bomb. I like this place, good food for a good price. I tried the chicken wings...not worth it.  The appetizers are not that good and cost almost as much as a plate. Stick to the combination plates.First time since they changed from Callaway.  They aren't as friendly as old employees. I was a little confused from new set up and took them a bit for them to help. Still my favorite location to hit some balls after a long day.Service is great, but honestly the mexican food here is over rated. I came here a year ago, I must have still been drunk and thought the food was great, the next time I came I was sober and did not like the food that much.. They have great service, and make tortillas there.. That was cool..The egg-themed breakfast joints in Vegas tend to blend together after a while, and while the Cracked Egg is very good, there's nothing terribly distinctive about it either.

We came on a Saturday morning about 10 a.m., so it was prime time, but despite that, we were seated within five minutes. The service was great, with someone taking our drink orders right away and the waitress following up soon thereafter. The menu covers the basics -- omelets, scrambles, skillets and griddle items -- with everything customizable to your liking.

Our drinks came out promptly, and so did the coffee cake that came with my girlfriend's scramble. You'll read about this coffee cake in other Yelpers' reviews, and with good reason: It's warm, soft, slightly gooey, and positively designed to make you crave coffee, as good coffee cake should.

The rest of our food was made perfectly to order, and while not the greatest food ever, definitely solid. The seasoned potatoes could have been a bit more seasoned, but then again, I compare all to the Egg & I's potatoes, so ... sorry, Cracked Egg. ;) Our water and coffee were kept filled and our check came promptly.

Because I live on the opposite side of the valley from the Cracked Egg, I probably wouldn't seek it out again (as other comparable venues such as Eggworks are closer), but if I was in the neighborhood one morning? Sure!Eh, it's Home Depot. As Home Depots go, this is neither the best nor worst to have ever existed. 

If you do end up going, they'll probably have what you need at the price of having to search for quite a while  (no one is ever really helpful at Home Depot, are they?) amidst more people than you'd probably like to deal with. Such is life.

This location is particularly notable for having way, way more of those guys who try to come home with you every time you go to Home Depot than any other Home Depot I've ever been to. That's a minus one.

Two stars.Went here last night to meet some friends for the Rock N' Roll Wine event they were having......  The three stars are for the decor and ambiance ONLY......  The staff.....?  well...... it appeared they were either all in sync with their "time" of the month and clearly NOT too happy about it, or, they were simply unhappy about the corncob that somehow lodged itself into their a@#*....either way, did not make for very friendly treatment..... that being said, we ordered a few appetizers which clearly we should have left in the kitchen..... ordered the fondue..... great little pot of cheese but it was too bad they didn't have time to run down to Smith's and buy more things to actually dip into the cheese..... obviously they ran out of stuff and decided to throw a bunch of the garnish from the bar onto the plate..... guess they figured, "hey, you're dipping it in cheese anyway....."..... all together, there were about 5 grapes, 3 slices of apple, 2 or 3 florrets of cauliflower and broccoli and 4 cubes of cornbread.....  kind of bargain for $20 wouldn't you say.....  we also ordered satay and received 2 small pieces of chicken and 2 pieces of beef...... and, as a final slap in the face..... it wasn't at all appetizing..... at least nothing to write home about.....  the best part of the entire evening was the open bar for ladies from 9 - 10.....    they had a DJ who played 30 second snippets of every song.... just when you were getting in to one, it stopped and another came on..... got a bit discumbobulating......  
Again, it gets three stars for the ceiling treatment, the lighting over the bar and the extremely cool tile mosaic chairs at the front door......Well, we were downtown last weekend and happened to be hungry at an odd hour due to a very late breakfast that morning and so immediately I thought "Hey, lets go to Pizzeria Bianco. They can't possibly have a wait for a table at 2:30 pm on a Friday." Well, turns out they did but fortunately we only had to stand out in the 100 degree sunshine for 15 minutes or so. We've actually attempted to eat here a few other times over the years but when the wait time was quoted as 2 - 3 hours we moved on to dine somewhere else. So, was this pizza worth the wait you ask? Yes, it was absolutely worth a 15 minute wait. But no meal is worth a 3 hour wait. I think it's really silly that they don't serve pizza out on the patio or next door in the wine bar or just take reservations... its sort of a power play that they make people wait around for so long like that. I just don't get it.

Anyway, I was surprised that the menu didn't have a whole lot of options. I really felt like a red sauce so that cut our choices down to three pizzas. I opted for the Margherita since that is a nice classic but of course hubby wanted some kind of meat so we added sausage. That was a very good decision since the sausage was absolutely delicious. We both loved the pizza and it was just the right amount of food for the two of us. Hubby didn't feel like it was worth the $18 but that is about what you would pay at other non-chain artisan pizza places that offer that neapolitan style pizza so I was fine with it. Our service was ok though a bit rushed. By the time we were done eating there were a few empty tables so I didn't really see why it was necessary to take our plates away immediately after my last bite (seriously, I was still chewing) and then bring the check immediately afterwards without asking if we wanted anything else. I guess that is just how they do things there.

I'm glad I went since it is such a Phoenix landmark but I don't really see any reason to return.On rare cold day in Phoenix it actually was almost empty , but quality was great as usual very thin crust pizza with fresh ingredients, but after last pizza with olive oil that i actually has to remove with napkins it destroyed all experience and drop rate to 3 stars at bestLet me preface this review by saying that I am not a coffee person. I would like to be a coffee person, but whenever I drink coffee I experience unfortunate side effects like running as fast as I can and spinning around in wheelie chairs. So when I go to a coffee house, I get the chai, review off that, and ask any accomplices I may have brought what they thought of the coffee. This time I brought my mom, and she said the coffee was "very smooth." Whatever that means.

The chai, on the other hand, was "very bland" by my own standards. It was not spicy or sweet, and possibly a little bitter (what? How can chai be bitter? I don't know...). The other teas are good, though, and they have an nice variety to choose from. 

I will probably keep going and sipping tea, because the new building is just so darn cool and I would love to spend an afternoon there. The atmosphere is nice and it is a great place to meet a friend. I think I could easily relax in Lux for a couple of hours and enjoy a lovely life talk with anyone who passes by!The hotel is dark and dumpy while the food and drink options are slim pickings, but that isn't really why anyone goes here - is it?  Free January trips to the top for locals is pretty much all you need to know and with excellent views and a light crowd I'd recommend everyone do it at least once - touristy for sure, but far cheaper (and taller, and less of a hassle) than the Seattle Space Needle or the St. Louis Arch.As a bar I found Red Square to be a bit of a disappointment.
They rock hard on the decor and I give them props for that.  The location is fair and the service was ok but not memorable.  The have Guiness from in bottles, for $8.  It is Vegas, but still.
For their mixed drinks they have some fairly solid ones but nothing that knocked me off my feet.
You really can find better places to go in Vegas.  It is fine to stop by after dinner but I would recommend one drink and then head off somewhere else.
The straight-Russian themed bar/restaurant.
What's good-mixed drinks, having money
The slap-not a great crowd and not great to hang around.Unfortunately, Emeril isn't here every night cooking the dishes himself, because if he were, I believe MY DISH would have LOOKED and TASTED ALOT better than it did...
...THAT being said-- I expected a heck of a lot more than what I got out of the evening....ESPECIALLY at the $$$$ u pay....
More variety of seafood choices on the menu would be nice..i mean, it IS a so-called "FISH HOUSE"!!
Wait staff was...interesting.  DO NOT SIT right there in front of the wait booth...unless you want to be stared at the whole night and approached constantly..The server we finally got, ended up seeing him only 2 times, then he disappeared and some other man comes up for the rest of the evening--with no explanation on who/what/where/why...i hate that... 4 men delivered our food to the table without the benefit of the waiter who took the order and who knew what each of us ordered being there..so there was some confusion on their part..this I do not like either..I PROMISE I saw one of the men poke his finger in one of the dishes!!! I do NOT take too kindly to people hovering over and talking over my food and holding it too long. Just bring the food out, put it in front of me STAT and walk away.Am I a wimp?

I guess I just don't like it when the bottom of my burger bun is soaked with COW BLOOD.

i asked for my kobe burger to be cooked medium. last time i checked, "medium" meant slightly pink.. not bloody enough to soak my burger bun.

i def enjoyed the cooked areas of my burger but not the center. i only ate 75% of my burger. i did not send it back because i'm a wimp and didn't want anyone to spit on it.

my other friend who ordered medium also got rare.

order more well done than you usually do and you should be fine.About 3.5 stars but not really worth the money. I had the Kobe Burger $17 and fries $3. Cheese Cake Factory Kobe was better!!!Food was great. My husband and I split the house salad and the barbecue burger. He ordered medium and we got well done. He was upset....I was happy. Kids meal was two sliders my son enjoyed it and after a bite to inspect quality wink wink it was also a winner in my book. Great ice tea too. 

Service was random and slow. We had two servers during our meal. The second one totally forgot us and left us hanging once our food arrived. I would go back and give it another try when we return to Vegas because the house salad was so good.  Everyone has an off day right?

Three stars because of the mixed up order and less than great service.First off, I love the decor and the mix of music.  I tried to get our server to give me their play list.  Apparently, Bobby Flay as some music company in NYC that compiles the mix and puts it into an iPod and ships it to each of his restaurants regularly.  hmm, how do I intercept that shipment .... 

As for the food.  I've been here both for dinner and Sunday brunch.  The food was good, but maybe I'm just not the TexMex kinda gal.  The brunch basket was really yummy, I wanted to take that with me.  The grits were also really good.  Actually, if I had just the bread basket and the grits I would have been just fine.  The goat cheese queso fundido was also fabulous.  Just make sure you don't let it cool down too much before you dive in.  I was really hung over, so the cactus pear ice tea with the liquid sugar was my poison of choice.  The spicy chicken + sweet potato hash was good, but I don't see me craving it.  Same with my dinner selection on a previous visit.  I ordered the New Mexican Spice Rubber Pork Tenderloin, it was good, but not very memorable.There's a reason this review is rated at three stars -- and it's not because of the food. 

We've been going to both LLX locations quite a while, both of them since they've opened in their respective locations really.  This was the first time that we've ordered take-out.

It being a Friday, I had to order from the Williamson St. location, which does takeout on Friday and Saturday; the Atwood location does it the rest of the week.  Ok so far, even though it's a bit silly to have to remember where to order from.

We ordered a pair of vegetarian eggrolls, khua mee with tofu, and the mango curry -- this last being perhaps my favorite of their many excellent curries.  I was told that it would be 30-45 minutes for the delivery, so the wife and I settled down to a game of Scrabble.

The order arrived more than 90 minutes later. At the door, the delivery guy quoted the total at a dollar more than they did on the phone, but that's his loss as it only reduced his tip by the same amount. (or did it?).  The food was hot and we were itching to dig in.

The eggrolls, normally fat and crispy in the restaurant, arrived somewhere between damp and soggy.  Still tasty, but disappointing when one is looking forward to the crisp.

The khua mee was good, though not great -- largely I think because they jammed the entire order into a takeout container one size too small and so most of the noodles emerged broken.

And the mango curry?  No way to know, because they sent pineapple curry instead, though that was excellent as always.  I just finished the leftovers, re-heated as my lunch.  Their curries are even better the second day.

The take-out operation is clearly the problem. To get the orders straight, to avoid funny stuff about the order total between the phone and the door, and to get the packaging right, perhaps they should consider running the take-out from one location only, seven nights a week. 

Will we continue to eat at LLX? Definitely.  Will we continue to order take-out from them?  Yes, but only because the food is that good and because Madison is radically deficient in decent delivered food.  But they're only getting a couple of more chances at the take-out side of things.Disappointed. Probably a comfort food place reminding of your mom's omelet? Sadly, it didn't appeal to me. But I wouldn't say it's bad. Just an okay place. Truly believe this place is overrated.Time has not treated you well, Dotty.  Almost 20 years ago in college (god that sounds that a long time ago), I visited Dotty's when it was located on Regent St.  A small place that delivered an absolutely amazing burger.  I still remember it to this day.  Fast forward to today and Dotty's is not even close to what it once was.  Yes, it still carries a strong brand recognition in Madison but let's face it, the burger scene in Madison is hyper competitive and there are at least 7 other places that produce a superior sandwich.  Way too much sauce, the meat lacked flavor and didn't appear to be hand pattied the way they once were. What once was is now very pedestrian and unerwhelming.  Sure, they will attract the people that stroll by on their way to a Kohl Center event but won't be attracting me anytime soon.LOTS OF VEGETARIAN BAR FOOD!!!!

Nice place to hang out w/ a large group.  Food is good, not awesome.  Service is pretty good.  Decent drinks ($5).  Good beers.  A little overpriced, but overall you will have a good time with many coworkers or friends.  Good place to watch a game, but they are not open on Sundays.

The veggie ruben is my personal fav although a close second is the California fiesta.Not bad for a breakfast place.  We had a large group of 10, and they easily accomodated us and did not care when we grabbed two more chairs off a nearby table when two more showed up.  I thought a few of their menu items were definitely original, such as the bacon stuffed waffles and some of their crepes.  I ordered the banana crepes and left stuffed and satisfied.  It was definitely enough food.  The price was about what you'd expect to pay- I'm trying to find a cheaper breakfast place that serves good food.  The service was a little slow.  We probably waited at least 30 minutes if not more for our food.  I was confused on payment- if you pay in cash, you have to pay up front and that was not explained when we got our checks.  Overall, I would try this place again.I don't go to the Rainforest Cafe for me, I do it for the kids. They love it there. We went there for a little trip to get out of the house for the day ( and If we are out of the house it also means I can't start the painting project I am supposed to do and it will have to wait until next weekend). 
Anyway, We get there and the hostess tried to put us right next to the door so we asked for another table. They put us next to an aquarium which was good for me because the kids left me alone, but bad for the fish because the didn't leave them alone. 
I got a hamburger with guacamole. the wife had an appetizer. the boy had two mini hot dogs and the girl had a pizza. the kids meals were the right size for them and my hamburger was pretty good.First day stay: check in was simple,line was short which made it a lot easier. My room was decent but I've seen better for the same price. Shops were the same high class shops that normal people like me don't shop at. My room had a refridge but was stuff with overpriced things like soda and such. If you ask them they will bring up a empty fridge for you.
Second day: I tried their tub. It was ok. Paris suite was much better you could fit someone else In the tub. Not as relaxing as Paris hotel. I probably had jets in em if I paid more for my room. Bellagio was a little too high class for my taste but it was an ok experience.Bellagio has a classy and elegant appeal. The decor throughout the whole entire hotel is absolutely gorgeous and intriguing.  From the minute you arrive, your jaws would drop. That is if you have never been to Vegas and this is your first time seeing this place. It is definitely one amazing hotel in terms of decor, but it does not deserve a five star rating because  the service was not up to par and our rooms were just not worth what we paid for.

I came here recently with a group of girls for one of my friend's birthday celebration. We decided to splurge and made reservations for two nights here. We even caught a limo from the airport to Bellagio.  We arrived on a Friday night around 8:30pm and we were in absolute hurry to check- in to our room. The bell man was getting ready to help us with our luggage until we decided to ask him how long it will take before we get our luggage if he were to help us with them. He said the soonest would be an hour. That was way too long for us giving we were eager to check- in and begin our night in Vegas. We decided to pass and helped ourselves with our luggage. 

From the beginning we were disappointed because it took about half hour before we got keys to our rooms. To make matters worse, they made a mistake with one of our reservations and no longer had rooms available with two queen size bed, which was what we had asked for. We didn't feel like fussing over it, so we settled for whatever they had, a king size bed. They offered to bring in a folded twin size bed for us, however and told us our room will be upgraded.

When we got to our room, we were quite disappointed. The room was small and the decor wasn't anything special whatsoever. It had a bit of an old fashion design to it and the bathroom was nothing to rave about. If our room was an upgrade, why on earth did we not even get a Jacuzzi? We had an average size tub, his and her sinks and a shower stall. There was one rob hanging in the closet and not enough towels for us to use in the bathroom. We just weren't satisfied with what we had received at all. We simply felt ripped- off. The cost per night at Bellagio is not cheap. The best part about our stay here was the gorgeous view our room offered.

Despite our discontent over our stay, Bellagio is a great place to explore while visiting Vegas because inside and out, it truly is absolutely beautiful. They have great shops for those who like to shop and are into designer brands, a casino for people who like to gamble, bars and lounge areas, a nightclub for some late night dancing and other amenities we all would love to enjoy. I personally would visit Bellagio again to enjoy the amenities this place offers (they also have an all you can eat buffet I have yet to try), but I wouldn't want to stay here again. Their prices are high (which is fine if they offered outstanding service), service is average, and it's simply way too busy and crowded for me to enjoy staying overnight.The room was small, but clean and they took a lot of walking to get to from the elvator. Bathroom was nice and clean as well. The theme itself isn't bad, it felt more targeted to the under 30 crowd and families. Has a floor of arcade games and attractions and a roller coaster, but not as kiddish as circus circus or Excalibur. 

 NYNY lacks any decent shopping, and it's the only hotel on the strip with no buffet (which i don't care about since I went to the bellagio one). It's too far on the side of the strip, and not the good side. Honestly if you're staying in Vegas for 1 or two nights I'd rather just get the cheapest room possible and spend the money elsewhere, since really you will only be sleeping there. I probably complaining because we paid too much for memorial day weekend, it wasn't a bad expereience nor was it great - just not worth the money. IMO if you want to stay at a decent hotel I'd spend a little more OR suck it up and spend a lot less on sleeping and more on fun!dislike the area of the lower floor food court, very slippery. the ride was amazing! kinda sad they dont have that many rides. i love the $5 min rouletteStay here with my wife for 2 nights over a birthday weekend.  The views were great but the room was so hot even after calling for maintenance.  Not sure for the price I would recommend it to anyone.  Casino is small but nice.  Location on strip is good.Price were decent especially on a busy weekend when I went. The room were nice and clean. The only problem I had was room service. It took them over two hours to get to get clean towels.. Imagine if I had a hot rendezvous in another hotel and I couldn't dry myself..I have been to this hotel many times, but recently stayed there for my first time. The rooms are not as fabulous as I anticipated. They just didn't seem that clean. 

This hotel seems to be busy at all hours of the day and night. It's expensive and there really are no breaks at this hotel. 

The Eiffel Tower ride was awesome as the view of the strip was amazing. You can see the airport as well.On my most recent and likely last (for awhile) Vegas trip, my intentions were to eat at some top-notch restaurants...We stayed at the Hard Rock and headed to Nobu...

Nobu was on a Friday night about 8:30pm after being at the Ditch Day Pool Party at the Palms all day...needless to say we were hungry!

Very vibrant atmosphere and great for a starter to the nights activities...

Our first try was the Washu Beef tataki style which we ordered rare...FABULOUS!!

Then onto the Yellowtail sashimi with jalapeno (whoever was the first to pair these two is a genius) you can never go wrong with yellow-tail

Rolls and Sushi were fresh and good...the restaurant was packed and I can see why...would definitely go againI'll keep it short, nice hotel for the price and great pool area. Close to all the good stuff.I took my best friend here the night before his wedding. We were set to go somewhere else but the guy at the cab stand suggested here instead. 

Well. 

The place is dark. I mean, DARK. We stumbled around for a bit trying to find a spot to sit. It was a Friday night and still relatively early so it wasn't too crowded... which was a bummer because I would have enjoyed feeling my way, if you know what I mean. 

We weren't in our seats 2 minutes before the vultures began descending. 

I dubbed the first girl "Skeletor", not because of how rail thin she was, but because her cheeks were so sunken in, she looked like a toothless crack whore. I kid you not. Plus she looked to be about 50. I mean, the place was dark, but not SO dark that we couldn't tell she was in no way attractive. We immediately began to question the steep cover charge. 

Let me interrupt myself here to comment on the cover charge. $50 a person! We later found out from a friendly girl that they check your ID's first so they know if you're an out-of-towner. Locals don't get hit with the cover charge. Shame on you for that, SR. 

Back to the girls. Meh. Really. I can appreciate a lovely lady but we had to turn away girl after girl because of one thing or another. Like, they had great boobs but no butt. Or a great butt and no boobs. Perhaps that's why it is so dang dark in this place? So discerning people can't be quite so... discerning? 

Really, we were not impressed at all. Until...

My friend went to use the bathroom. While he was in there, I spotted HER. I had to get up out of my seat and get her attention. She was the ONE girl who had "the entire package" and I knew my BFF would approve. She waited patiently for my friend to come back. When he did and saw her, I knew I picked the right girl.  

She was the only one we picked to dance for us that night. And she DID NOT disappoint. She is the ONLY reason this place gets the 3 stars from me. 

It was all made worth it when we returned to our hotel and my friend's wife-to-be complained how my friend was smeared in lipstick and glitter from head to toe. She asked him to take a shower right away because "he smelled like cheap booze and cheap women". 

Hey!! Those women were NOT cheap!!Meh.

Came here on a whim one late Vegas night.

My club sandwich was a little heavy on the mayo and while the bacon wasn't bad (is there such thing?) it was clearly of the microwaveable variety.  I'm not exactly complaining because I definitely ate the whole thing with a quickness but honestly.. in a place filled with women, I would have thought that sandwiches would be their specialty or something (kidding).Every time I go to Vegas, I try to sleep in a different hotel. This time around, was the MGM. I arrived in Vegas with my boyfriend around 9am on a Saturday morning. With check-in not being until 3pm, I was crossing my fingers that our room was ready and we could check in early because I was in need of a nap. The check in line was pretty long, but moved fast. My boyfriend and I stayed in the Executive King suite on the 9th floor, for two nights:

Pros: 
-Check in line went pretty quick, and the staff was very friendly and helpful
-Was able to check in early without a problem
-Room was very clean 
-No noise from other rooms
-Quick, express check out on kiosks in the lobby

Cons:
- I was asked if I wanted a smoking room upon checking in, and I said yes, and the desk clerk did not assign me one like promised
-The maid threw away food I had left on the desk, which looked clearly edible and untouched
-Walking to the pool was a journey
-They held $200 on my debit card because I did not have a credit card for the duration of my stay
-Buffet was mediocre 


Overall, the trip was successful. Don't forget to check out Wet Republic!I'm never one to bitch about a hotel. I stayed in one with bullet holes in the ceiling in San Jose once. But I had to give this one 3 stars. First of all, if its your first time in Vegas and you don't know how to utilize the back roads, good luck being able to get in from the strip. Thankfully, this was my 3rd time in Vegas and I knew to enter behind the hotel (take Koval to Ida). Once you're in the parking garage, you have to take an elevator down, walk past the dog piss area, threw a hallway, across traffic, into a door, to go up another elevator. (hold on let me take a breath....okay.) Now when you get off the elevator, (did i mention you're still dragging your luggage?) walk threw the shops, then the casino, all the way practically to the front door, and then walk through the maze of ropes to the front desk. Luckily I didn't have such a long wait as some of my fellow Yelpers did. Maybe 3 minutes. The guy was quick. We booked on the website (deluxe room for $28) and he got us right on our way. Right on our way back to trekking through the Andes. Hope you brought water and Chex mix. Okay so we were in Tower 5 which is back the way you came through the casino, maybe halfway back the way you came. We were on the 11th floor, so we took the elevators up and when you step off, brace yourself. You will SWEAR you are in The Shining. Long, dark hallways. We had to walk down the first hallway, make a right, and then go all the way down another hallway to find our room. MEMORIZE this because when you're drunk later on theres no fucking way you will find your way back to your room. Once we got in, I was pleasantly surprised. The room was pretty nice. The view SUCKED. Theres just the Flamingo next door, and if you really peak around you can catch a glimpse of the Cosmopolitan. Theres no comforter on the bed! like WTF! its just a bunch of sheets. the sink had drain issues. The most awesome part: YOU CAN HEAR EVERYTHING. After I got dressed up like a hooker in true Vegas fashion, I was leaving to go to the Mirage (Pitbulls birthday party...VIP baby), I heard a guy puking in his room. My loud self of course had to yell: "its only 9pm you pussy get back out there!!!"

So yes the hotel is a big dodgy. But if you only come to Vegas to sit in your hotel and stay in the one casino, get the hell out of Vegas and go to where I'm from. In Central Cali theres 4 indian casinos within an hour from me thats just fine for that. But I still drive 6 hours to Vegas to be out and about!! The amazing thing about this place is you're right in the middle of the action! You got Caesar's Palace, The Mirage, The Bellagio, Treasure Island, Flamingo, O'sheas, Harrahs...EVERYTHING in walking distance. Even in heals you will still survive!!I was so excited to try the place because walking by the restaurant, the smell of the food wafting out of the restaurant smelled divine and I was craving fish. The atmosphere is quite cozy and chic. It is quite busy so service wasn't terrible but not as good as it could've been. 

I ordered the Escargots de Bourgogne and the Skate Wing. I had not had escargot in a really long time, so I HAD to try it but it was quite a disappointment. The garlic herb sauce for the escargot was extremely buttery to the point where I could feel the butter after wiping my mouth. Definitely not appealing. And the escargot was a bit on the chewy side. When the skate wing arrived the aroma was intoxicating. The texture was very light (similar to a tilapia type fish) and the flavors wasn't too overwhelming. I was not a fan of the capers (a bit on the tart side which was a little off putting with the dish) that came with the fish. The chips (made in-house) were extremely de-lish! Probably would buy a whole bag if I could.

For fish, this place is fantastic. Great atmosphere. Would definitely want to go back to try some other dishes as I'm a huge fan of french cuisine.The music at V Bar is usually hip hop and it's never too crowded.  I would say V Bar is a secondary destination for those that either couldn't get into Tao or didn't want to wait in line any longer.  I usually go there to pre-game or support the DJ.  It's a good-sized lounge and the bar is nearly the length of the room.

There is a dress code but if you're out on a weekend, then you should be in character already.  Not the greatest place to conduct business, but transactions can be made--especially after 2am.There must be places in Vegas that'll serve you a large, well-made Sunday brunch without the half hour wait we had here -- which, thanks to the multiplicative powers of I-15 traffic, probably delayed our arrival home a hour and a half. Still, the queue aside, there was little to fault. My bacon and eggs were very satisfying, and the third of someone's Joe's Special I ended up having was nearly as good. Coffee was drinkable, near Starbucks quality (that's sort of a compliment).This place brings back fond memories for me. When I was a kid, my dad and all his guy friends would meet for breakfast at the Peppermill the first or last Saturday of the month. It was my first experience of being out with the guys, feeling cool and I wish I could bring back those days. 

I'm here to say that it hasn't changed all that much. The waitresses are still wearing shiny nylons, but they are a lot younger than I remember, which is definitely a good thing. The food is good, the portion sizes are GIANT and you could easily order breakfast and share it with another friend or significant other. 

The service here was very good. Coffee cups were never empty, our waitress checked with us numerous times throughout the meal and they even had a cute gal come around and take your picture, which obviously means she comes back 12 minutes later while you have hash browns and eggs all over yourself asking "Wanna buy your photos? 2 for $29.99 or one for $14.50.") That's not such a bargain hun.

Peppermill is a much better option that the hotel buffet, which at the Wynn (where we always stay) would have been roughly $35 a piece.I did not like this hotel. I was tired when I arrived. Desk clerk told me to go outside and check my suitcase. Was not allowed to check in until well after 4pm and I had reservations!

My room was pretty far from the front, but that was ok.  

The slots machines were pretty nice.

They have a nice cafe / grill area.I found myself staying at the vast pinkness known as the Flamingo during my most recent trip to Vegas. As a hater of resort fees and spending more than I need to for a conveniently located place to occasionally sleep, I'm a fan of the Harrah's casinos in this area, but had never found the opportunity to stay here until now. 

We arrived shortly after 4pm to check in (because paying to check in early would have defeated the purpose of staying in a cheap hotel in the first place) and bypassed the line by using the express check in kiosks. Seriously, who are these suckaz not doing this? The line was gigantic, yet nobody was using these things. I mean, you guys know they're probably not going to give you a free upgrade on a Saturday, right? So within two minutes we were done with check in. It was beautiful. 

We quickly made our way to our room. I must say, these rooms are definitely a bit smaller than the ones at Bally's or Harrah's. The bathrooms were also a bit more cramped than those two and could have used a fresh coat of paint. We had no complaints about the beds, but there was something weird about the pillows. They were perhaps a bit too puffy. Not a dealbreaker, but you know. 

I dug the casino itself. It was much easier to get in and out than it is at Bally's or Harrah's (but still kind of a maze compared to my beloved but dearly departed Bill's Gamblin' Hall and Saloon. DON'T GET ME STARTED ON THAT TRAVESTY). I got copious amounts of free wine while winning money playing video poker, always a plus. The garden area is a nice escape from the usual casino-ness. The pool wasn't open this time around, but I've been there before and had a very good time. 

Overall, my stay here was quite pleasant. However, I'm giving it three stars because if given the choice between the Flamingo or Bally's or Harrah's, I would choose the latter two every time.Best parts of the Flamingo:
-middle of the strip--great location
-clean rooms
-decent price
-the flamingo habitat (wonder if it's humane, but...)

Bad part of the Flamingo:
-awful smell in the lobby/casino that smells like air freshener mixed with cigarettes and vomit
-the elevators don't work very well
-they messed up our bill when we checked in which started things off in a really frustrating way
-unprofessional desk staffThe price is good and there's a good variety of places to eat right in the hotel. Staff was also nice.

I knocked 2 stars down though because whenever we (fiancé and I) tried to go to the elevators to get to our hotel room we would constantly get harassed by people/workers standing in front of the elevators. They were very aggressive promising free shows, dinners etc., and they wouldn't take "not interested," for an answer. This happened almost every time we had to go to our room. It started to get extremely irritating. Here's a tip, when they ask, "how long are you in town?" Just say you're leaving in a few hours. That's the only way we were able to get them to leave us alone.Nice, clean friendly hotel. 3 Starbucks! Holy shiz. 

The pool is foul dirty and the guys at the bar are rude. The pool is oily with trash floating in it. 

The one thing that really irked me was the time share people all over the hotel. They are aggressive and rude. I don't care what they're offering, I'm not a dog don't yell at me like one.We stayed here in Jan 2012. Our rooms were not in the main building, but were clean and tidy. The breakfast was ok and you can each as much as you like, if you are that way inclined. Yes it involves a lot of walking, but what do you expect for such a large hotel. You have to pass all the slot machines and gambling tables to get anywhere, but I don't really gable, so was not enticed into doing do. We arranged a helicopter flight up to the Grand Canyon from within the hotel, and this is a must. Overall an enjoyable hotel.My girlfriend and I have been to the Craftsteak at MGM Foxwoods a number of times prior to it closing and I would give that location 5 stars. Our experience here wasn't as enjoyable.

We decided to give it a try Wednesday night. Having looked on opentable the day or so prior, it seemed like there were plenty of times available so I didn't bother making a reservation. When we arrived at 8:15, we were told the soonest we could be seated was 9:30.We decided to look elsewhere to eat. While doing so, out of curiosity I decided to take a peak at my opentable app and was able to book a reservation at 8:45, which caused us some confusion. Why couldn't they have booked this reservation at the hostess desk? We show back up at 8:45, were seated within a minute, and walked by several open tables at the bar which we specificied earlier would have been fine. Kind of left a bad taste in our mouths to start. 

Every time we've gone to Craftsteak at Foxwoods, we'd share the wagyu ribeye and it was easily the best steak I've ever had, every time. Worth every penny of the $100+. We ordered what we assumed was the same waygu ribeye, but it was unmistakably different. It was the leanest ribeye I've ever had, from the Texas Roadhouse to Grill 32 Boston. If I was told it was a sirloin, I'd think yeah this pretty good...for a sirloin.

The Foxwood's steak was cut to be shared and the marbleization was so extensive the pieces would fall apart as you lifted it, and those smaller pieces would melt in your mouth. A knife was not needed. 

I did some research, finding the Craftsteak at Foxwoods menu PDF, even though they closed: http://www.foxwoods.com/uploadedFiles/Pages/Dine/craftsteak_menu.pdf. They were both 14 oz wagyu ribeyes, but the one at Foxwoods specifies the grade (8) and the farm (Sher Ranch, Australia), and was also $134 vs the $105. We were told by the manager they get their meat from the same farm as the other locations. I didn't have these details at the time, but it didn't matter, it was not comparable. The price different is my only objective evidence of these steaks being of different grades and/or from a different ranch.

What saved the rating was the service. We voiced our confusion and slight dissatisfaction, and they were more than willing to replace it but we declined. To our surprise, they comped the steak which was shocking considering the price.We went on a Saturday night as part of a bachelorette party.  We were seated promptly, they brought out their fantastic ebi bread which is baked there in their own bakery, and we were all set to go.  

Several of us ordered the Steak Frites, which is basically a flatiron steak with a pile of french fries.  They were all cooked per taste, but in all, it was just a well cooked steak that you could get just about anywhere.  

One of us got the Pan-Roasted Trout in a browned butter sauce with almonds - that was amazing.  The trout was cooked perfectly and worth every penny.  It was very delicate and light, and fairly large portion.

Another got the bouchot mussels, which comes with frites.  Nice creamy white wine sauce that was good.  Large serving, too.  

I ordered the Leg of Lamb in garlic and thyme, which was also fantastic!  The lamb was so tender and juicy, cut off of the bone for you already, laid over a pile of vegetables.  

The service was a little slow - it took over an hour from when we ordered until our food was delivered.  Our server was nice.  However, one of the bussers spilled au jus all over a leather jacket and purse, which was a little bit of a downer.  

Of note, I'd been there before for the brunch menu, which is much more tastier than the dinner menu.  The famed chicken and waffles is exactly that - roasted chicken and waffles and I was not wow'ed by it.  The best dish was french toast made from brioche - a must try.

The reason Bouchon gets only 3 stars is b/c though it is very good food, I expected more from Mr Keller, especially for the price you pay and the hype that you hear.  There are many other restaurants in Vegas that you can get the similar quality of food, and only a few things stand out here.  Still, it's a must-do at least once in your life.It must have been an off day.

Yes, I was not in a healthy state to be eating my food but had my sore throat been gone, I'm sure I would have had the same reception to the French Toast before me. Petite, cinnamon, tart... a flavor combination I am not fond of. My other friend who was perfectly fine didn't seem to care for the toast either.

What I can assess is that the service was particularly slow that day. I felt like everyone around us was getting tended to but us. When I had my water refilled, the waiter unknowingly allowed all the condensation from the pitcher to drip down onto my pants. As far as the food, no one professed that their dish was out of this world and for that reason, I have to give it an A-OK rating.After reading many reviews and knowing the Vegas Strip restaurant scene all too well, I tempered my enthusiam for my visit.  Although I haven't been to Keller's restaurants in Napa i'm well aware of his reputation.  Bouchon Vegas certainly does not live up to my expectations of Keller.  It is, however, a perfectly respectable restaurant to enjoy a good, albeit, over-priced meal.  Upon arrival I was a little surprised at how big the restaurant is.  To me a bistro is by definition small.  I also didn't  care for the layout of the menu.  It was a little kitchy for me and very hard to read in a dark restaurant.  I started with Escargots à la Bourguignonne.  The snails were tender and well cooked but the dish lacked seasoning.  I also had a few bites of Salade de Cresson et d'Endives au Roquefort, Pommes et Noix.  This was a very nice salad, but just a salad.  I also tried the Beignets de Brandade de Morue.  Again, the dish lacked seasoning (which is tough to do with salt cod).  For dinner I went with the Steak "Bouchon".  I wanted to try something I had never eaten before but the dinner menu is pretty limited and slightly boring so I opted for the steak.  It was very good, but again, just a steak.  The rice that accompanied the steak was boring by itself, but combined with the sauce bordelaise it was quite nice, as was the celeriac lyonnaise.  I also tried the veal that was the special of the night.  It was cooked perfectly but overall very forgettable.  The table also shared some fries and mac n cheese.  The fries were very good.  The mac n cheese had good flavor but the mac was way overcooked.  By far the best part of the meal was the dessert specially prepared by the pastry chef for my companion's birthday.  It was a chocolate creme cake that was spectacular (and I don't even like cake).  Service was excellent.  Attentive but not over-baring.  I also appreciate that they pour beer at the right temperature and into proper stems.Fun place to have dinner with nice ambiance.  We were planning on staying for the club and didn't realize the restaurant basically is the club.  Are you kidding?  Its just a bar/restaurant.  Either way the clientele were creepy.  I can't imagine paying cover to get into this place.  My bud and I fled not long after eating.Nice set up. I didn't see anything I could live without though. All the stores are the same you would see at any other outlet shopping center.I don't really understand this place.  It seems like a cool lounge where you hang out and chat with friends, but the music is way too loud for that.  There isn't any space to dance or walk around and mingle.

I came in with a huge group, and we didn't fit anywhere.  Everyone was looking at us, we were in the way in so many different place.

We came for the coffee shot, and we all had it.  It was tasty.

They were quick to bring out our shots, and passed them all at the same time which was cool.I've been here twice, but am writing a review for my most recent trip to PURE, last Saturday.

Yikes - $8 for a tiny-ass bottle of Fiji water?  I don't THINK so!  And they won't serve you tap or any other kind of water, either, so make sure you don't overdo it here with the liquor at PURE.  

Luckily, we were able to crash a bachelor party in one of the reserved red velvet booths, where they had plenty of Grey Goose and bottled Fiji to go around, but if you aren't as lucky as we were, I'd say save your money and try a cooler place...

The patio on the top is nice, though.  You get a great view of the strip.If you are staying on the strip, it's kind of a pain to come out here. We took a cab on a Saturday afternoon and I was expecting it to be very lively but it was very mild. It was half filled and no one seemed to be in the spirit. Mainly couples and some groups of guys. The beer was so good though. The food was so rich nobody in our party felt good after wards. I honestly would have just been happy splitting one of their delicious pretzels.Very fun place, great for groups, a little hard to hear if on a date, but very lively and fully of the usualy Germna energy.  Very Similar to the Original in Munich, which I've been to a few times.Good German Music, good beer, good pretzels.  I have been a couple times now, and would recommend just sampling appetizers and beers.  I always rate german places based on the snitchel, and this one wasn't that good.  I think is was too light and baked, not fried.
--RibChampIt was okay, beer was great though. The food, they clam to be authentic German but the food was kinda authentic. I know some authentic German food takes time to cook so I understand the short cuts. However, I wouldn't mind waiting a little bit longer for a true authentic German dish. This is the reason for three stars. BUT, still go here, it is a lot of fun a good musicI was camped out by my favorite table, playing Sic Bo, at New York, New York so my family came to meet me here for dinner.  It was just average I think.  Nothing too exciting and nothing to get worked up about.  I had the capellini with tomatoes, basil and marinara.  The pasta was a smidge too al dente.  The hot chocolate was not too chocolatey.  If my family didn't join me for dinner I would've been happier with a Nathan's dog.3 stars. Food wasnt bad but it clearly didn't live up to the hype. Place was really dirty from floors to the tables but its not trying to be anything it isn't either. Staff was extremely friendly (may have influenced a few reviews). I had the jade chicken and the pollo diablo, both were average.I first heard about Chino Bandido on a Food Network show, and the fare sounded interesting. Mexican food with an Asian flare? Either horrible or awesome, right? 

Top Dog: Emerald Chicken - Brimming with the the flavors of green onions and ginger, this chicken was my favorite. I had it in a burrito, and immediately made me regret the other things I'd ordered.

Contendor: Jade Chicken - Interesting, but ultimately unsuccessful. It just tasted like someone put sriracha sauce on my tacos. Nah. Nothing special.

Surprising: Confusing order system - The system makes sense, but it takes a few minutes to figure out. They should just have newbies order at the counter with no paper. There's a whole matrix, and abbreviations, and about 30 options times four... It was surprising that it was so difficult to order.

Disappointing: Chile relleno - this was a bummer; chile rellenos are one of my faves, but this was a monstrosity; poor choice of cheeses, the batter was waaay too crunchy, not many seasonings. No thanks.

Overall, some good tastes, but room for improvement. Biggest improvement would be less grease. EVERYTHING was super greasy!  The fried rice was greasy, the beans were lardy, the food was oily, and the grease settled at the bottom of the foil container, getting the tortillas greasy and the rice greasier too!

I'd return, but I'd stick to the Emerald chicken.Per usual, I yelp everything before i give it a try. However, I was sorely disappointed with Bellagio's buffet. Nothing was particularly bad, its just that nothing was YUM. For $30+ a person I was expecting fairly decent food. The crab legs were super salty and everything else was bland and unmemorable. I can honestly say that I prefer the cheap Asian buffets over Bellagio's. As for the dessert selection, which could've been its saving grace since I have a major sweet tooth, it was also a huge let down. The only thing they did well was the creme brulee, hence the extra star.$24.99 for saturday brunch. 

The line was so long when we got to this buffet. The wait was probably 30+ minutes and it was crowded in the buffet area. 

They were serving lunch and breakfast, that's why I love BRUNCH!

They had some meat: Lamb and Prime Rib which were delicious and well moist but the Prime Rib was too rare for me. I really love their esparagus and chicken noodle soup. They didn't have that much Asian food choices which was kinda disappointing. Decent number of choices pastries and deserts. They didn't have Raspberry Iced Tea!! really weird. 

I guess I had better expectations from this buffet but mostly got disappointed.Great buffet!

3 stars


For the money prefer the WYNN by a landslide, I have been spoiled there.

The omelet was great even had an option for shrimp and crab.

Most of the stuff I got sat out too long and was not tasty. 

The KOBE - Giant portion is given, I was not asked how I wanted it cooked. It was way too rare I couldn't cut it with my knife it was like rubber. The cooked ends that I was able to cut and eat were very good. I can't imagine how much they waste.

Many good plates I'll have to come back.

OH the orange juice was exquisite.OK, I am not a buffet person.  It generally is just too much food for me and I can never justify the price.  However, since we where staying at Planet Hollywood and wanted someplace easy to to eat dinner we thought we would try Spice Market.  Everyone seemed to rave about it, so I figured we would give it a go.  

You take the escalator down to the buffet and you are faced with a huge array of stations from Seafood to Salad.  At $30/per person for dinner, it is a pricey buffet no matter how you cut it. There was a lot of variety and I got selections from the Asian, American, Mexican and Italian stations.  Not to mention the delicious dessert selections.  The big draws seem to be the seafood station and desert bar.  

The place was packed and full of people half in the bag, stuffing their faces and yelling.  Maybe that was part of the reason it didn't wow me.  It was a just a buffet, with decent food, good selection and nothing that stood out.  

I think this is my last Vegas buffet.  It just isn't my thing!Im in good 'ol Madison visiting family and was taken to the old fashioned. Of course I had to try the signature drink - the old fashioned which is a brandy based cocktail with some orange slices and a maraschino cherry. It's sweet and really allows the flavor of the brandy to come through. I currently have have an appetite that makes all-you-can-eat buffet owners cringe and at TOF I got soup, (1/2) salad and a sandwich w/ salad on the side. My pulled pork sandwich was tasty with the sweet relish inside. It wasn't dripping with overpowering bbq sauce - a big plus. Itjust wasn't enough to fill me up and i'm glad I got the other two dishes.

Overall I'd say the old fashioned is a big notch above pub grub but the menu which is heavy on the sandwiches and light on full plates of food leaves something to be desired.Still in Vegas but had to post a review because really had an unimpressive dinner the other night.  Reservations were made and we were seated promptly.  Service was great and is why I'm giving 3 instead of two stars.  Great wine list although we just got a few wines by the glass.  They were nice enough to give us a taste of each to make sure we liked them.  Started with the sea scallop appetizer which was really good.  My wife got the seafood risotto and I tried it....it reinforced my opinion that if you want good risotto, you should stay home and make it yourself because rarely is restaurant risotto any good....it just takes too much time to make the right way, and restaurants don't have the time so they usually cook it part way then finish it.  I couldn't decide between two pasta entrees so I ordered them both...a seafood lasagnette dish and the spaghetti with lobster.  Both had good flavor but the spaghetti wasn't cooked enough and just didn't taste good....and later I learned it wasn't homemade.  The taste of the sauce and lobster was good but the pasta just ruined it....For $38, and at the freakin' Wynn, why would you serve anything but homemade pasta....it was really disappointing.  The other pasta dish was the seafood lasagnette which was made with fresh pasta and you could absolutely tell the difference.  Pasta was delicious.  The seafood that was mixed in was just okay, and the sauce had good flavor, but overall I wasn't pleased with my meal and left disappointed.  I have been more satisfied with my meal at italian chain restaurants.  With 3 glasses of wine, the bill was about 200 bucks.  

They specialize in Mediterranean seafood but my wife and I couldn't agree on a fish, and you typically split a whole fish, which is why we went with our pasta dishes....the fish might be spectacular but they should put an equal amount of energy into their pasta dishes, or take them off the menu.  And please, for Pete's sake, fresh pasta only!

In summary, great service, but the food just doesn't make coming here worth it.  I won't be back.This is a cool place to hang out. You can see all of Las Vegas, and the area is pretty big. The only thing I did not like was the DJ. Played crappy music for a long time, and i was mad I had to pay $20.The food was very good but expensive so with a Groupon it was reasonable but probably not worth the top $ with the more casual atmosphere. I don't like the open air/casino restaurants and the carafe of wine with the groupon was 2 glasses, they should just state that. We had very good service and both the Cioppino and my husbands Turbo were excellent. I had a watercress salad that was fresh and delicious but hardly worth $15 and my husband had very good clam chowder.  It wasn't very busy and with the Groupon out, I'm thinking RM is possibly on it's way out the door at some point so if you want to try it, I suggest getting over there sooner vs. later....Service was good, but quality of the fish was a bit off, except the King Salmon was right. Cucumber salad was over pickled.Went here for my mom's 50th b-day. We were joined by a total of 15 other people who are family. Let's just say that there were many complaints on the amount of food given for the price we paid. Not a great place for a large crowd but very doable for a couple's date. Also, the service was not great being that it is a 5 star restaurant. I guess you could say that I simply expected more for the price we paid. I honestly could have gotten a better steak @ Outback for 1/2 the price and larger quantity. 

I'm giving it 3 stars for it's great decor and ambiance (TAO-like w/ Asian inspired decor & dim lighting).

A FANTASTIC VIEW OF THE STRIP!!!This is where we went after being turned away at Border Grill, so it is at least open till 10 pm.

Beef short ribs, I haven't had a decent plate since Claim Jumper back in CA stopped offering these bad boys.  They were served a little weird in that the sauce they were dressed in made them resemble brownies.  They were decent, but I didn't have the same dizziness I had from the Claim Jumper ones due to the crazy calorie rush. I also had grapefruit juice, cappuccino, and green salad.  Not bad, not great.  I did end up footing over $50 for the privilege, not exactly a great deal.It was "ok" there wasn't much of a selection and it was a little high priced! i might try this again. The server was very nice but wasn't very attentive.Had a very good breakfast at this place! Show and presentation are definitely in line here. Service was efficient, but not quick. It was busy, but not overly so to where we couldn't have been handled better. Enjoyed it overall however.Ate breakfast here on our way out of town. Chose it out of convenience at we were staying at THE Hotel. Was told wait was 15 minutes or immediate seating at the "high bar tables only". We opted for the bar, but at least half the restaurant was empty and the regular tables in the same section were completely empty (the high tables are very uncomfortable for me to sit at because of back problems and also for the husband who is very tall).

The server was very prompt and friendly and brought coffee right away. However, we did wait about 25 minutes for our food.

The food was tasty, but my omelet had a wrong ingredient in it and I was brought toast with no jelly or butter. My husband said the corned beef hash was better at Red, White and Blue (also in MB hotel), and his poached eggs were not really poached at all (not runny but solid).

We were on a time crunch so we didn't have my order corrected and I borrowed jelly from the table next to me.

For Vegas, the prices are pretty reasonable. I will probably try another place next time.This restaurant has a bit of an identity crisis. It is in the Chinese cultural center, but serves Japanese beer (Kirin on tap!) and the live piano music is American pop. We had to ask for chopsticks.

Having said that, the service was professional. Our waiter held a hot appetizer for one of our party who was away from the table so that it would not be cold when he returned. We were asked frequently--and not too frequently--if things were ok both by our waiter and the manager/proprietor.

The food was ok-to-good. Fried shrimp egg rolls were dainty but yummy. Duck was tasty but very chewy. Kung-pao chicken was pleasantly spiced. Plenty of rice. A pitcher of ice water with lemon was left at the table. 

Atmosphere was also pleasant. Chairs comfortable, tables spaced well, restrooms large and clean...and there is indeed a large golden Buddha by the entrance.It's not as great as xs but me and my girlfriends have great memories here:)The meal comes with complimentary chips and 3 types of salsa.

I ordered the Shrimp Ceviche and was unimpressed.  I've had better shrimp Ceviche in east san jose.

My boyfriend ordered the chicken tacos, which came with black beans and spanish rice.  There was nothing special about the whole plate.  They don't even ask you what type of beans you want.

The service was better than the food, and out of all the food we tried, the chips and salsa were the best.Meh....as expected for a chain restaurant in Vegas.  Everything was average....food emphasized quantity over quality, cocktails were ok, and service was average.  I found the crowd annoying....it's kind of a place where people stumble in off the street so you get a lot of that vibe in the restaurant.So I am in the the Middleton, WI area for work.  I am basically in the middle of nowhere.  I find a gem in Abuelo.  

Service: Good
Margarita's: FAB
Allows me to order a la carte: Check

Very enjoyable.  I will definitely return since I will be in the area for a few weeks.We had a great meal here - everyone was happy. I enjoyed the lump crab cake and the eggplant parmesan with burrata cheese. One of my favorite things at the table was the mushroom pizzetta - fabulous. The pork entree was also very good. If you're staying at the Wynn and looking for something that's not obscenely obscenely expensive, recommended.This is a very nice place to just relax. The drinks are not priced like the ambiance, just normal Vegas standard. The food was impeccable as to be expected, but way too overpriced for the size...again which was to be expected. I think I liked it because the lighting and everything just felt so calm. I do not know if this was for sheer laziness or consideration, but I liked how the waiters did not come over every 10 minutes to ask how things are doing. One freaky moment though, some dude and his wife kept staring at me. It was a blatant stare, not even a glance, for a good 5 sets of 2 minute each, and considering they were seated right next to me, made it awwwwkwaarrrrrd. I started getting annoyed so I though crap, might as well stare back, but their perv power put me in my place right away.A nice steakhouse with a high class atmosphere, this is as good a place as any in Las Vegas to blow 50+ dollars on a slab of meat.  As with everything in Vegas, excess is best at the Country Club as well.  

This was one of my first fine dinning experiences at the Wynn Hotel and Resort and although I'm not a Vegas person, I thought this place had good food.   

I had the pork chop and my friends had the rib eye.  All were good and well prepared (medium - except the pork) and were satisfying in size.

I hear the view of the golf course outside during the day is truly something for fans of the game to enjoy over a cocktail and some breakfast, lunch or early dinner.Like several others have said, Ra is the Sushi Bar for people who don't love(or even like) Sushi.
I had their Spicy Yellowtail roll which was indeed very good, but compared to many other Sushi places a bit expensive. 
The atmosphere is overly trendy with music so loud you can barely even have a conversation. I also found the photo lab lighting to be kind of creepy. Why in the world would you use that type of lighting for a restaurant? 
Also, although I did like what I had, there are many neighborhood/off-the-radar sushi places which are of far better quality. The Sushi at Ra is really nothing special. The happy hour deal is pretty good though, so look into that if you want to get a little more for your money.Not as good as the Bellagio but I'm very prejudice for the Bellagio as that is still my favorite casino EVER after living in LV for 10 years.

See if you can get a seat poolside but they don't tend to open that up unless they really need the seating.Um at the I-Bar, there are women "dressed" in lingerie dancing on top of these elevated platforms to resurrected '90s music. Great. Drop it like its hot in your thigh hi's right above my cocktail. Gee. Thanks. 

The cocktail was delicious though. I had "Delightful kiss!" and Mara G. braved the bartender's choice. Whoa! Ok. Easy baby.

I would return to the I-Bar again. Hope they have some male dancers in lingerie next time. I guess you have to pay to get into the Chippendale's show for that...Maggiano's Little Italy is on the second floor of the Fashion Show Mall, across from the Wynn and Treasure Island on Las Vegas Blvd. 

Maggiano's is a chain restaurant that can be found in over 20 states. I have eaten at the one in Minneapolis as well as this one. I guess in the hiearchy of Italian food Chain restaurants it goes something like this:

Out of the can and not Italian: Chef Boyardee
Slightly better Casual not Italian: Olive Garden and Macaroni Grill
A little better if you didn't know better: Pasta Pomodoro 
Mid-level trying to fool you as high-end Italian: Maggiano's and Buca de Beppo
Higher prices and more Northern Italian: Il Forniao
Really great Italian: don't tend to be chain restaurants 

Maggiano's has nice ambiance, expensive dark wood decor, and is usually very popular and crowded. In Vegas expect to wait even with a reservation. We had a party of 10, called at 5 and couldn't get reservation until 8:30. Maggiano's is perfect for large parties, as they offer huge dishes that are meant to be shared (most have a half size option, so take it!) They offer a family style approach special menu for large groups, where the cost is $29.95 per person, and includes 2 shared appetizers, 2 pastas, and 2 mains in a bottomless approach. They encourage this, as they will tell you if you order a la carte, it may take 30 - 45 minutes (for Pasta?). we went a la carte because some didn;t want to comprimise into limited selections. 

The Mozzarella Buffula appetizer (what they called Tomato Slice and Mozzarella, or something like that) is one of my favorite Italian appetizers. The special goat mozzarella with a basil leaf over a tomato slice is a nice combination, Maggiano's shreds the basil, which I prefer the fresh whole leaf. You get 3 slices with an order. 

The Capellini d'arrabiata (which they call by the English name of Angel Hair) comes in a huge bowl with about 1/2 to 1 pound of pasta, roma tomatoes, garlic and a little oil, with some basil, and a slightly spicey arrabiata sauce. They have a couple of lasagna offerings, either covered in a bolognese (ground beef) sauce or in a Marinara. It is huge, like everything is. There is a large menu of good selections for most people. 

They don't offer olive oil and balsamic vinegar with your bread, but if you ask for it, they will bring it to you. 

If you want A LOT of food and willing to pay over $30 per person for Pasta, go here.I came here because it's 50% off for locals so I got in for about $34.50 for two. First thing I got to say is that it went downhill from the first time I came here back in the day. I eat a crap ton, so even if I did pay for 30 bucks I'd usually eat my money's worth. 

So I got here and the the line was quite long. Surprisingly the line went by pretty quickly; got in within 30 minutes. Got seated pretty quick and our waiter got our waters to our table pretty quick too.

For the food, prime rib wasn't bad ! The brown gravy tasted funky for the mashed potatoes. The salmon was way overcooked. I didn't care for it being frozen because its a $17 dollar buffet, can't be toooo picky. Some stuff just couldn't be edible because it was kinda disgustingly bland or ew. I ate like 7 plates, not counting dessert, and food quality id say is a 2.5-3 stars. Back then it was like, delish and better made :(. The best part are the gelatos though. I'm a sucker for sweets. 

Locals make sure you get the players card in order to get your discounts !Biggest complaint first.  No chips and Salsa.  Ok.  So I agree to pay $9.00 for guacamole.  "Made in Molcajete" ... maybe so - don't know because it's not served that way.  I DO know that when the bowl came out, there was some liquid forming around the bottom of the scoop of flavorless guacamole - perhaps from the thawing from the costco bag?  I don't know - but I do know - the replacement scoop didn't have the liquid at first, but as time progressed - it collected.  Yuk.  It wasn't flavorful at all.  If you pay $9 for Guacamole... It best be FRESH FRESH FRESH.  FLAVORFUL!  PLEASE.  The three "salsas" on the side were SMALL little ramekins - so small a chip can't dip into it .. you have to break the chip up and just dip - not scoop - the salsa (one of which is Pico de Gallo)  They were ok, but nothing to write home about.  Sorry - but I expect a lot more from these two items at this kind of restaurant.  It's not hard to wow me with salsa and guacamole.  FAIL.

The rest of the meal was pretty good for all three of us, but this just left a bad taste in my mouth.  Bummer.Tapino looks like a chain restaurant, but fools you with the decent food...I went last night with my wife and family for dinner and had a really good time.  Tapas lends itself to sharing and trying things that you wouldn't normally order.  
I had the lobster corn dogs ( yes, they were great ) and the braised short ribs ( even better than you think ).  My wife had the artichokes and mussels, which were both well done.  In a myriad laps, the plates that came by included escargot ( great ! ), pork kabobs ( awesome ), foie gras ( good ), pommes frittes ( a bit soggy, but good ), and 
risotto ( undercooked ).  The creme brulee was marvelous...
Everything was decently priced and the service was fair...
I would go back again and grab a bite at the bar and do a happy hour thing.  Like I said earlier, looks like a chain version of a much smaller place..Good food, fair prices, but could stand to maybe be in a space half its size...ok, le reve was... well, OKay.  the water was cool and we had awesome seats.  (if you decide to go, book on the aisle between section E & F.)  but, again, it didn't knock anything off my top three cirque lists... which (granted) is a hard thing to do.  however, it was like it was advertised... the best of the best.  yet, very similar to my reaction of going to the wynn for the first time, i felt like saying... blah.  there are too many pretty things going on at the same time in the casion decor that it just fell into a pithole of spoil and... well, blah (yuck!).  lastly, what's up with the nudity.  unlike zumanity, it was unnecessary and lacked artistic taste.Chose this place seeing as it was listed in the Top 10 Vegas Buffets. More specifically, I came here given the promise of variety, and sushi rolls. No sushi rolls, much to my chagrin, and yes, the variety was there, but quality...not quite. Just when I thought quality and quantity could coexist... My main reason for the low rating was for their overpricing. $25 for a $15 buffet, at best, ehh. After waiting in the unnecessarily long line to get in, we proceeded to indulge in prime rib, which was a notch below rare(I gave it another chance however, to which it improved greatly), rock hard "soft" corn tortillas(the Mexican station would've been great though without this mishap), mediocre seafood(lobster was decent), and crap clam chowder(no positive statement in parentheses to help this one out). If anything can cheer you up from not getting your money's worth, head over to the dessert station. A huge variety of desserts including diabetes-on-a-stick, I mean, cotton candy and an amazing ice cream. No not your usual soft serve on a dinky cone ice cream, hand scooped from the tub onto a mysteriously, amazing waffle cone ice cream. Perhaps my beef with their quality(it is a buffet after all) attributes from the overpricing, so if you can look past that, feel free to come to this ordinary, but abundant buffet. 

P.S. - The smell of cigarettes may linger through, however. 
P.S. - No comment on the service, considering it is Las Vegas. But luckily, we got a server who was extremely nice.This place is so cute. I love the location and the decor. Too bad the service was kind of weird and the food was iffy. Not bad. Just iffy.

The first thing everyone mentions about Lisa G is thier meatballs. The meatballs are okay but not all that. I tried them after hearing everyone rant and rave and was a bit dissapointed. They weren't bad - just not the amazing experience I've heard about. My sandwhich was not that great either. I will say that my dining partners really enjoyed thier food and were quite happy with thier experience. 

In summary - I don't love the place but most other people do. To each his own.Definitely not the most fantastic buffet I have been to in Vegas, but it did the trick on a Sunday afternoon with some buddies and a Groupon. $45 for 2 to eat with all you can drink adult beverages. That was a great thing.. but the buffet itself left alot to be desired. 

The layout of the space is so clumsy and awkward that you are shoved into back corners of the place.. we actually had a table IN THE WALKWAY of the back room we were seated in. It's not so comfortable. On top of it all, there was no selection of 'Asian-Style' food.. no sweet and sour, no tempura anything.. and really not alot of selection overall. 

The main thing that saved this dining experience is that they have a crepe counter. Both savory and sweet crepes.. they are a great addition to the pretty weak selection. I say give it a try for that reason, and if you can get a deal. Happy Eating!Not too bad. Buffet is huge, but cuisine is nothing too elaborate. Prime rib, pizza, mexican...as any buffet on a Friday night would be, it was jam packed.Thank you for feeding my inebriated self some delicious sliders and fries at 4:30am. I actually am not sure if they were delicious or not but my friend said I dove for the last fry on the plate when she was trying to get me to head back to the hotel. I believe that and the fact that I ate 2 of the 3 sliders we orderd is an indicator that the food was good. Thank you for letting me think that by my friend and I wearing our sunglasses inside at that time that no one would notice how drunk we were. Finally thank you for letting me nap for a minute or two in the booth while we awaited the arrival of our food.3.5 Stars.

So its been a couple of weeks since we've come back from Vegas, and the experience resonated with us in both a negative and positive way.  It was a nice dinner but I can't help but still be miffed about one thing - the BRUSQUE hostess!  The young asian girl that manned the front barely made eye contact with us, was so cold, never smiled, and was really good at making you feel unimportant.  We checked in with her for our reservations, and stepped aside about 2 feet away from her to wait as she asked.  A short moment later she was cued that our table was ready she calls out our last name towards the other waiting parties.  I mean really - we're no Brangelina, but didn't she just talk to us a second ago?  With a meager acknowledgement she brisked us away towards our table as we hurriedly followed behind her, barely being able to keep up with her pace.  She just dumped us at our table and she walked away mumbling "Enjoy your meal."  I don't care if she's having a bad night - that's just unexcusable and she should not be doing this job!  Anyway, let's get to the food, which thank gawd, was much better than the welcome wagon.

The Onion Soup Shooter Veloute quickly caught my attention on the menu. 
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g?select=C-pDKxqs7P9_XfL8FJLI7Q
Oh my, this was lovely to the senses as soon as it arrived to our table.  You pour the white creamy soup into these slender sipping glasses that help the wonderful mixed aroma of onion and truffle waft into your nose as you sip.  It was so good that I was worried that there might not be enough, but the huzbeau and I were able to have at least three shots each.

The tender Braised Hamachi rested on top of some very flavorful pickled shiitake mushrooms and the blanket of soy ginger foam on it rounded out each bite perfectly.  It was so light and delicate and I liked it almost as much as the soup. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g?select=PcLlxY661ppzFROMrjho2w

We weren't too hungry, so we decided to share a Pepper Crusted Filet Mignon with a side of Fingerling Potato Puree. We ordered the meat medium rare and although it tasted fine, there were parts of the filet that were chewy.  The potatoes were just ok too.  Both were presented very nicely but they just weren't that notable as I'd hope they'd be. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g?select=V7Ec-Y_rYuYJB_ECfzeVuw

Most reviewers seem to like the Sangria and I'm assuming that they had the red.  We ordered the white, and regrettably it really wasn't that great. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g?select=nFbp8SFThRlQrDp7j2xkAw

At the front of the establishment, the brightly lit patio seating that surrounds the bar doesn't require reservations and is quite misleading as to how the restaurant really looks inside.   The dark interior had a very warm feel with its textured stone walls. The sculptural chandeliers and strategically placed recessed lighting played up the high ceilings very well.  Large parties are seated in well placed coves where they can have good conversation without disrupting those on a romantic date.

It was such a relief that our servers were not cut from the same cloth as the hostess and they were great.  I'd highly recommend a visit here just for the Truffled Onion Soup - but would hope that a friendlier and more professional hostess is working when you go!This place probably gave me the best experience I had while staying at the Mandalay Bay.  That's not saying much.  I only say this because it was the only honestly priced restaurant in the casino/hotel.  

Decent food at a decent price.  I got an Omelet, some fruit, hash browns and spent  roughly $25. Not bad!Convenient if you're hungry inside the Mandalay Bay, but expect mediocrity at best.   

One dish I would definitely recommend if you are fiending for breakfast is the the corned beef hash.    Mixed with the potato hash browns and molded into a dome mound with superfluous portions of lean beef.   DelectableThis is now the fifth time I have had a meal here.  Two previous dinners and two previous lunches.  I went last night with my daughter who had never been to a Brazilian Churrascaria before, so I wanted to give her the experience of dining at such a place.

I think my rating reflects the fact that I found a slight deteriorating in the food quality this time.  While I must say that all previous times that I have dined here have all not been outstanding regarding food quality, I think this time there was a slight deterioration.  The appetizer/salad/side order bar still had a lot of things on it, but the food items were of lesser quality -- for instance, the shrimps were smaller (like baby shrimps) and previously frozen; not fresh.  The stuffed deviled eggs tasted a little old.  The marinated mushrooms were small and also tasted a little old.  The salads were OK.

They still had a good variety and selection of meats, but my guess is that since the economy still sucks, their business is down and the volume of customers does not justify them using the better grades of meat.  Further, this same negative economical effect also causes them to grill smaller portions of meat to reduce waste -- this then causes the meats to be less juicy and it is impossible to get a nice cut of rare or even medium-rare meat.  Everything last night was medium to well done, which is simply not to my liking.  However, since my daughter likes her meats medium well, she enjoyed everything.  Oh yeah, I also found the lamb to be overdone and the sausages to be tasteless.

Now, having read my review here, you probably would think that my opinion about this restaurant really is down, but I will say that that is not true.  I simply was a little disappointed but would still say that this place is still worth fraternizing.  Their price is higher than other restaurants, but considerably lower than other churrascaria's.  And oh yeah, they are running a promotion for Mondays -- buy two dinners and get a whole bottle of wine for free.  So I got a a whole bottle of cab for free and I must tell you that it was decent cab -- not great but not two buck chuck either.  It was one of their cabs off of their standard wine list so that was a pretty good deal to get a whole free bottle of wine with two dinners.I am with Jamie C. on this one.  I think maybe I will have to come back to make my final decision.  Our server was great!  I wish i would have got his name so I could mention him by name... very attentive!  I enjoyed the 2 glasses of sangria I had, but Michael was not that enthused about his mojito.  He switched to Stella for his second:).  For our entrees we shared the calamari and their special which was a blue corn chicken enchilada.  The calamari was very tasty!  I really liked the sauces that came with them and we ate it all!  The enchiladas were very tasty too.  There were many shared plates that I wanted to try so I will definitely come back!I'm a fan of the caramel macchiato, both hot and cold. 

When I worked in Culver City, the closest Starbucks was hit or miss when mixing this drink.  I often got one on the bitter side.

Served by smiling, friendly baristas in the Phoenix airport, I was happy to receive a delicious grande cm.Dave's has a good BBQ sauce and reminds me very much of KC style BBQ and side's.  I have eaten here a few times and found that the portion sizes are immense!  

Service has always been efficient and no reason to complain about anything.  I think this BBQ place would be the best option for a large group.

Is this the best BBQ in the world?  No, but I sure wouldn't turn it down!

Enjoy!We used to go here a lot...until they took the smoked ham off their menu!!! The waitress told us that not many people liked it, but every time I was there, people were eating it. The smoked ham was our family's favorite, so we haven't been back since- bring back the ham!!!It's hard to find quality vegetarian restaurants in the Valley (let alone all-vegetarian eateries at all.) So thank gosh for Udupi Café, a tasty Tempe spot that just so happens to be less than a mile away from the all-vegan Green.

Udupi serves a wide variety of Indian food that, unless you're familiar with the type of cuisine, will require some translation help when ordering.

Be warned: the portions here are huge, which rocks, considering the dirt cheap prices.

I got the Sambar Vada, which are fried lentil donuts you can dip in a spicy sauce. I also got Paneer Pakora, fried cheese, and Poori, big, fluffy bread.

Go here for the food. The ambiance is simple, and the tables aren't exactly the comfiest. The service is also lacking (last night, like many times, I waited more than 10 minutes for a soda refill.)

But Udupi hits the spot for a satisfying, healthy, ethnic meal.My husband would like to give it two stars, I'm closer to two and a half. 

We decided to partake of the all-day buffet price of $30 during the week since we were staying at the MGM. It was a good option for us because we wanted to stay at the pool that day. However, it seems hard to fit three meals into the day unless you get up before 9 AM. The breakfast closes at 11 and lunch closes at 2:30, I think. 

We wanted to have some breakfast since we'd been skipping it all week we were in town. The crepe lines were long and people were fairly pushy. It made you question the whole buffet thing. I mean people, there is enough to go around! 

In general, I would say that the food here is edible if you choose carefully, but there is nothing with perhaps the exception of dessert which is truly good. It's all bland and doing the all-day buffet makes you feel a bit queasy by the end of the day. 

The best bits were the fresh melon, the mini-desserts at the dinner buffet which were tasty and even artistic with white chocolate shavings and other details. They were stingy with the crab and shrimp which was annoying. You have to ask and it is given reluctantly. 

All in all, only go here if it saves you money and you happen to be staying here. We tried to spend about $80 a day on food and this buffet enabled us to stick to it for at least one = )thought this place was going to be very good considering it was at MGM but it wasn't too satisfying. their prime rib was kinda tough and lacked flavor. they did have good braised ribs which was very flavorful. their desserts was pretty good too. i liked the chocolate mousse cup.For the price, it's decent for dinner. $30 on a weekday and about $35 or so on weekends? Have been to this buffet a couple times now....the first experience I think was a touch better, it seems the food has declined over the last few years. 
What I don't like is the layout. Condiments are spread out in various locations and hard to find. Mexican type food seemed to be in two different places. Bowls for soup not near soup? Make your own salad and pre-made salads in two different locations. It was just odd. 
They do have it all though. Some fresh crab and cold seafood options, comfort foods, Mexican, Asian, cuts of meat...it was all pretty OK, fairly average. Fried chicken was a touch dry, mashed potatoes could have used more flavoring. Sushi I would avoid. Lots of tasty items though like the cajun fried fish, prime rib, etc. 
I would recommend for the price, but if you're looking for something AMAZING you are better off at Caesars, Bellagio, or something of the like.Minus one star ....when you make reservations and specify BALCONY.....you better get balcony! Well, after 20min of waiting for our balcony table, and a stern chat with the GM, we had comped drinks and our table.....but really? If I request something.....just give it to me.....or I'll complain until you do.....Nice decor and super nice wait staff but a bit over priced.
Appetizers  and roll dishes were good as expected but we were pleasantly surprised by how good Kobe slider was.The Bellagio cafe was ok.  I've been there before to have the stuffed french toast which I remember as amazing but I've been told even that is hit or miss.  The most recent time we went our service was nice, but the food was just ok.  My husband was not impressed with him regular french toast.  My colleague's oatmeal was nice (but really, you shouldn't be messing up oatmeal), and my omelet was... interesting.  The concept was great - bacon and cheese.  Straight off the menu.  The plate I received was covered in green.  I thought it was chives or green onions for decoration, but I found that they had cooked my omelet with broccoli inside.  Now I love broccoli, but it was not what I was expecting and it was not detailed in the description of my 'bacon and cheese' omelet... and it was packed with broccoli - tons of it!  Not only that, but it added a bland flavor to the omelet.  We were in a hurry so I didn't have time to reorder it, but I was definitely disappointed.  I'll go back for convenience, and next time I'll check exactly what is in my food, but this last trip was a bit disappointing.Upside: 
the seasoned grilled chicken, delectable!
lobster tails
asian food, suprisingly okay tasting
pistachio gelato
garlic butter sauce - that's something i haven't seen before

Downfall:
$50, really?! it's worth maybe more like $30
what did this buffet have that others didn't? i wasn't exactly sureFor my wife and I, this was a two-star experience at best, but you may enjoy it more, IF (capital letters):

1.  You don't mind sitting in a small crowded area on torn stools and quite possibly waiting in line for it (it's open seating and pretty much no reservations).  To be fair, you might find a place in the dining area up the steps, but it only has one very large table and two or three small ones.  The bar area also seats about 20 to 25.  At Sunday brunch it was very crowded.
2.  You aren't really concerned about erratic service so long as it is polite.
3.  You like very spicy food.  I personally like some spice in my food (I order medium heat when given a choice) but this goes way beyond that.  I also like spicy-flavorful, but this was spicy-overwhelm the flavor.
4.  You are not value concious, because prices are a bit steep here.

Obviously I will not be back so why do I think you might enjoy it?  Well, it's different - 

A.  The food gets high marks for creativity and you might enjoy it if you can take the heat.
B.  It's clean -- a hole-in-the-wall but a clean one.  You might enjoy the "quirky" ambiance.I paid this cafe a visit last evening for dinner.  The line wait to get inside was long and moved very slowly, even though once inside I saw many empty tables.  The hostess kept trying to get people to sit at the counter up front, but I wanted a table and just held out.

I ordered the 8 oz prime rib special.  I was not disappointed.  It was a very nice, juicy, tender, and flavorful piece of meat.  In fact, it was much, much better than a $25 prime rib meal offered at one of our restaurants back home.  It comes with choice of potato, a vegetable, salad bar or soup, and cherries jubilee ice cream desert.  All the food was great and exceeded my expectations.

Service was only fair.  Never received a drink refill, or an offer of one.  About three different servers performed various tasks at my table.  Service was inconsistent and confused.  

But I came for the food and was perfectly satisfied with it and enjoyed it.Played this course a few weeks ago while in Vegas for the wknd. Booked over the phone for 2 ladies with cart, balls, and club rental. Received confirmation email with some details but failed to include course address so we had to call and ask for address as we had been told the "Mountain Course" but weren't quite sure what that meant. After 3ish price dropped to 70 bucks so we chose to play at that time as well we were told course would be less busy. Upon arrival they did not have 2 sets of ladies clubs and no one seemed too worried about rectifying the situation until I mentioned I would be yelping the situation. Then a set of brand new TM Speed Blade clubs were found and I got to play with them with the gentleman reminding me to make sure that I yelped that they had done this for us...yeah ok. Course was in pretty good shape. Tons of rock though. Course was packed with singles. Carts were in good shape with coolers and ice provided. Nice GPS feature on the cart but unfortunately it wasn't working. Overall, pretty good value for money considering it was a last minute idea and we didn't pack our clubs. I'm in the market for new ones and being able to test drive those Taylor Made Speed Blades was SWEET! PS: Bringing beer to course is illegal in Las Vegas...we had no idea but were able to purchase from beer lady.I made reservations, so I didn't need to wait for a table, even though the place was busy. The service was perfunctory. The waiter appeared just three times: to take my order, bring the food, and bring the check. 

I had  the Sage Fried Chicken & Bacon Waffle Tower. The chicken was moist with a crunchy coating. The waffles stuffed with bacon was a good idea, but weak on the execution - they were rather dry with no extra syrup on the side. I really liked the unusual  garnishes. Fresh lemonade was perfect - not too sweet.

On a previous visit a year or so ago, I enjoyed the pork tenderloin sandwich. I remember the service being much better at that time.If you go on a weekend this place is packed in the mornings.  You're super hungry by the time you sit down and order.  It takes another 20-30 minutes before you get your food.  By the time your meal arrives, you're so blown away by the big portions that you end up scarfing it all down.  It tastes super good in the moment but if you think in retrospect... its not that great.  The only reason it tasted spectacular is because you waited for so long to get your food that you were really hungry.  

Really, the food was alright...Always been a fan of this place, but I think their breakfast menu items are better than the other meal period menu items. Have had the burgers before, very greasy and bland. Chicken and Waffles were okay. Sage Fried Chicken was good, but inconsistent. Sometimes its very good, and sometimes, not so much. The waffles however are always terrible. Being as how they have bacon inside them, you would think they would be great. We always end up pulling the bacon out and eating that alone.  They have good strong coffee and the Jam Du jour is tasty. My favorite dish is the Sage Fried Chicken Benedict, but sometimes the potatoes come out cold. They have great plate presentations, but even that cannot cover up some of the small protein portions on the dinners, like the MIxed Grill special they often have. Much of this place is hype, so just stick with the breakfast there and you'll be fine.Hash House is great. They serve large servings of farm inspired meals. We like taking out of town guests here b/c they always get a kick out of the industrial atmosphere and interesting menu choices. We used to eat here more before we evolved our diets to be more plant-based. There are only a few vegetarian options here and no vegan options (last we were there, which was probably over 2 years now). But... we would still recommend it. We've always been happy w/ the food. The service is just ok. We prefer more guinuine personalities and one waiter in particular seems like he's putting on a play. But sometimes you put up w/ that for some good food... sometimes you don't. Depends on the day.The service is slow, they take their time and there is no urgency in their service. The food is great though!TC's specializes in down home cooking and Southern hospitality, and it definitely feels that way when you walk in.  The restaurant is comfortably decorated; I like the red tone to it.  And the menu is a simple size while still offering sufficient options.

The date and I each got our own 2 meat combo with 2 sides and cornbread.  I ordered the baby back ribs, beef brisket, mac and cheese, and Big Sam's baked beans.  Unfortunately, our meals came out sans cornbread, but we asked for it mid-meal and a piping hot paper tray of two pieces of cornbread (they were really muffins) came out.  No butter, not that I needed the calories, but it would've been a nice addition.  And they were just okay.

The baby back rib meat peeled off the bone easily with my fork.  The first bite made me nervous - it was dry.  I kept digging and the meat in the middle was moist.  I don't know what happened, but the moist rib meat was good.  The ribs tasted more steamed than BBQ'd though.  I was really craving a smokier flavor.

The beef brisket was good; it was tender and juicy.  It paired very well with their homemade BBQ sauce.

The mac and cheese and beans came out in styrofoam containers.  That made me nervous thinking that they store their premade sides in the containers and warm them up to order.  But, it did come in handy for taking the sides home since there were plenty of leftovers.  The cheese on the mac and cheese was clumpy and not melted into the normal smooth sauce I was expecting.  It was an odd consistency, but it tasted okay.  The beans were also okay.  Both benefited from a healthy shake of salt and pepper.

My favorite meat was actually the pork links that my date ordered.   They were perfectly salty and had a wonderful smokey char.  They were also beautifully grilled with lovely black grill marks.  I could've eaten just those and been happy all day.

In conclusion, it was okay, but unfortunately not the best BBQ in the valley.  Aside from the smokey flavor missing in some meats, we were also wondering where the BBQ smell was.  The restaurant and parking lot were both missing the potent and mouthwatering fragrance commonly associated with BBQ places.  This left us both to wondering where and how the meats were being prepared.Our group of 6 came here after having dinner on the strip for some beers and munchies.  The sampler of 5 7oz beers for 6.99 can't be beat.  If you like all the beers, you could just drink that all night.  We had the pot stickers, Korean short ribs, edamame, and a few other things I don't remember (ie drunk).  I had meant to try the sushi but didn't.  The short ribs were pretty good.  It was about a 25$ cab ride from Harrah's to here.  Well worth the trip.  Good beer, decent food.  No complaints from anyone in our group.Actually stayed at a local casino as I had some friends in town from the bay area and so we all stayed at the MGM Signature Hotel.

1.  Parking -  5 star - If you are local, they all have their own valet and parking. I did not find self parking, however, the valet was fine. Sometime it took a little bit of time to get the car, yet much faster than casino valet.  The valet jockeys were all nice. 

2,  Bell Desk - 5 star - When you arrive, they assist you with your luggage. I noticed they were very busy yet the team was always there when you needed them.  We had rolling luggage, so we did not need them in the end, yet they were very helpful and attentive. 

3.  Check In - 1 star - We checked in at about 3:30 pm on Friday.  Fridays on a summer month are still busy in Vegas.  My question is, why would they have a staff of two checking everyone in, allow a line of 10 to be created when they have check in computers for at least 6-7 staff?  Did not make sense.  One person in front of us had to be given water by the security as he looked like he was gonna pass out... This is Vegas.  It is Friday.  The impression of the hotel with only 12 people in line watching 2 people handle check in inefficiently is not a positive customer service event.

4.  Suites - 5 star - Absolutely fantastic.  Clean, luxurious, big, sophisticated.  This is not the Four Seasons, or Venetian or Bellagio, however, it is awesome in its own right.  Perhaps a simpler sophistication.

5.  Amenities - 3 star- Small Gift show for food and stuff. - Convenient  Starbucks - Not sure why they don't have more staff from 7 - 9:00 am when 30 people are in line. All of the towers in the MGM Grand go to the same starbucks, or attempt to.  So, line management for a resort should be considered. Not much else.

6.  Walk to facilities - 2 star - To get to the MGM Grand with all things a casino has to offer, dining, gambling, entertainment, you have to walk about 8 minutes.  While it is actually a decently quick walk inside tunnels and all, it is simply not good.  Late at night, it is limited as cleaning crews are cleaning. revelers are being boisterous and if your lady friends are in heels, well, that will not be fun at all.  Very convenient and inconvenient!

I like this place and can recommend it. I would just warn many people the it is a great deal, just that it is not as convenient and properly managed like you would expect.I was next door at Ace Hardware and cold not resist the urge for baba ganoush and tabouli, so I stopped in to get some to bring back home.  These two items are usually my barometers for a Mediterranean joint. The owners are wonderful and very friendly - and so I really wanted to like to food better. The baba ganoush was good, but not great, and the tabouli was just edible.  The diet coke was flat.

I hope I have a chance to come back, because I really want to like this place more.  Next time I'll sit and stay, and order a real meal.3.5 stars. Not bad for a casual, order at the counter, grab your food to eat at tables kind of place. The prices are slightly less than what's around it and honestly the 3 rolls for $1.50 (tomato ones) were really good.

I had a salad which I thought was decent and my wife got soup. Unfortunately she found 2 hairs in her croutons and complained. When she did, they offered her anything on the menu, but since she was grossed out, she got a chocolate croissant which was good. 

I think it's better to order something that's already made here since it takes a little time for the workers to make your sandwich, salad, etc. If I was starving and didn't want to wait for waiter service, I'd stop by again.After we went roaming around Fremont Street in down town Vegas, we decided to get some oysters. The Oyster bar is really small and so we had to wait in line to be seated. I thought the people at the bar were taking their precious time to eat but the service was slow. After like 20-25 minutes we finally got seated. 

We ordered a dozen oysters which took 20 minutes to get served to us bc the the waiter didn't know how to shuck oysters and he was actually complaining in front of us. Another guy took over bc the other dude was acting fussy and this guy was no better. He acted like opening oysters was the worst job on earth. HELLO you work at a Oyster Bar so get your act together or get some more training on Oyster shucking. Everything on the menu looked really good but with their slow service I don't know if the wait is worth it. Most of the dishes were priced $17-$24 dollars if I could remember. Clam chowders are pretty good here and they cost cheaper on the menu.Mike and I came here for dinner and I couldn't shake this feeling of déjà vu. For some reason I was convinced that we had eaten here before, when it was our first time at the Mirage. I was confusing Cravings at the Mirage with the Flavors buffet at Harrahs for some reason. I was very impressed that it was a decent dinner buffet for a decent price. The dessert section let me down a little, but overall I enjoyed Cravings.I ate here with my 3 friends. We put down an insane amount of crab legs, corn muffins, prime rib, sushi, chinese food, pizza, carrot cake and ice cream.

Immediately afterward, we all went to the bathroom next to the buffet, took a seat in 4 adjacent stalls, and we all had massive Mirage Buffet babies together while making fart noises with our arms. 

The food was fine. No great shakes, standard buffet fare, followed by the standard buffet run to drop a major deuce.I think 3.5 stars is about right.

We came here last Saturday night after narrowing it down to Rio and Mandalay Bay.  Mandalay Bay won out this time because we ate at Rio the last time we were in Vegas.  It's always good to try something new, right?

For about $30, you're treated to a better-than-average Vegas buffet.  I think for about $35, you can eat all day long. I'm not really sure if that requires you sitting in the restaurant all day and eating, or whether it means you can leave and come back to eat whenever you want.  Either way, it sounds awesome; I mean, I think the prospect of having a buffet be your day-long prison is a pretty sweet and ridiculous idea.

Anyway, here are some highlights:
+ Lots of seafood!  Crab legs! Many salmony salmons! White fishies! Scallops!  Big shrimp!  Yay scavengers of the sea!
+ Meats!  Chicken legs! Fried! Veal! Stewed! Prime rib! Other many meats for to eat!  Even though I've been trying to eat less red meat, I was like oh screw it, I'm eating well tonight!
+ The Asian foods:  not spectacular, but I still appreciate it being there.  Sushi, pot stickers, Chinese foods, etc.  All decent-tasting!
+ Desserts!  Many! All good!  That's saying a lot!  Because I don't have a sweet tooth!
+ And one of my FAVORITE parts of the meal: they had CHEESES!  I am a lover of the CHEESES, so when I saw the CHEESES I got all drooly and excited and piled all the CHEESES (they's got blue CHEESES, other hard CHEESES that I can't remember, etc.) on my plate, and that was my dessert.  Loved the addition and the tastes of the CHEESES.

I must also note that the dining rooms are very pretty, with dim lighting and a comfortable atmosphere.  

So, overall, I enjoyed this buffet a lot, wasn't blown away, but would consider coming back the next time I'm in Vegas.

Although, if you're deciding on ONE buffet to eat in Vegas, you gotta hit up the Rio buffet.  It is KICK ASS.  

Aite, and with that, I'm out.Nice casual place to wind down or have dinner. They are not open late which is a bummer. I had their riblets which was drenched in sweet bbq sauce. The slaw is tasty but too wet. Fries were evenly cooked. The corn bread that came with the dinner wasn't that good. Miss a bit of corn flavor in it. Nice people to people watch.STEAK...it should be their specialty, right?

Saturday night at 9 pm, STEAK's bar was filling up as the Floyd Mayweather v. Ricky Hatton fight was being shown on their TVs.  I guess this may also explain our initial service when we arrived.

We chose a table close to the bar so we can still see the screens while enjoying our dinner.  (There weren't any seats available at the bar.)  We actually had to ask for our menus since we were forgotten so quickly.

Water and bread were soon to arrive and I was pleasantly surprised with the two hummuses offered alongside the olive oil and balsamic vinegar concoction.  We had to wave someone down so we could get our orders in and I guess everyone was too busy watching the fight.  

We decided to go straight for the beef since a place like STEAK should offer some really good stuff, right?  I went for the Petite Filet Mignon (8 oz.) with Provencal sauce ($27).  It comes with two sides - I chose the scalloped potatoes and saute mushrooms.  When my meat arrived, I can definitely say it was very rare, just like I requested.  The meat lacked flavor and the sauce was just okay.  The saute mushrooms were REALLY good though and thank goodness I got that to add to my  beef.  The scalloped potatoes were quite impressive - about six layers of potato slices and six layers of cheese came out in a hearty serving.  I found this to be quite generous.  The potatoes were just okay in my opinion, but the BF ate it all up!

The BF went straight for the Boneless Rib Eye with Bearnaise sauce and Cabernet Reduction sauce ($27).  (The waiter was nice enough to give him two sauces.)  He chose the mac & cheese and STEAK fries for his two sides.  The meat was more medium than medium rare unfortunately, so it was too much for me to chew.  He did find his steak to be medium rare in a different part of the beef though.  The mac and cheese was rather grainy, not how I particularly like it.  (I like mine smooth and creamy.)  We both liked the STEAK fries though - they reminded me of when my dad would have potato slices and pan fry them instead of deep frying them. (It made us want to go home and make them ourselves!)  The cabernet reduction was okay, but it was the bearnaise sauce that had me going.  It was so buttery and fatty, and oh so good!  Dipping the STEAK fries into that sauce was oh so good!     

We were both very full after our dinner and the additional serving of bread I had requested.  I did peruse the dessert menu and saw things like Cotton Candy, Marinated Berries, and Basque Cake that struck my fancy.  (All desserts were $10, except for the cotton candy which was $8).

Overall, the food was just okay.  They had some really good sides, but their meat entrees were just average.

Service was much better once we got a designated waiter.  The staff were moving furniture around and left the doors open behind us causing a draft.  Our waiter made a point of closing the doors as other employees would continuously leave it open.  Thank goodness for him! 

They are definitely trying to make this a neighborhood place to hang out with weekly events like: 

Open Bar on Mondays and Thursdays from 5 pm to 7 pm.
Live Music on Saturdays at 10 pm.  (We left before this started.)
Wine Tasting on Saturdays from 3 pm to 5 pm.

We would consider going back and checking out their wine menu more or even grabbing dessert and hanging out by the bar.  I don't think we would return back for the steak though.

(I posted pics of our meal in the business profile.)I really liked this place. I went for happy hour with my friend and had a good time there. I just got nachos and a drink so I do not know much about their food but I heard they have really great sandwiches. It is amongst  many of the cool places on Mill Ave.If you want to hoit your toit, the Ocean Club has you covered, and the seafood here is extraordinary. I lopped one star due to the usually wonderful service being off last night, but the seafood tower with iced crab, oysters on the half shell, and pink, chubby shrimp the size of a child's fist can go far to assuage lax service. The OC has long been the place to watch your local legislators, honchos and botoxed, spray-tanned Scottsdale tennis set letting their hair down next to the piano bar. The clientele here doesn't mind paying $18 for a cosmo with cool dry ice bubbling it up into a witches' brew, but the music before ten was blasting so loud that even intimate conversation was nearly impossible. Why a restaurant of this caliber would shatter ambience with ridiculous amps is beyond me. We ordered a basket of string fries as an appetizer, and our waitress suddenly had bigger fish to fry since we didn't order the tower or another ginormous, spendy menu item like we usually do. When quality of service is gauged to the size of the bill this obviously, staff training needs a jump start. Kitchen staff smoking next to valet isn't appealing, either. The homemade whipped cream with the creme brulee and chocolate suicide cake was simply decadent, but still, the music level and service issues must be overcome if OC wants to stay in the game in this part of town.Monday evening at 5:30p....
The streets are empty....we walk into the bar looking for a Happy Hour beer while we wait for a Yelp event to get started a few doors down.   Noticing a couple of people on the sidewalk we expected more people inside....
*crickets chirping*  [You'd hear them if it wasn't for a few of the TVs that had their volume turned up.]  The interior was welcoming and clean...but why are we the only ones here...

The bartender was rather indifferent and sauntered over like he was wishing he could be somewhere else too.  We had a leisurely beer and tabbed out....I may have to check out this place again if I find myself in the area.Very lovely place.  I was impressed with accommodations.  The actual sales staff left something to be desired.  It was especially unimpressive when my sales person made a couple of "off color" remarks that I felt were racist (I'm sure he would have definitely thought they weren't). I wouldn't buy into this time share.  They seem really shady and operate like used car salesmen.  Honestly, if you don't already have timeshare points with them, don't do it.  Run for the hills.  They lie, lie, lie, lie.The Good: Beautiful rooms! It was like staying in a nicely furnished condo. The kitchen had every appliance and pot and pan you would need. And the rooms were very clean. The entire hotel smelled wonderfully. And the pools were very nice, though small. Also, it wasn't too far from the strip. But I can see that if you are young, unless you get to stay here for free, you may enjoy staying at a hotel on the strip more. There are a lot of families and older couples that stay here, which isn't bad, but maybe not the "scene" for everyone.

The Bad: Unless you are ok with being personally insulted, held hostage for 2+ hours, and made to feel like the biggest dirt bag in the world for not buying a $12,000 timeshare (excuse me, "vacation ownership") on the spot, UNINVITE yourself to the sales pitches and free comps they invite you to when you get a tour of the hotel. Our salesman was nice, but when he saw we weren't going to buy, he brought in a "closer" who insulted me so horribly he made me cry. Embarrassing, but true.Nice lively atmosphere with indoor and outdoor seating. We received good service. The food was acceptable, though not particularly memorable. I'll return to try and find their good dishes.Moon is a big club with a big retractable roof and nice views.  Those two things are about the only things that make Moon any different from other clubs.  The best part about our experience at Moon were the laughable celebrity sightings of the Hilton crew, the Real World crew and the picture with Suge Knight that I will always cherish...West Siiiiiiiide.I saw K-OS, Shad, and Astronautalis here about a week ago, and the show was off the hook.  Chaser's itself?  Not quite as hot as the music they support, but a solid venue in a city that doesn't really have much competition.

Despite being small and Asian, I'm not exactly a wimp.  That said, I was actually scared to go in thanks to its location.  Sure, it's still Scottsdale, but anything in a strip mall with an adjacent Western Union is usually pretty sketchy.  The plus side of this is that the strip mall affords the club a huge parking lot at night.  It's just a shame that it looks so nondescript and seedy from the outside.

Luckily, once you get inside the bar/nightclub is more inviting.  The sound is great in here.  I can definitely see why this would be a great venue from the artists' perspective.  Astronautalis rocked (a HUGE understatement) an entire set backed only by the music on his MacBook.  Music definitely sounds good in here.  The bar's okay.  Not quite as hip as some of the ones in Tucson's club scene, but the drinks aren't bad

Basically, it's just like everyone else has said.  If you're a fan of a band that's playing here, then this place will deliver just fine.  I don't know if I'd go here for any other reason, though.This place is usually awesome but our service tonight was very poor. We could hardly understand our server and she screwed up our order on more than one account. Always ask for Glenn he's the best they've got!Decent cab service with OK prices... for Vegas. The driver was fairly entertaining but couldn't drive worth a damn. It was a short trip to the airport, and he hooked me up with extra receipts to cover up the drinking expenses on the business trip, which is always nice ;)Location, location, location. Mill Avenue's Harkins Centerpoint has one of the best locations in Arizona. The theatre is located on Mill Avenue, a popular college street, which is a hop, skip and a jump away from campus. And I'm a fan because it's pretty close to where I live. 

If you're looking for luxury, try the new Harkins at Tempe Marketplace. But if you enjoy quiet, peaceful theatres, you'll like it here even with the old seats and lack of grub. Even though it's close to campus, the theatre is rarely crowded, which makes it nice when you're running late and don't want to battle the crowds. It's also a nice theatre to go catch a flick by yourself.They do have creative drinks... unfortunately the ones we had were not very tasty...
It was more like an experiment for us.
The bathrooms were "fun" with the one way mirror... 
Anyways, was it a cool place to stop by? Yes.
Would I go back if I had a choice? Maybe not.I don't know, you go there and drink.  There are flying buttresses.  Aren't there cheaper places around?  The cocktails were $6 and the martinis were $10.  I was too drunk to ask for beer.  Really loud, bring some earplugs.  There is a fireplace which is nice.  You can sit around it and there are some nice seats in there. I guess if you are going there this is a place to go that is not "vegas" and it's strange because you walk outside and there are lots of lights and casinos and shit.  Hard to talk to your friend because it's so loud.  There is a back room with more dance DJ stuff going on.  Beware of assholes offering to "get you really fucked up" in the bathroom when you're trying to pee.

I think I like "Vegas" more than trying not to be Vegas though.  If this were trying to not be vegas it should be real cheap, feel me?  There's no video poker though.There is only one reason to go into this dump and that is for the Deep Fried Oreos.

The girls in front are scary, the machines are old and you have to use and recieve coins which are filthy and gross.

Make your way all the way to the back (trying not to touch anything on the way) and just past the bar order up a 99 cent hot dog and an order of deep fried oreos.After a LONG weekend of debauchery on the strip in Vegas, I was feeling nauseous and had absolutely no desire to be flown up in the air in a helicopter. Feeling nauseous + motion sickness = no bueno. 

My girlfriends were not going to take my complaining and were relentless in forcing me to go on the tour with them... eventually I found myself climbing aboard the helicopter and ready to embark on the 15ish minute adventure. The tour of the strip was average, nothing to really Ooh and Awe about other than that you're in a helicopter. Our pilot was a funny guy but he didn't say much about what we were flying over or looking at. I had a great time mainly because I was with good company but it's one of those one-time kind of deal. It was pricey and I don't know how exciting it can be looking at the tops of buildings... I'd just go back home to San Francisco to do that.It's A Grind has been a place that I'll end up at with my partner(s) in crime after a long night.  We love to wind down with some coffee and conversation, and It's A Grind makes for a great place to do just that.  24 Hour coffee shop?  With board games to help entertain yourself?  Yes please.  If you stop by and see me there, challenge me to a game of Othello.  I would say that I play this game 90% of the time I stop by here, and I barely lose, so bring it on!  

It's A Grind offers customers a selection of coffee, smoothies, blended coffee drinks, sandwiches, pastries, cigarettes, cigars... You can kill some serious time here depending on what you enjoy.  Overall I enjoy the fact that this place is 24 hours, but other than that it's just another coffee shop.  If it weren't for their hours, I don't think I would stop by so often.After almost a year, decided to try this place again. It was a random, last minute choice. Noticed they remodeled the place...NICE! 

My group of 6 and I, decided to dine in. Place looked very welcoming and so, why not?! Our server (didn't get his name) young guy was extremely helpful and was very attentive of our needs. Immediately took our drinks orders, and brought out a basket of garlic knots-on the house! Knots were fresh out of the oven, cheesy and soft. 4/5. 

I ordered their chicken fingers and fries from the lunch menu and they were BOMB.COM! Someone in my group ordered wings and a pep Stromboli, but they were not too pleased. The server never failed to come for refills and was on point at all times. 

I've tried them prior to remodeling and have always been satisfied with their pizza. Today's visit also was pleasant. Overall, 3/5.We got a Pain au Raisin and Banana Nut Muffin with 2 coffees.  They were good, but given the expensive price tags, it's only 3stars worthy.  Honestly I've had better pastries.

BTW, you can't charge it to the room because they are not associated with the hotel!  Lame!$5 any burger with a side on Mondays!  That's worth the trip but this place has lost some of its Irish charm and seems grungier.  It is a good place to catch live music & a variety of beers.   For big sporting events be sure to show up early or else you'll be stuck with standing room.  Also plan on walking a little for parking.Newly remodeled, the Pink Pepper in Mesa has long been one of our favorite lunch time destinations. Serving both menu items and a diverse if somewhat "Americanized" Thai buffuet. However the quality of the food has suffered at The Pink Pepper over the previous year, with more gristle on the chicken and less pork and beef present in those dishes on the buffet line.

The food recently was disappointing, not having the usual "kick" one expects Thai food to have. When we asked the owner if there had perhaps been a chef change his replay was "No, no changes, all the same". But it wasn't the same and that is a shame.

We will try Pink Pepper again of course, after all we have been going for years and a few off days should not deter us. But I must say that we were a bit dissappointed.went here with friends a few months ago. the food was quite tasty - a bit pricey, but the booze is where they lose a few stars. i ordered a shot of butterscotch schnapps with baileys. the drink has had a few different obnoxious names since the first time i had one years ago, so i described it instead of naming it. the bill came out and i was charged $10.00 for it. for a shot?! what a rip! waiters were nice and brought us extra placemats. we asked for extra because they were kind of cool - replicas of old news stories on a parchment-type paper. we took some home as souvenirs.This became backup spot to watch the NBA games on my last visit here.
The place is actually quite big and has an impressive Beer List. The prices can be shocking at times for some hard to find beers (20$+ for a pint) so make sure you check the price before you order.
On the several trips here I had tried the pub burger (forgetful), Short Rib flat bread (average) and fried chicken liver (enjoyable).  They have an interesting make your own burger like the Burger Bar in Mandalay Bay Resort  (with a lot less options) . My buddy concocted his own creation and commented it actually tasting better than the Burger Bar.  
The place can get quite busy and the service can get spotty. 
I tried the mojito's here once too and found it quite weak so we ended up ordering an extra shot of rum to make it right (the server was surprised when we did that).
Happy Hour has decent deals with $ slider and wings and buy one get one free domestic pint.
One of the better pubs in Vegas IMO.
3.5 Stars.I was convinced, by the Man, to give In-n-Out a second try.  So, since we were in Vegas, we did.

We got there at Lunch Rush... and this location is right next to UNLV.

Be forewarned.  

The place was packed in like sardines, with people oozing everywhere.

So.  We ordered.  Animal Burgers.  Animal Fries.  

Waited about 15-20 minutes for our food.  (Seriously??)

I actually watched our burgers "sit" on the counter (there are no heat lamps here, people) while our fried were prepared.  For a good 3-4 minutes they sat there.  

Suffice it to say this place could use some serious expo-of-food-organization help.

Anyway.  The food, for what is is ($7.50) was fine fast food fare, as it was the first time we tried In-n-Out.  The fries this time were hot, though, and tasted better under their onslaught of melted processed cheese slice, cooked onions, and thousand islan... Uh, I mean "Spread."

Other than that?  It's a Fast Food Place.  They may rave about their "Fresh Cut" fries and their "Never Frozen Beef"... but I still wouldn't eat one of their patties on its' own, without the helping hand of a LOT of cheese, bun, and "spread."

So.  It is what it is.  I'd eat it again, but I don't forsee any insurmountable cravings for In-n-Out any time soon.Its a big movie theater and i went to go see bad teacher opening weekend, but i was in the smallest theater ever i think that they should have given it a bigger theater.The Smoothies here are really good and the service is ok. I would rather go here than Starbucks any day. The prices are a little higher though. Don't be scared of their coffee either Nordstrom is from Seattle after all.Bring your own chair if busy. Free wi-fi?? Neon room was cool but a little too dark. The place is hard to get to because of the one way access. Had to drive against traffic.Man, this place is strange to me. 

First of all, they have a ton of different kinds of bagels. Bagels with toppings, with things in them, in sandwich form... whatever. And they're all good, sure. AND they have like 20 different kinds of cream cheese. All Wins, right? So why is this place three stars? 

Price. It just doesn't make sense to me that I could order a regular bagel, a bagel that has stuff like a sandwich, and two drinks and spend $15. That seems pricey to me considering the food was good, but not $15 good. 

I'll probably come back to this place again, but it won't be my first choice for eating in the area.Just Ok.   Popovers, corn muffins Ok.   $20 for 8 slices of tomato just Ok.  Clam and corn chowder was good.   But the frito misto seafood salad was subpar - the breading was too heavy and too salty for the seafood, and the heavy sauce had a weird flavor.   Caesar salad was just Ok.  Will likely not return even though I'm in the Wynn Tower Suites with elevators that open near the Tableau entrance.Stayed at the hotel with my husband for a Christmas week. Nice clean hotel. Very pretty pool area. We stayed at the Palace Tower with a pretty cool view at the pool area. Big bathroom with 2 sinks, huge mirror, jacuzzi , big glass shower and toilet in the separate room. Big room with king bad, bar, sitting area with sofa and chairs. Hallway with big closet, and special area for girls to get ready (loved it!). Totally worth the money.

What I didnt like was:
-too many families with kids (kids and Vegas doesnt go together)
-hard to find smth to eat at 4am within the hotel  (come on, its Vegas!!!)I wrote a favorable review for Raffles, and The Noodle Shop is next door...or rather in Raffles or an appendage thereof.  You would think they shared the same kitchen

This is a different review...I did not enjoy my won ton soup with noodles..It was bland and tasteless.  Perhaps, I cant remember enjoying a soup less..and I am happy with Campbells

Yet at the same time, everyone seemed to enjoy their selections:  Fried rice, Orange beef, Marinated chicken, Pad thai, Veggie spring rolls

So what am I saying?  Go to The Noodle Shop except for Noodles?This has to be the largest Forever 21 I have ever been to! Normally I find that Forever 21's website has a better selection than the stores, but since this store is ginormous, it has seriously ever single thing that the website does...plus more it feels like! It's neatly arranged with more of the party type clothes (tops, dresses, etc) up front and the more casual items toward the back. As a bonus, there is a men's section toward the back in a corner room. 

I definitely recommend trying stuff on at Forever 21...it's definitely helpful because some stuff that looks "long" on the hanger ends up being hoochie mama short once on! I do not recommend going into this store if you are short on time...it takes awhile to go through all the clothes; plus depending on when you go, the line for the dressing room can be long (note: they only allow you to try on 6 items at a time), and checkout can take time. So if you only have 15-20 minutes, keep on walking. 

However, the time in the store can be worth it because after spending 45 minutes (at least) in this store, I walked away with a NYE dress for $15!After another Tampa Bay Buccaneer loss today, there's only one thing that could turn this frown upside down... Cupcakes! Unfortunately, I haven't had the best luck finding decent cupcakes in Phoenix. 

I stopped at Urban Cookies today? Or is it Ollie Cake? Is it both?... Who's on first? 

They had a good selection of cupcakes. I got six and a slice of pumpkin bread. I will say the pumpkin bread was delicious, moist, good spice/pumpkin flavor. I liked it a lot. Then there were the cupcakes...

I got six: Carrot cake, Strawberry, Coconut, Birthday cake, Brown velvet and Smore

The first five were unsatisfying to say the least. The cake was mostly moist, not bad, but I didn't like the texture or consistency of the icing at all. It has an oily, thick consistency. I still have the nasty film on my tongue. The strawberry was the worst. 

I actually scrapped the icing off the strawberry one because I couldn't stomach putting it in my mouth. It reminded me of pink lard. I actually was playing with it in my hand like a small child because I was enamored by how greasy it was. 

My hand was water proof at this point so I broke out the Dawn, and started washing my hands like an oil covered sea bird. 

Though all was not lost! There was an exception. The Smore cupcake... Winner. Winner. Chicken dinner. This one cupcake was five star. The cake was moist. There was crunchy (I'm assuming) graham cracker in the cake, very good... and then the topping was toasted marshmallow... glorious. 

So all was not lost, but neither was this visit a great success. The search for my favorite cupcake shop in Phoenix continues.Can't say anything bad about the place. The food is okay. I brought my daughter with some of her friends there after the movies. They ordered chicken strips, French dip, burgers, and a big cookie desert.

They seemed to enjoy the meal. It was a good place to bring the kids.This is a small place. If you weren't looking for it you'd pass it for sure. I ordered this to eat for lunch at work one day. I called ahead and they told me how long it would take. I got there a little before the time they gave and the employees were kind of picking fun at my accent. The food was cold and the only real item that had any flavor was the chicken and it was smothered in barbecue sauceNot bad at 3:30am after drinking and clubbing your @$$ off. Get the cajun chicken quesadilla. Take it up to your room and eat if you don't wanna deal with bad service at 3:30 in the morning.Came here for dinner two weeks ago, after first sitting down at Pappa Razzini's a few doors down.  After waiting more than 10 minutes there w/out a glass of water to pass away the time reading the menu (I couldn't find anything that piqued my interest), I decided to try my luck at Miele's, instead.  Within 5 minutes, I had already chosen my selection AND had ice-cold water in front of me!

I'd already had their white pizza last year (lovely crispy thin-crust and awesome ricotta!), so I decided I'd try their penne pasta chicken alfredo, which came w/ bread and butter.  Delicious, and I'd order it again!  I also tried the tiramisu, which was served in a cocktail glass, sprinkled w/ cocoa and topped w/ two pirouline cookies!  It was light and refreshing.  Just perfect (but not really a great choice for someone w/ a new-found chocolate allergy)!

I'll be back!3 Stars for the food, zero stars for the ambiance/noise/parking.  Maybe that's why they have the words 'drive'thru' in their name.  I got the Kitchen Sink salad, added Chicken.  It was fine, and a decent price.  But the noise level in the restaurant was so incredibly loud that my friend and I actually would just burst out laughing because we coudn't hear a word that either was saying.  Throw in a blender and then random music being turned up even louder just for good measure and it just became comical.  I would go back for the food and bring it back to my desk, but would never actually eat there again.I got my bearded dragon, Loki (pictures at lokibd.blogspot.com) from this Petsmart. She is happy, healthy, and growing like a weed, so I appreciate that they buy healthy animals and do seem to take good care of them. However, a few times I have gone in there I have gotten bad advice from a few employees. For example, feeding a baby dragon mealworms is generally a bad idea as they cannot process mealworms' hard shells. One employee told me they feed their babies mealworms all the time, and tried to get me to buy some rather than crickets.

Do your own research before trusting a pet store employee; they care for dozens of animals every day, all with their unique care requirements, and don't have the time or resources to devote to making sure your particular breed of reptile/amphibian is getting the best care.

The store is bright and clean, and when they have dog adoptions they are in a large but fairly out-of-the-way spot from the rest of the store, so you aren't tripping over cages as you shop. Their stock of reptile accessories is pretty good.Someone here does not care about his job. Now this is usually not true about the Bookman's employees I have encountered over the years.

Maybe it is because he is old...or just had a bad day.  He did not even glance at all the trade I was bringing in...before flat out telling me no.

As I said..this is usually never a problem.  Yet I always visit the 19th ave location because it is closer.  So for a change of pace we sometimes visit this location.  I always seem to find something here....actually found 2 items I have been wanting.  But changed my mind on after the issue at the trade counter.Really liked the look and feel, but service was pretty slow even though we were being served by the owner. The food was just okay, nothing special. Maybe would consider trying it again, but for the price I could go somewhere better.This panaderia on 32nd street can be intimidating to any non-spanish speaker since the staff and the majority of the customers of this panaderia do not speak english. I stumbled upon this panaderia one afternoon with my friend Dani, I was craving a donut or some kind of postre. The churro at Del Taco was not going to do it for me, and lo and behold I came upon this treasure of a panaderia. I was half expecting someone to at least understand me but sadly not. It was abuzz with people. The store is part bakery part cafeteria where you can buy menudo and other hot snacks, and sit at the tables to eat. As you walk in and after the tables there are shelves of desserts and pastries filled with cookies, donuts, and the like, so grab a tray and pick and choose! And they're all CHEAP. I think one time we got ourselves close to 20 different kinds of goodies and paid a whopping $7.50. It was awesome. You have to admit that if a business doesn't understand english, they understand the language of currency. But yea, this was the kind of place where if you had any questions, you were left to your own devices to distinguish and determine what baked goods they were and if such tasted good. I think we were amusing as the non-spanish speaking pair playing charades to the spanish speakers to understand us. Oh well, it's an experience and I will come back!I can always find something I want in this store.  They have great home decor options as well as dishes, glasses, and linens.  Similar prices to Pier One or Bed Bath and Beyone but I think higher quality and more classic styling.  They also have some furniture and lighting options that I think are a little overpriced but still nice.  They have excellent after Christmas sales so check them out on the 26th!Okay place. Never really too packed. Night owls come here more often and they only have ONE lane open. A little cleaner than other Walmarts in the area.Tons of TV's & a good menu of bar food. We went here to watch a NW college football game and eat/drink before the Territorial Cup at ASU. The draft beer selection is just okay but there are a ton of TV's so you can get whatever game you want on a conveniently placed screen. As a California native I'm always a little weirded out by bars imitating a California beach bar outside of California, like Tavern on Mill, but at least this bar supports the Chargers. The crowd at the bar seemed full of tools & bro ho's but I'm not sure if that's the bar or if that's just the ASU football game crowd. The place was practically empty when we got there around 1 pm but completely full by 5:30 (7:30 ASU-AZ game). I had:

- Spicy Caesar Salad: Decently fresh but rather small. The menu doesn't say it but the salad comes with a mini quesadilla which was a nice addition. I thought the dressing was yucky and would recommend just using some salsa instead.
- Taco: I subbed black beans in for the meat and overall it was a good taco. Nothing special but not bad either. It comes with unremarkable chips,
- Mozzarella Sticks: Normal mozzarella sticks with good marinara sauce. If you're looking for an app to share I would recommend the nachos instead.
- Tater Tots: Love bars that have tater tots because they are never bad.You can't understand a word the lady says through the drive through. Great foodTried this place last Sunday, for our father's day "cheat meal". I had high hopes and was strongly craving some decent mexican seafood. Upon entering we noticed that there was a guy set up in the back with a laptop and some really loud speakers DJ-ing ranchero music. I am unclear if this was because it was father's day or if this is the normal scene on weekends. Either way the music was so loud you cannot hear the waitress or each other.

We ordered a large shrimp cocktail and a shrimp quesadilla to share. Service time wasn't super quick, but we weren't in a huge hurry so this wasn't a major issue. The waitress brought us some chips and a good greenish colored salsa - I am assuming it was tomatillo based. A little while later we received our cocktail and our quesadilla. Both were ok, but the shrimp in each had the mudvain still intact. The cocktail was on the watery side but did contain a decent amount of shrimp (albeit dirty shrimp) and avocado. The quesadilla was cheesy and overstuffed. I picked out the shrimp with an obvious mudvain and continued to eat the quesadilla because it did have a good flavor.

The wait for our check was excessive and we eventually had to flag down the waitress to request the bill. I am doubtful that I will eat here again, but I have heard from friends that the other items on the menu are pretty good.Well I agree with Marisa this Safeway is dark and small....but it is near my apt. and the points for gas program is very good. However be advised if you don't have you shopper saver's card....the staff is not really helpful in making sure you get the deal unless someone is in line that is willing to let you use there's. There is also a very small Wells Fargo branch at this locale but overall the store seems very dull and in some ways uninviting.

They do have great weekly deals though and this is why I gave it at least 3 stars....and again since it is near my apt. I can grab those deals and head back home in a timely manner. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!I was walking around Glendale glitters and seen Spiderman in the window so I decided to come into check it out the girl behind the counter was very friendly she did make up I contact with me and acknowledged us being there and say welcome which was pretty nice to have a lot of cool little magazines and knickknacks and they do sell T-shirts, Hard-to-find ones I've never seen it's not the best looking store in the world it is kind of dated but it is a little fine you might want to come check it out if your big comic book fanI'm going to have to say this place is hit or miss. Unfortunately there is no way of knowing what the inventory is until you get there, but that's all part of the allure. The prices are great and the inventory is well organized.A bit too expensive and far to go out of my way for. $16ish per pound of cookies is ridiculous. It's great that they have the free half dozen for yelp check ins and are willing to combine it with other deals.This is a nice cheap hotel to stay in while visiting Las Vegas if you're on a budget. I've stayed here about 3 times and the rooms were always clean and in good shape. There's a nice bowling area, movie theater, buffet, casino, and concert area in this hotel. The pool area is also pretty nice to wind down after spending the day on the strip.

The Garden buffet is pretty decent for a buffet. I would definitely go early to the buffet as it gets really crazy in there (people fighting for trays and food). My only gripe with this place is that the shuttle service they provided before is no longer in effect (shuttle would drop everyone off at the Mandalay Bay until 12am). Plan on getting a rental car if you're not a local, or spend an hour or more on some dirty city bus to get you there.

This place gets a great deal of business, so any rooms you may have reserved from a third party site should be followed up with a phone call to a front desk associate.My boyfriend and I have just returned from a three night/weekend trip to Vegas and this was our first time staying at South Point. We were swayed to try it because of great deals. 

I would give this more of 3 1/2 stars, but am going lower due to the inability to do half ratings.

Pros- Lots of food options, great sushi place, inexpensive in every way, low limit tables, good entertainment choices, we saw a great comedy show, clean rooms, spacious rooms, nice staff, great coupon book with many deals, low resort fee

Cons- everywhere has bright lights and bad 80's cruise ship decor, not a very "vegas" feel, lots of kids and families, the pool was a concrete jungle, very cold pool temp, room bathtub was very shallow, the lighting in the bathroom was bad for getting ready, too far from the strip unless you have a car (we did)

I've stayed at most of the strip hotels and South Point simply does not compare. It doesn't feel like you are in Vegas. However, we were happy with it as far as it provided a clean place to sleep and gave us tons of money saved to spend on the strip.

I would stay here again if the room was cheap/free and if it was during a season in which I wouldn't want to use the pool. If the weather was nice for the pool, I would not pick this hotel.

The sushi restaurant was good enough to make the drive specifically to eat at the restaurant. 

.Easy to find, nice atmosphere, really good food, I would return.I always have to check out Sheik.  I have bought Jordans from them before and if they sold fake ones, I hope they would get a better selection.  I have not shopped at this Vegas one, but never had a problem with Sheik.  I only comment because I hate fake Jordans and the pair I bought is from 8 years ago and if they were fake, they would have fallen apart already.  They are the IX white grey and navy.Located between Binions and the Golden Nugget on four blocks of downtown Las Vegas is one of best marketing efforts this part of town has enjoyed in decades ... the Fremont Street Experience.

Fremont Street is covered in a long canopy called Viva Vision with 12 million lights and 550,000 watts of sound entertaining tourists with short free light and music shows every evening on the hour.

Current Schedule (Changes regularly)
  7:00 pm: American Freedom 2 (Fri/Sat. only)
  8:00 pm: Heart - Crazy on Vegas
  9:00 pm: Bon Jovi - Wanted in Vegas
10:00 pm: The Who - Miles over Vegas
11:00 pm: The Doors - Strange Days
12:00 am: JVH - Signs of Life
  1:00 am: A Tribute to Queen (Fri/Sat. only)

Along Fremont Street, you'll find 10 classic (old) casinos with dozens of restaurants and lots of cheap gambling opportunities compared to most casinos on the Las Vegas Strip. This historic street is where gaming began in Nevada in 1931 besides being the first paved street in the city or first street with a traffic light.

The Fremont Street Experience began in 1995 with the closure of the street to form a 7-block outdoor mall. It was obviously enhanced with Viva Vision 10 years ago.  What's next? Who knows .. a holographic Elvis, Michael Jackson, and Frank Sinatra trio?

When you bore of the fun options on the LV Strip, simply want to enjoy some free entertainment, or need to find a casino with lower minimum tables and slot machines, then Fremont Street Experience is waiting in historic downtown Las Vegas, Nevada.Okay, I REALLY want to give this place 5 stars, but the service is just terrible. The food is amazing. The fresh spring rolls and peanut sauce are some of the best I have ever had, but every time I go (and I go, often) I wait 20 minutes just for my drink, and the food will take another 20-30 min, and then no one ever checks on me.

If you aren't in a hurry and don't care about service, then you should be fine.Not the best Hilton property I have stayed in, but convenient for my work trips to LV.  Housekeeping staff has a real issue with leaving sugar in the coffee service for those of us that choose not to use yellow, blue, or pink chemical sweeteners.  Even after numerous complaints to the desk staff, they still don't get it.   Trash is not always emptied and they sometimes do not replace coffee or clean the coffee maker.  I will probably continue to stay here, but am looking for another convenient property.  Nice fitness center and pool, friendly bar/restaurant staff and good dinner specials.Read reviews before heading to have my SUV washed. I told the guy I wanted the platinum for $29.99. He immediately told me he would give me a great deal on a full detail because they had no other cars currently being detailed. The price: $59.99. My SUV is 9 months old and in mint condition. I told him, no thank you. I just want the platinum. He shook his head, threw his arms up in the air and exasperated, "Ha? But the detail is cheaper!" I replied, "No. It's not cheaper. It's $30 more. I just thought this was rude behavior. The cleaning was fine. Inside looked great but there were still water marks on the outside and some spots that had not been cleaned. I will go some where else next time.This place was very difficult to find and the store fronts in the Grand Canal Shoppe were not helpful in finding this place. And surprisingly, neither was the security guard! 
After paying at the front desk by the Canyon Cafe and the rock climbing wall, the Women's locker room was so far away. You walk down an endless hallway with lots of different painted colored walls and turns. You literally feel lost!

The spa itself was ok. I went room by room to scope out the scene for the 3 hours I was there. Gave each room a good 30 min to chill out and try to take it all in... I excepted much more. 
- The showers had (note "had") a eucalyptus spray that infused the shower but now it's just a dangly wire with 2 green beads? Weird that the product was discontinued but that thing just hangs there with a large sign to "Try it out."
- The Aquavanna room is a small spa for 6 people, 2 of those seats were tiled lounge seats. It was a tight fit to get 6 people in there.
- The Aroma room is a semi-sauna with indian chanting and good smelly stuff steaming "herb scented air." 
- Was definitely not impressed with the Igloo - a small room (not sure if its meant for a few people or a private experience) but a cold mist/stream of water shoots down over you... and it smells pretty...?
- The Experiential showers (i think that's what it was called?) was like the Igloo - smaller shower with Carribean storm, Tropical thunder, and some other "experience." It was cold, weird and couldn't get into it. It was like sitting under a sprinkler with club lighting and white noise.
- Long... I mean LONG.... hallways. What, again?!?!?! It took a long while to get to the co-ed areas like the Conservancy, Wave room, and the Salt room. 

I'd give this place a whirl again, IF and only IF I had a treatment scheduled. Would not recommend for the facility day use. Sorry!A wide, modernized-American style space, nice air, nice people, good vibe. Egg Works definitely has a good feel to it, which I think is absolutely critical for a breakfast place. The morning has to feel good, especially for the unfortunate noon-waking types. 

The staff is friendly, though not spectacular (which they have the potential of being), but they do work efficiently and cleanly. The food is nothing too special; a little too rich, even for American food, and there's the unnecessarily huge servings of thick, saucy food even if you're expected to have morning-dessert afterwards. You could easily split an entree with someone else, and be happier in the end for it for not feeling so mayo-greased. I did appreciate how fresh the vegetables were, and the solid arrangement of the layers in my eggs benedict (which is important), but then the excess food and servings is just such a huge turn-off, especially when the flavors are so monotone that it all eventually becomes one huge unnecessary mouthful. 

What I'd like to see is some more use of those excellent veggies and construction to create a bit more interest to the breakfast dishes. I'm not saying that they should be doing culinary acrobatics here, breakfast place and all, but they could stand to reduce sizes so that guests are not one-flavor-drowned, or to add a bit more interest to these huge dishes to warrant them being so size expansive.They have healthier options like brown rice and white meat which is always a plus :)
My only problem with this place is that it can be very slow. I guess it's because they won't cook your food until you order them, so it's not really a fast food joint which I guess is a good thing. So don't come here if you're in a hurry or order in advanced. Other than that this place is pretty awesome after a workout since it gives me (good) carbs and protein.This is not your typical hotel in Vegas. Located on Las Vegas Blvd., Tahiti Village is not on the strip yet still close enough from all the" happening". What I like about this place is the fact that there is no casino here which means it's kid friendly and no smell of smoke everywhere.  The rooms are nice because they come with a kitchen that is fully furnished, a breakfast counter, dining area, a separate living room area that has a convertible sofa bed, washer/dryer, separate bed and bath, and a balcony. Not that you would want to cook while in Vegas but it's convenient if you stay long or if you have children that you need to feed whenever they are hungry. If by chance you are here when the weather is really hot, the lazy river is an awesome amenity for kids and adults alike.

My only complain on my last visit here is the housekeeping service. I don't recall it being that way in the past but our suite was not made up for the three days that we were here. Luckily, we're not messy guests but that would've sucked if we were. Oh and the 1st sink in the bathroom was leaking. We called it in on the 1st night but no one came to fix it during our stay. There were two sinks in the bathroom so that wasn't a problem for us. It only goes to show they need work on their maintenance. 

Overall, Tahiti Village is a nice place to stay if you are travelling with a family or a big group. They offer adjoining suites which we have used in the past when there were 12 of us visiting Vegas. We all fit comfortably and enjoyed our stay here. Just right behind the hotel is also an outlet store for those of you interested. Lots of parking is available in the structure as the private lot gets full fast. Make sure you leave your parking permit on the dashboard of your car. 

NOTE: On top of what you pay each night, a resort fee is charged to your card upon checkout. 

I've stayed here quite a few times in the past and have always been a fan. It's just disappointing that my recent experience here was not that great. I know I'll still consider staying here if travelling with a group but I just hope service will be a great improvement next time.Kinda dirty, I haven't been to a food-4 less in a long while but I didn't think it would have changed like that. Somehow the cleanliness of the store just wasn't there.This review of Panevino Deli Cafe (PDC), just off Sunset across from the airport, is based on at least twenty visits over the past year. The deli, which opened about 10 years ago, promotes itself as an upscale gourmet Italian deli with upscale prices to match. It's geared more to locals and business persons than tourists though I have seen tour buses at the restaurant before. Whereas the attached Panevino Restaurant has a great view of the airport and the Strip, the deli generally looks to the south and southwest out over the parking lot and adjoining commercial/business district (though the view over the restaurant's courtyard is nice). Panevino also offers private banquet facilities. My Yelp review is only for the deli which is open from 11:00AM to 5:00PM, Monday through Friday except holidays.

The deli space is fairly large and clean and has the look of a modern deli with its large glass windows, wood paneling and Italian-esque decorations. The staff is friendly and efficient. The lunch menu offers full- or half-portion Italian salads, fairly large sandwiches and hot main dishes. The deli also offers a selection of various Italian side salads, 3 different soups and quite a selection of pastries, cookies, gelato and sorbetti. The eating area offers 20 or more tables indoors and 4 or so outdoors (mostly for smokers). You place your order and pay the tab at the cash register and wait for your number to be called. Some days they are crowded at lunchtime but the order usually comes out in 5 - 10 minutes. Sandwiches are served in baskets with either a bag of chips or a small portion of average tasting coleslaw or another salad (in a small plastic container -- probably 2-3 ounces or so) while main dishes are served on clean white plates; both on a large fancy plastic tray. You pick up your own utensils, napkin, condiments and fountain drink. They also offer several different Italian sodas, flavored waters and other beverages.

Mostly when I eat at PDC I order a sandwich, chips and a soft drink. The overall quality of the meals I've been served is somewhat variable. I usually like the meatball sub with its three large warm meatballs, melted provolone cheese, tangy tomato sauce and sprinkled on Parmesan cheese served on a fairly large and crusty Italian roll but sometimes it is prepared with a different bread, cool meatballs and a sauce that is just not quite right. I've also had the French Dip (OK, sometimes fatty), the Reuben (greasy), Big Turkey (eh), and Grilled Chicken Club (OK) sandwiches as well as a few of their hot meals including Meat Lasagna (not like mom's -- her's is sublime) and Chicken Parmigiana (OK I guess). A lunch sandwich with chips and a small soft drink usually sets me back about $12.

PDC is a place I love to hate. It's convenient to my work. It offers a clean and attractive eating area as well as a friendly staff. My biggest disappointment is with the "meats" they put into the sandwiches -- they're just not what I'd expect from a gourmet deli. They don't seem to make these "from scratch" in their kitchen. It does not have the gourmet mouth-feel or taste to match the upscale prices. Is it really easier to serve processed turkey roll than it is sliced roasted turkey? What about the meatballs, the corned beef and the others? To me the deli-"meat" is obviously the reformed "roll" stuff that many restaurants like to use these days. Perhaps it is a "sign of the times" that restaurants sometimes use these industrial substitutes to lower costs or offer more choices; but for me, it just makes the food seem cheap and overpriced.

By the way, they now offer a customer loyalty card -- buy 9 lunches and get the 10th free. Warning: only one stamp per party (rather than per person or meal ordered).

-- 4.0 deserved stars for the beautiful deli and 3.0 disappointing stars for the deli foodWas helping my sister move. Not sure what to expect from a U-Haul. The staff was friendly and insured I knew everything I needed. It did take a long time but I would presume it's the nature of the business.This was the cheapest 2 bedroom we could find close to the strip.  The 2 rooms are divided up by a living room in the middle with a kitchen.  We chose this hotel based on those amenities.  

I did not know that there would be planes taking off all night directly over our heads or that we would be able to hear every car speeding down the side roads/freeway all night.  We were able to open the windows up in the room about 3 inches, but they wouldn't close...none of them!!  Called the front desk and they had no idea either.  The bed in our room had to be a Full Size bed and we found it to be extremely uncomfortable.  My husband and I kept bumping into each other all night because there was hardly enough room to move around.  There was at least a 12" gap between the nightstand and our bed so you know they easily could have fit a larger bed in the room.  The hotel and rooms were clean, plus the service was great so no complaints there.

They do offer a happy hour during the week...I think it was M-TH.  Hot dogs, salad and chili on the Thursday we were there.  Free breakfast in the morning was...well free.  I have had much better free breakfast at some other hotel chains.I got crabs this past weekend in Vegas...Joe's Stone Crabs, that is; what else did you think I was talking about?! 

This was my first time having stone crab claws & I thought they were just so-so. The texture was a little like a flakey white fish, dense & less sweet than Dungeness crab meat (my fave kind.) At over $10 per Large claw (an order comes with five), a taste of Joe's does not come cheap. And the mustard sauce (spicy from the horseradish) was good, but I'm going to call 'overhyped' on their namesake dish. 

The three of us also shared a crab cake entree ($24, too much breadcrumb filler), a salad & the 'Second Mortgage' appetizer ($16) which was the best thing we tried. I especially liked the jumbo prawn & shrimp & scallop ceviche that was included in the appetizer. 

Service from everyone we encountered was five stars-- very professional, but given that I've had better crab cakes at The Palm a few doors down & the stone crabs hit my wallet pretty hard, I'm giving their food a lukewarm three stars.

Getting (stone) crabs in Vegas-- not so yummy.Food was great. Went with the lasagna and would go back. Only reason I'm giving it 3 stars is that I showed up at 8:50 a few months back and the doors were locked! I guess he was trying to close up shop a little early. It was embarrassing to sit there are the door trying to open it with a bunch of diners still in there staring at my wife and I. Once we were in, they rushed us to get our order in which wasn't pleasant.

After all that, they were nice while cleaning up the store as we were eating.Used to be 4 stars, but now deduct 1 star. 

This place is a little far for boba places (wayy past LV Chinatown) however I've never had a bad experience where I would get a tummy ache(Volcano Tea), where someone wouldn't even remember me after 3 times (QQ Boba), and lastly where the cashier says to make my drink wrong..and did (Fresh Cup).

I would say this place is up to par with their jasmine MT - never had a problem and taste refreshing as it always has. They offer many sizes for their drinks - from 16oz, to 20oz in either the Tall or 24oz? Chubby cup, to lastly the Bucket cup which is 32oz. These sizes are pretty popular in SF so it didn't wow me too much - but was excited to find a place that did have it.. which is here!

I would say prepare for unfriendly customer service haha many of the cashiers look like they're in high school, and with that..comes the unfriendly customer service. I don't mind not being greeted when I enter the store, but to make eye contact with the cashier 3 times as I'm sitting across from her in a chair and still says nothing definitely doesn't mean make it any less awkward.Went to get the jeep cleaned, in and out in less then 30 minuites.
Clean inside and outHere I go again... more sugary goodness! Nielsen's is a cute little place next to Grimaldi's off of Eastern.  They will be moving soon across the street by Einstein Bagels...  which I'm sure I'll visit!  The ambiance of this place takes you back to a time of poodle skirts and blue suede shoes!  You'll notice the great old time decor with great oldies playing in the store.  

There are steps in choosing your custard and how you want it.  They have 4 flavors - vanilla, chocolate, strawberry and a flavor of the day.  Then you can choose what toppings you would like...  so many to choose from! The last step is to decide how you want it - cup, cone, sundae, concrete (which is like a blizzard).  You place your order and they will bring it out to you.  Nice!

I was in the mood for a 'concrete'.  I went with their flavor of the day Oreo and they blended in caramel and pecans.  Yum.  Unfortunately they only have one size for the concretes.   I knew it would be too much frozen custard for me.  It's just a very heavy and filling treat to indulge in everyday.  My suggestion would be to share with someone!  

The girls behind the counter were cheerful but professional.   They displayed great respect for their customers.   Great customer service all around.   I'm sure I'll be back to visit the new store but probably when I'm really hungry and can share!Coming to Envy was a simple choice -- it was located in the hotel that I was staying in on a business trip. I was looking forward to it after my boss, who is a foodie too, told me to try it. But anytime a restaurant has a coupon on Restaurant.com, I start to worry about the quality of their food. Nevertheless, because of convenience, my coworker and I went there for dinner one night. I had made a reservation through OpenTable but he beat me to the punch and called it in from his room. They greeted us by name and promptly sat us in a booth. The restaurant decor was nice and modern. 

We both had the warm spinach salad with goat cheese, pancetta, with a balsamic vinaigrette. It was delicious and started the meal off right. I had the bone-in filet which was pretty good but not the best I've had. Albeit, the price is $15-20 less than what you'd be paying on the strip and the entree came with complimentary sides (mashed potatoes and vegetables that weren't very good). My coworker ordered the burger of the month - Delicious Ode to Surf and Turf - 'Best of Both Worlds Burger' which had filet mignon and medallions of lobster tail. It was accompanied by the truffle-reggiano fries that I was also looking forward to. Too bad it just tasted like oil. The burger sounded too good on paper to be true. The toppings didn't fit, it was hard to eat and apparently did not sit well with him over night. 

Overall, it was a good experience for me. Great service, nice ambiance, decent food for the price (after the coupon) but I probably won't be back.The trump is a gorgeous, tastefully decorated, and sleek hotel. It has tons of space, smells like sweet flowers, and the service is wonderful. Needless to say, you wouldn't even know you were in Vegas until you looked out of your window! The one bedroom suite was fab though the pull out bed was crap but the mansion size master bathroom makes up for it all.

Sounds good so far doesn't it? DOESN'T IT?! Well here's the downside, I would not stay here again. Why? Well, my friends and I are in our 20's so we come to Vegas to be IN THE ACTION. In other words, we WANT a goddamn casino in our hotel, we WANT to step out of our hotel and be on the strip, anddd we WANT our hotel to be where the party's at! 

Sooo.. all this elegance that the Trump offers just isn't our style. So what if I got this room for $80/night on Priceline? I got the Mirage for $60/night on Priceline a few months before and guess what? WE WERE RIGHT SMACKDAD IN THE ACCION :)We had dinner here our first night in Vegas; we were coming in later and just wanted to have something light and quick before we headed out for the night.  We actually had to push our reservation back by an hour because we were delayed in AZ and they were more than happy to do that for us.  We also arrived before two of the members of our party and they were happy to seat us at our table.  

We ordered drinks to start and our friends arrived.  At this point it seemed as if we had several servers, which I normally don't mind- in fact I rather enjoy it, but there was no flow with these servers.  Nobody really knew what anyone was doing until we finally were able to mention to the one server we preferred him.  They took away our bread plates before we even had a chance to have bread and we asked for them back and they told us we didn't need them because the salads were coming right out.  Um, oookkkk.  For the record, the salads took a while.  (But were very good.)

The service picked got better as the night went on but I have to say I was really unimpressed.  It was definitely an inexpensive option (Dinner for 5 with two bottles of wine came to $262) but it was not fast (we were there for almost three hours) and not necessarily savory.  My margherita pizza was unremarkable and my dinner companions felt the same way about their meals.

Again, another disappointing experience at one of the Venetian's "casual" restaurants.Just got back from a "Sake Session" at Lucky Bar. I've been here a couple of times before. It's a pretty stylish little bar/lounge with a circular setup. They had your requisite gogo dancers and DJ mixing crowd-pleasing tunes. I'm not sure if it's like that every night.

On this occasion, it was completely free sake, so I can't complain at all. I've actually always hated sake, but I finally tried some a couple of months ago that didn't suck. It opened my eyes to the fact that good sake exists. Tonight, I didn't find a single one that I didn't enjoy. One of the stations was also mixing Asahi beer with flavored syrups. My clear cut favorite was the lychee. I love lychee anything.

Anyway, as for the bar itself, I can't really rate too much since I didn't order anything from the bar proper. It was nice that they took Hachi orders. A few people in the group ordered sushi and it was pretty tasty. The crowd tonight was pretty laid back and friendly.

I wouldn't go to Red Rock just for Lucky Bar, but it's a decent option if you're in the casino. I don't think there's a dress code and there has never been a line to get in. It's a good spot if you're looking for something somewhat upscale without all the usual hassles of a Vegas night club.This review pertains to the new lunch menu at Nora's Wine Bar.

The Skinny: torn between the absolutely divine gelato with the mediocre risotto (3.5) Service albeit busy ('cause the servers do the plating here!) but pretty attentive (3), value - great for lunch special - 3 course meal is $17 (4).

Yet another Vegas favourite haunt I perennially forget to review.

My hubby and I love to come here for lunch. Prices are more reasonable during the lunch and they usually treat you to a delightful basket of artisan breads, gourmet olive oils and salts from around the world. They also used to have a superb crepe lasagna available at lunch - lighter than most versions but utterly delicious. Sadly things have changed here with the new summer lunch menu.

Value wise - things are better. Although there is no longer a bread basket, the lunch special consists of a glass of sangria or soda, some crostini, a choice of entree, plus a housemade cart of 6 gourmet gelatos made by their pastry chef. All this is $17 - a steal really. You can also order off a truncated a la carte menu which has less complicated dishes than their dinner menu.

First of all, our entrees came before the said crostini which made me believe that the kitchen forgot about it completely. The crostini, consisting of roasted garlic and hummus, was lack-luster which was sad because the previous bread basket was so good.

My husband ordered a plating of 3 pastas: a risotto, a tomato penne, a spinach tortellini. The tortellini was excellent which was a shame because it completely overwhelmed the other two. The tomato penne was so-so, while the risotto was blatantly undercooked (don't tell me that risotto's supposed to be al dente 'cause I know you're lying). When we mentioned this to the server (who actually gave us two portions of pasta by mistake), he did give us some more tortellini.

My paninni was very good with very fresh mozzarella and prosciutto. The caesar salad was solid. 

Really, the highlight of the meal was the gelato/sorbetto cart at the end. Honey basil, nutella, pistachio, mango, lemon-verbena, coffee crunch - all flavours house made. Totally wow! My favourite was the honey basil - who knew you could make basil ice cream so good? Some of the best gelato is here folks, I kid you not!

So overall, conflicted as I was with the highs and lows of the meal, I give it a 3.5 star rating due to the consistency issues. If they can iron those issues out, this place could be solid 4 stars.planet hollywood is really nicely decorated especially for a much younger crowd! 

casino area was great, not as smokey and foggy as other hotels. after hours, they have hot go go dancers dancing near casino tables, called the pleasure pit. Great for men! but table prices go up

they have a great shopping center, but can have more of a variety in resturant choices. 

rooms are great! nice view, nice decor, bedding and set up. 2 minor things. Bathroom toilet door has no lock, and the shower is see through, so sharing the bathroom while geting ready can be a little tough if you have a bunch of insecured friends. other than that that the bathroom was good enough, great tub to soak your feet after walking in heels all day!  for some reason due to the painting of the room, it was always dark! haha weird. 

the pleasure pool was not good! proabably one of the worst pools i've ever seen at a hotel... they have two small pools on the oppsite ends of eachother, while being seperated by a resturant and a large parking lot for bodies to tan. The lot in between was larger than the two pools combined! wth. the pool layout can be so much better, it was so hard to find a spot unless you were invited to Cabanas. music was good though. weird part, pool was on the 6th floor.... i do not understand why...

overall layout was funky, but it was the  best spot on the strip, almost right in the middle of it, so taxi cabs were not so expensive. nice hotel and fairly priced if you book it with flight on expedia!We brought our daughter, her fiancé and her brother out to Vegas for her 21st birthday.  We had rooms at Flamingo but our VIP host found rooms a Planet that saved us about $80 and since this was my daughters original choice we switched hotels.  We got in very late so the hotel was full, the front desk clerk said he had two dbl queen rooms, or a suite that we would have to move from in two days or gave us the option of changing in the morning after checkouts.  We figured if we're spending more than 6 hrs in our room we should be beaten with a tack hammer anyway so we just kept our rooms. 
Rooms: very easy to find, clean and roomy, not much of a view, large bathroom and pretty quiet. Maid service was great.
Casino:  layout is a bit confusing, lots of walking in circles but that could be attributed to the drinks, they definitely aren't going to cheat you hear.  I do enjoy their sports book.  Actually being able to sit in the bar/lounge and watch all your games is nice and the bartenders are great.  Sat down for a few hours while the ladies shopped and grabbed a nap. My dealers Ellie and Yolanda were probably the two best I've encountered, lots of fun and helpful.
Overall it's about average.  For the younger crowd that's there to party I'm guessing they'd go 4 or 5 stars but for the parents I'll stay at 3 or 4.FINALLY!  after seeing this on tv and after going to vegas numerous times...i finally was able to get off the strip and make it over here!  was able to cross this off my list!

we came on a saturday night around 6PM.  there was alotta people outside already.  the wait was only about 40 mins. i expected it to be a lot longer!  

same concept as our infamous boiling crab.  we had the shrimp and the crawfish in the hot n juicy seasoning = our shabang sauce at boiling crab.  to be honest, if i never ate boiling crab i would prob really like this.  i have to say boiling crab wins though.  our flavors are so much more intense!  we had the an order of fries= ok and the wings were ok..they reminded me of the ones from the lunch truck.  prices by pound were a lot more then what we charge here. 

service is pretty good here.  everyone is pretty attentive.  

sorry hot n juicy but boiling crab still holds my heart!Here's the thing. It was 8 a.m. I had been up since 3:40 a.m. to catch a flight to Vegas. I was starving. Ocean One was the first restaurant I saw. Egg white omelet with veggies. Shit ton of salsa. Gallons of diet soda. Great service. CHEAP.

Can't speak to anything else, but breakfast sure as hell hit the spot.I've used the rental facility once or twice since it opened, and it's fine but nothing too exciting.  Would have been nice to see them build all of the rental car business IN the airport like they do at some airports.  I arrive on a Friday night and had to wait 15-20 minutes in line for the rental car shuttles.  Not sure if that's a regular Friday night thing or not, but I felt held hostage as the cab lines were probably longer.  On my return, the shuttle had to take a detour and the driver seemed a little confused... not what you want in a shuttle driver!First off, if you have a free ticket, make sure to line up EARLY. Free seats are up ib the balcony and if you have a short torso, you're better off sitting on your knees like I did! Also, make sure to get your FREE tickets in ADVANCE at the Flamingo.

Back to the show...For free, this is a decent show. Lots of illusion box cutting scenes, juggling, mask charades, and some humor that's hit or miss with the audience. If you have an afternoon to kill, try it out.We were hungry one night about 9 pm and the food court at the Fashion Mall was closing. Strip Burger was open so we figured we should try it out. I heard this place can get pretty packed but it wasnt a weekend so it wasnt too bad.
I realize its Vegas and they are trying to be hip and all that but the music was blasting WAY too loud. Actually I dont mind the loud music, but it made it almost impossible to hear the waitress and vice versa. She evidently didnt hear part of our order so it took a while before everything we ordered actually arrived to our table.
The bacon cheeseburger was pretty big and tasted pretty good. Not great but pretty much what you get at similar places for the same price. The garlic herb fries were good and one order is plenty to share with another person or two.
As we were seated, we walked through a conversation/arguement between a manager and waitress. Sounded like confusion and wrong orders going out are not unusual. Maybe it was just an off night.
If you have kids, I would suggest considering the age and appetite of the child before ordering off of the kids menu. For an 8 year old, the kids cheeseburger was pretty small.
The manager was really nice and attentive. He asked if we would like a heat lamp next to our table and he promptly brought one over and lit it for us.
Leaving took a little while also due to the waitress bringing us somebody elses check. The manager saw me looking around for the waitress and came over and got us the right check.
I think a lot of people would give less stars with the problems that we had but,  like I said before, it may have been an off night. The employees are friendly so I will give them the benefit of the doubt.We picked this spot on a Monday night because pretty much everything else on the strip was closed. In a pinch like that, it's pretty good. Wouldn't be my first choice otherwise. Or my second to be honest.

I ordered the acapulco burger. The meat was good, but the guacamole was kinda ehhhh. And I ended up removing the bun, really wasn't a fan although other people in our party did enjoy it.

The garlic-herb fries were pretty good, and one portion of fries is enough for 2-3 people. 

All in all, a decent late night meal.This mall used to kind of suck to me, but it's gotten a lot better.

Pros:
URBAN OUTFITTERS!!!
Neutral atmosphere, you never feel like you're not supposed to be there.
Generally laid back vibe.
While a lot more expensive than my usual shopping haunts Boulevard and Meadows, much more affordable than Caesars or anything else on The Strip really.

Cons:
Still too touristy.
Too much gimmicky stuff all throughout the mall(like that random light show or the weird fountain show in front of the V Theater).
Tries way too damn hard to be hip.

This has become a lot cooler place than it originally was, but, unfortunately, just like the rest of Planet Hollywood it still tries WAY too hard.Man this place is really a mixed bag.   

The pros:
Service is excellent.  Bruschetta is really good, and the dishes I have tried have all been from good to great.  Good specials and very reasonable prices.

The cons (and unfortunately they are SO con they bring it to 3 stars):
If you have ever seen the show restaurant impossible and the big muscle man walks into a place for the first time and is stunned by the decor that is this place!  This is definitely your grandma's house with less character.  Stuff everywhere, no consistent theme, pastels, dark corners, and the list goes on.  

As others have said, Surprise is a mix of young families and retirees/snowbirds.  If you go to this place during snowbird season and you are under 60, you are GOING to be the youngest person there.  I can deal with that, living here you get used to it from Nov-April.  What I do not like is what seems to be a constant attitude by the clientele of this particular restaurant.   I do not see this at other establishment in Surprise that the snowbirds frequent.  Another review said you will get "the eye".  I get more like the evil eye!   I have 8 & 10 year old kids who we have taken here and that mere act gets you dirty looks like you just invaded their personal space by entering the door.  I cant quite put my finger on why THIS restaurant seem so much more intensely snowbird driven than others, but it is enough to keep from going back more a few times a year.I went here with a group of friends to celebrate a friend's birthday.  We brought a cake in with us as we do that for each other's birthdays.  When we first walked in, the first thing we get from the host is that they do not allow outside foods.  We then have to walk all the way back to our car to put the cake away in the AZ heat.  That put a sour taste in my mouth before I even looked inside the restaurant or sat down.  From a far, this restaurant has a nice patio entrance/area perfect for a warm night (if no one ruins it by smoking there).  They do not have a lit up sign of their restaurant that can be easily seen.  However, food is actually really good here.  I had the braised BBQ pork on talera bread and loved it.  It comes with a side of ceasar salad with options to upgrade to fries or sweet potato fries and other sides.  You can expect a tasty variety of sandwiches, burgers and other full meals from this place.  Our waiter was courteous and on top of things too.  Be aware of the 20% gratuity for 6 or more people.  Really?  This is a nice casual place, not a fancy black tie restaurant.  At the end of our meal the birthday person didn't even get a free dessert.  I would normally give this kind of restaurant at least 4 stars...but not tonight.FINALLY! Passable sushi in Madison.

Do not be put off by the 3 star rating--I can assure anyone reading this that Takumi's sushi is the best in Madison, and getting 3 stars here is an accomplishment. That statement may lead you to believe that I'm a bit of a prick when it comes to judging food...and you'd be right. However, I am most critical of sushi, by far.

Rundown:

I went to Takumi for lunch with a couple of friends. I got the sashimi and sushi combo--4 pieces of each, soup/salad, and a spicy tuna roll. The salad was excellent, but aren't they all? That ginger dressing is addicting.

Sashimi: It came with 4 pieces--yellowtail, basic tuna, salmon, and what I believe was mackerel (unsure). I like leaving it up to the chef to choose--they know what's fresh. Tuna and mackerel were so-so. Mackerel...maybe not so fresh. Yellowtail was fresh and quite good. Salmon was very good and the best of the bunch--you can usually tell by looking at the fish what quality it is, and this was excellent.

Sushi: Tuna, yellowtail, salmon, shrimp. Shrimp is the only difference here, and it was good...but most shrimp is good. No surprises.

Spicy tuna roll: Quite good...even though it was a roll! They threw in some tempura pieces/toasted panko, and it gave the roll a nice crunch. I approved and ate it all. Delicious.

So, there you have it--this place is the best in Madison...by far. Takara, Red Sushi (awful), Muramoto--Takumi trumps all of them. Would I go back? Yes, definitely. Especially at $14.75 for that massive fish combo. Sushi coma.The best and worst thing about this store is that the dresses were really really cute.  Authentic 40s and 50s styled dresses abounded, some even on end-of-summer-sale, but all this water and not a drop to drink: even their Large dresses wouldn't fit my boobs.  I was bummed.  For some reason I thought they'd fit me because Bettie Page had larger boobs, but no such luck.  

My favorite part of the store: in a darkened corner, under a sign reading 'Complaints and Returns," a mannequin dressed to appear like Bettie in bondage held a whip.  Funny.  Cute store!Convenience for a reasonable price,,,thats it.. no frills.......Best locationThe food is decent but this place is really, really loud.  I do not like going here on date night because I cannot hear my wife.

The food is salty or sugary, but still tastes good; it's nothing special though.

We go here maybe four times a year; not a bad place before catching a flick at the red rock regal cinema.One word: Lunch special....wait TWO words. Haha.

Decided to hit up this place cause it's down the street from my work and it was a short lunch for me. Got the lunch special - their lunch special you get: miso soup, salad, and two of the meat items -- I got the chicken teriyaki and tonkatsu. 

I put my order in and had my co-worker pick it up, apparently on their menu, you're supposed to get gyoza, tamago and inari sushi. But I didn't get that. Oh well.

Price is decent and quality is okay. Would come back to try out their rolls.CPK is one of the first of many restaurants to open at Tempe Marketplace. While the restaurant is one of my favorites, the new location didn't quite blow me away during a lunch time visit with some coworkers this afternoon. Our server looked like he was 10 and took forever to bring our drinks. My peach lemonade (CPK is known for their mouthwatering flavored lemonades) had just a dash of peach syrup so you could barely taste the peach. And there was something off about the mac 'n' cheese, which I usually love. The cheese seemed to be extra runny today. While this dish, which isn't on the menu, is one of my favorites, it didn't delight at the new CPK. The highlight? The tasty key lime pie. Yum!!!

 I imagine the restaurant will get better in time. It's the first week it's opened so I'm taking this into account and will return again in a few weeks to see if it's up to par.We stopped in here on a Friday night about 30 minutes before close. The staff seemed very nice, to each other. No eye contact with us as customers. I was a bit put off, but the coffee is decent. 

They do offer a wide variety of items to add to your drink so that you can adapt it to your personal taste. 

We sat outside on the patio (my friend is a smoker) and the traffic wasn't overly loud. Not a bad spot to stop.I feel a little bad giving Chompie's a three-star review; really, they're more like a 3.25-star place, and I grade that mostly on the dry-ish omelet I had here. The service was pleasant and attentive, and I couldn't find anything else I was unhappy about; but my regular haunts back home turn a better omelet. Maybe it's just homesickness talking.How start a two week vacation.....
We found this place before the busy meat market packing.
A pitcher of margaritas and having Miss E spin the
Happy hour wheel. Somehow making sure it stopped on 
Patron shots.... down went four.
Nice beginning.We went because we had a Travel Zoo voucher. Not a bad deal but I think we ordered wrong.
The restaurant is very clean and I like the charming decor. Some might say it is kitschy but it is well done and pleasant to look at. The service is equally good. An overall nice experience.
The meal:
Warm bread with butter and oil -very good
Shrimp Caesar salad - tasty and extremely generous portion of grilled shrimp
Lamb chops - average but a very generous portion. The sauce was not necessary. 
Filet Mignon - worst steak ever. I really think it was a sirloin and not a filet. We each took one bite and then just left it. Didn't return it since we were using a coupon. Very low quality of beef. Probably should have ordered something other than steak.
Godiva chocolate mousse cake- above average but a little too sweet for my taste.I had a quick bite here while staying at Firesky this past weekend.

I sat outside and Will took care of me.  He had tables outside as well as the bar inside.

He was warm, friendly, and attentive.  Someone else (a managerial type) delivered my food which was ok.  I was hungry so I inhaled the Caprese sandwich with french fries.

The bread was a caramelized onion foccacia, with fresh mozzarella, bibb lettuce, and a slice of tomato with a pesto spread.

It was a basic sandwich and the fries were good and it served its purpose to fill me up before a night of boozing.

The rest of the options on the menu which boasts 'coastal Italian cuisine' seemed interesting but not much appealed to me...I was feeling like I wanted more meat free options though I am not a vegetarian.

Overall the food was average, what you would expect in a hotel but the service by Will was outstanding.  

He made sure to introduce himself ask my name and refer to me by that (as opposed to the general Miss, Ms. etc).  He was personable and surely is an asset to the Firesky staff at Taggia.The reason that it gets a 3, instead of a 4, was service. The food was a solid 4, with the pasta being cooked very well, the meatballs as big as your head and the pizza cooked just right! It was well priced for the quality. There is no kids menu, but if you can think of a pasta dish they can make up a half order for the tikes. Other than that, we just simply had lackluster service. Drink glasses routinely hitting and sitting on empty, only seeing the waiter once after food arrived, etc. There was a table next to us that seemed to get the VIP treatment and this place may be a 5-star experience if you are "that guy". Literally had management going over to the table and multiple waiters to greet "this guy". Well, I had never seen him before, and don't you go to places like this, and pay prices like this, so you get that same kind of service? Overall, it was a good restaurant and we would probably go and try it again. It is A-OK.Definitely an interesting store with very diverse merchandise ranging from home decor such as furniture and rugs to wine to random kitchen gadgets. I like the fact that a lot of this is made from around the world, so you can definitely find something unique. I will say I prefer shops where I know it is a fair trade store (I tried looking online to see if they were and I couldn't find that info so if I'm wrong, I'm sorry!). It was definitely a place I would go back to get a funky gift or to look for something different for house decor. But other than that, it was just ok.These mega corporate shopping places are not going away anytime soon. I would so much prefer to be walking along a "real" city scape or downtown, but I don't think it's gonna happen anytime soon for us Valley residents.   Whatever, this place is OK  every now and again I guess. I'll try not to patronize the crappy chain restaurants, I swear, just maybe the movies and buy some shoes or something.I'm going to start this off with the disclaimer that I'm not of the camp that believes that The Beatles are the greatest band to ever grace the face of the earth (The Ventures were doing FX work long before they were and their invasion of "Can't Buy Me Love" wiped out the rad age of surf rock. Origins of a concept album...okay I'll cede that to them, even though if you want to get technical about it every opera can be considered a concept album. But whatever.) What was I doing...oh yeah, writing a review. 

Being an avid Cirque-goer, I'm going to borrow from someone else's review to say that I was underwhelmed by the acrobatics. The sets and costumes were cool as always, although sometimes very cluttered and confused-looking. But there were very few noteworthy acts--the only two I remembered liking were the guys on skates and the dude trampolining around (I think during USSR?). And I was pissed at the lameness of "Come Together." If you are traversing long stretches of stage on foot in a Cirque show, you damn well had better be doing it via flips or cartwheels. DAFUQ? The choreography was meh. If they're going in the hip-hop direction they need to amp up their routines. Where's Mia Michaels when you need her?

It helps if you go into this without thinking of it as a cirque show, and instead as a multi-sensory Beatles concert sans the Fab Four. It's not like it was awful, but I left thinking I could've been at a Mystere show (two for the price of Love). My mom (the Beatles fan in the family) wasn't too impressed either (then again, she's not impressed by a lot of things...). 

I will give them credit though: I found out I don't dislike the Beatles as much as I do. And the dancified remixes of some of the songs sound pretty awesome (Glass Onion comes to mind).

PS: LOVE THAT RAINBOW WALKWAY!Went to this location to meet a colleague for a drink.  Had their Hefeweizen.....it was good.  Not the best I've ever had.  i would say this review is incomplete because I only had a drink at the bar.  The staff was pretty friendly, but I didn't have anything to eat and we only hung out at the bar.  I will visit this location again in the future and provide a more detailed review.Planet Hollywood---yes, that's the hotel where they have scantily clad girls dancing right behind you as you're playing blackjack. Me and my girlfriend had a coupon from restaurant.com to buy a drink and get one free (thereby making each drink cost as much as it would have at any swanky bar in a city like Cincinnatti or Buffalo), so we stopped by. I remember spending time in this lounge with a few friends years ago when I first came to Vegas. At night it has the reputation for being the site of prostitutes looking for business but during the day its generally deserted. Expect to pay premium prices for sitting in a reserved area.Tallest building on the Strip and a pretty killer view. 

The 360 degree view of the strip and downtown was beautiful, but with my fear of heights, was terrifying to say the least. When we went, it wasn't too crowded. We got to enjoy the observation deck as well as watch the rides from outside. I was in awe of everyone going on the rides; I definitely would not be able to make it on any of those. 

If you're staying at the hotel, you can get up there for free. We booked a hotel on Hotwire and paid around $86 for one night (would have been $56 if we didn't do late checkout) and 3 of us got to go up for free ($54 value). 

I personally don't think I'd ever pay $18 just to go up and not go on any rides. If I ever overcome my fear of heights, I'll run back to the Stratosphere, where they will hopefully accept me with open arms. In the meanwhile, it's one of those, "you've seen it once, you've seen it all" places.Def one of the better Robertos. Carne asada fries!Some like it hot...
Not the best Mexican food that I've had, but I would definitely keep this one on my list.  The menu is very affordable and the food is wicked spicy, both of which I love.  I had the fish taco on  my last visit and loved their seemingly home made tortilla.  The chips and salsa that are placed on the table to begin with are not the best.  The chips could use more salt and the salsa could use a couple variations besides red/green.  Keep in mind...low price point so I'm not too judgmental.It a good hotel but the free breakfast on 23 sucks and roomservice blows they barely clean the room and the pool is pretty small for a big hotel rather stay at WynnLocation: Phoenix, AZ

Parking: Not an issue at all since I walked here from my hotel, but there's a massive parking lot with many available spaces.

Ambiance: The ambiance and decor immediately transport you to the bayou, although I have never been to the bayou and only know it from what I've seen in the media.  Went twice during my stay in Phoenix.  Once during dinner and also a to-go order for lunch.  During dinner, it was very dim and some would say too dim to even see what you are eating.  Very loud so you can forget about having a nice, tranquil conversation with whomever you are dining alongside.

Service: DINNER - service was ok.  I got really irked when I asked for recommendations from our waiter.  Their menu is massive and I had a hard time deciding what to get.  I asked for some recommendations and the waiter immediately blurted out the most expensive thing on the menu and nothing else.  Hmm so just one recommendation...do you really think that's good, or are you just fishing for a bigger bill which will lead to a bigger tip?  Water refills were on time, and the wait staff was for the most part attentive, so the recommendation thing was the only major downfall.
LUNCH - Called in my order and said it would be ready in 10-15 min.  Walked over from my hotel (about a 10-15 min walk) and went inside.  Hostess pointed me to the to-go pick-up area.  Went over and waited for another 5 min before being attended to.  Paid for my order and waited another 5 min before receiving my food.  Waited a total of 20-25 min for my food.  Not that big of a deal, but they should know this for future reference.

Food: DINNER - After receiving a short-ended recommendation, I had to look over the menu a little bit more so my table mates placed their orders first.  I ended up getting the Crawfish Etoufee.  The dish was filled with crawfish.  Everything tasted fine except the white rice.  I'm Filipino so I've had my fair share of rice in my lifetime.  This rice tasted like minute rice.  That might fly in Phoenix, but in my world I expect something a little better.  At least the rest of the dish kinda sorta made up for it.  Portions are huge!  Everyone at my table had leftovers.  I would've had leftovers too but I was pretty hungry and ended up leaving super stuffed!
LUNCH - I ordered the "Louisiana" Seafood Gumbo & Shrimp Po Boy.  Now this was good!  Gumbo had a bounty of different seafood and tasted awesome.  The po boy had plenty of fried shrimp.  The bread on the po boy could have been better.  When I dipped the po boy into the gumbo MAN OH MAN was that BANGIN!!  Here's a tip for a new menu item: instead of a "French Dip," how bout a 'FRENCH QUARTER' DIP = Shrimp Po Boy + ("Louisiana" Seafood Gumbo - white rice).  Dip the po boy in the gumbo and as Chef Emeril Lagasse would say BAM!!!

Overall: 3.5 STARS this place is A-OK.  It is a bit overpriced.  If it weren't for the great lunch I had, I probably would have given it a lower rating.  Get the GUMBO and PO BOY and you won't be disappointed.So I kept driving by his place a bunch of times so I figured I would give it a try . I pulled up and noticed this is a large ass reasuraunt good thing I went on a monday night, I got seated quickly and got a menu in hand. Getting ready to order will review shortly....
Started out w lobster bisque which was good there was enough lobster chunks to make it worth while to eat

For main course I got house salmon , portion was large and the shrimp was a nice touch they added to the dish

Overall nice seafood place to take a date to and plenty of things to choose fromProduce was not fresh, gnats... I hate gnats in a grocery store.

They had some of what I was looking for, they do have a rewards card and gas saving offers, they do have self checkout, but really... it was like shopping at Walmart. I just moved, so perhaps i'll give the Anthem store a try.Have to say I'm slightly disappointed. The Nutella crepe was just ok, too much sugar. The brioche was good. The almond croissant was ok. Overall, I actually much prefer bakeries I've had in Santa Barbara. A disappointment, and not worth it's own trek down the strip to get here.Not a bad place overall.  No cover, nice setup, and not too crowded.

Eyecandy sits right in the middle of the casino and can best be thought of as two different places occupying adjacent spaces.  In one space, there is a simple lounge with plenty of good seating and a decent bar, pretty regular stuff.  In the other space is what appears to be a mini-club, although it was among one of the oddest dance spaces I've seen in Vegas.  For one, I was told (though I didn't actually see this) that there are sound booths where you can plug in your iPod and send music directly to the DJ.  That's pretty much where the good stuff ends.  I am told that the crowd seriously varies, so we must not have come on a good night (but seriously, we came on a Friday night, so if not then, then when?).  There is apparently absolutely no dress code whatsoever, and that's really a shame, because as a result of this, there were plenty of guys in shorts and sandals (with the obligatory women stuffed into cocktail dresses two sizes too small).  I'm usually one for relaxing dress codes all across the board, but I think Eyecandy took it a bit far.

Again, I've heard that experiences vary drastically depending on what night you happen to be coming by and that there really is no way to predict what experience you're going to get because there's no discernible pattern at this place.  I can at least say with some certainty that the lounge area will likely remain consistent, and for this place, that's a good thing.Very disappointed in the new menu. The prices also got more expensive. Almost makes me not want to return because they got rid of my favorite menu item. However, great service and food quality as always :) The buffalo wings are a must every visit!Pros:
Beer
Atmosphere 
Location 
Layout 
Indoor outdoor
Decent service 

Cons:
Food is just sub par
-Was super excited to try the SanTan Bloody but was disappointed in the execution of what sounded like a tasty  beverage
-ordered the "From the Smoker". Brisket was beyond Fatty everything else was just ok

Also side note: Patio is not dog friendlyFood's ok, love the drinks though. It's more of a sports bar feel.5 stars for the hot Ginger Chai latte. It serves a sore throat well. Kudos to the chicken soup, too. It was delicious. Mmm Mmm good.

Super yuck for the side of veggies that was cold and tasted charred. I took one bit and about gagged. 

There's plenty of parking behind the place, too, which is a plus when you're trying to beat or compete with the lunch rush. You'll have to walk through the smell of frying fries, thanks to the fast food joint nearby.

There wasn't much of a rush when my friend, Kym, and I went around noon, though. It picked up after a bit, though. 

There's not much atmosphere here. The menu offers salads and wraps, along with coffee and tea. It's a cool spot to check out once. Would I go back? Hrm. Yes, but only for that ginger chai latte. I will definitely be craving that in the future.If I had written a review for this place late last year, I would have given it one star. I first tried Fuji Buffet last summer and the food was good enough to make me return quite frequently at first. But as the months went by the quality of the food declined. It seemed that they were trying to cut a lot of corners, which was not surprising after the crash of the economy. But the food quality became so bad that I decided not to return.

Early this year I saw signs announcing the "rebirth" of the establishment, but after my dining experiences late last year I wasn't in a hurry to try its new incarnation. Yesterday I finally decided to give it another try. The price hasn't changed, and the food ... well, some dishes were good (I especially liked the seafood delight) and the sushi array was decent. Some of the other dishes were just OK and a few were subpar. No oysters during this trip - I was hoping for those, as I've had them here during my visits last year; but maybe I should return on a weekend and see if they have it. I really want to give the establishment 2 and a half stars, but I guess 3 stars will have to do at this time. That may change in either direction when I update this review in the future. Yes, I intend to come back though I'm not in a hurry to do so.Il give three star! Definitely coming back here... $21.95 buffet sushi and etc..staff friendly great food...Food was ok. Price was pretty reasonable. Spend some more somewhere else for a better meal.The Cathouse sucks the big one if you are looking to dine there.   4 star prices with cafe-level food.   I foolish paid $22 for a $6 spaghetti dinner there.   My buddy foolish spend $23 for a $7 dollar burger

The lounge area is pretty cool to chill in.   Drinks are on the pricey side.   

There's a reason why you will be accosted inside the casino by a Luxor employee giving out free passes to the CathouseCathouse was decent I went here with my girls late one night, probably on a Sat night, we got in free had a few drinks and danced till they stopped playing good music then it was time to go. It's not very big, but it's not crowded like the usual clubs. I would go back again. :)The line situation was crazy.  Unfortunately for about a dozen people or so, a girl happened to drunk way to much and threw up a cornucopia of goodies.  Ceviche anyone?

Luckily for me, I had VIP so that meant only a 10 minute wait in line as opposed to 30 minutes.  The escalator ride up is a great photo op for those that are into that sort of thing.

The club itself is on the smallish side.  But VIP sections are located throughout.  We sat next to Lil' Jon, who had one of the largest bodyguards I've ever seen.  The guy was a walking bungalow.  

I had a great time.  Business was conducted freely and several transactions took place.  It was fun.  I would go again, but through VIP only.  The general admission is bananas!

Yeeee--aaaaahhhhh....I ordered take-out from Thai Elephant tonight and I was thoroughly impressed with a number of aspects:

1.  They were open late on a weeknight, particularly a MONDAY, when 98% of downtown looks like 'I Am Legend'.

2.  Portions are generous.  I ordered Pad Thai for dinner that will persevere to be my lunch for tomorrow.  An order of egg rolls comes in fives.

3.  Prices are reasonable.  I was expecting elevated prices to coincide with downtown rent and Monday convenience.  Chicken Pad Thai was $11 and the egg rolls $5.  Not bad considering that translates to two meals.

4.  Use of space is charming.  Classier than an upscale dive like like House of Nanking, but you can wear flip-flops there.  Looks and feels very Feng Shui'd out, dressed in red and walnut.  

5.  Location is perfect, not only for my situation, but for other downtown denizens.  Its pretty much at Phoenix's 0,0, where all addresses radiate outward unto the gaping depths of the Valley starting from there. 

6.  Most importantly, the food was delicious.  The noodles were moist and heavy while the chicken was light and tender.  I ordered 'medium' spice, but after the dish I was wanting more of a burn.  There was also a shortage of scallions in the dish.  I downed the few present in two small bites.  The veggie egg rolls were tasty, crunchy, and flaky -- almost like a fried spring roll.  I was impressed by the use of pumpkin inside.  The accompanying sweet and sour sauce was much milder that what you typically get beside an eggroll and was a nice pairing.  

I cannot think of a reason not to go if you are in the area.Cool, hipster vibe. I really like the feel of the place, with recycled artwork and interesting, comfortable seating areas. The baristas were hipster as well, but were very friendly. Coffee was ready fast considering there was a line. I just got an Americano, which was decent - kind of strong for me, but I didn't want to use syrup as a sweetener. Anyway, I want to try other things, like the toddy. The rest of the menu doesn't seem very fancy, just the basics. It's nothing too elaborate, but I can't complain.I recently visited Phoenix for the first time, and the one thing I was really excited for was to try my first In-N-Out burger.

I've heard things.  I've seen the "secret" menu.  I've thought about what I would order.

What I did end up ordering (and eating poolside) was a double-double, animal style, with fries and a strawberry shake.

Was it messy?  Yes.
Were the fries outstanding?  No, they were just A-OK
Was the shake the best ever?  No, in my opinion, Portillo's has a better strawberry shake.  A-OK

But the burger?  That burger.  That mustard cooked patty, dripping in all of its animal style glory... That I'd go back for time and time again.I had a really tasty sandwich here, the Smokehouse Beef & Cheddar here. But I will agree with other reviewers that the sandwich could stand to be a bit bigger for the price. I liked the fact that if you accept all defaults (they ask you every step of the process how you would like your sandwich), this BBQ-sauce filled sandwich also gets mayonaisse. Most people may not like that, but I do. The combination of sweet-tangy and creamy works for my palette.

Didn't sample the impressive array of hot sauces available for spicing up one's sandwich, but always happy to see a wide selection of condiments available. 

I'm tempted to come back here and try their other selections. I also liked how you can buy the house BBQ sauce in a fire-hydrant shaped bottle.Somewhere between three and four stars on this one. I came here as part of a bachelor party celebration, so there were eight of us. We wanted somewhere nice but not exorbitant, and this place seemed like a good fit.

I think all of us enjoyed our food, but none of us were blown away. I had the chicken, which was well-seasoned but a tiny bit on the dry side. Also ordered were the seafood stew (not as spicy as advertised), the salmon special, and the main pork entree (something stuffed with something else, if I remember correctly). We had a vegan in the group and the kitchen did their best to accommodate him with some fresh vegetable sides. The portions were all appropriate but not cartoonish--just the right amount, I'd say. We also all ordered salads. I ordered the spinach and goat cheese salad, which was very tasty. I especially loved the crostini that came with it--I wanted about 10 more of those. I also tried a bite of the beet salad, which was good.

The wine selection is excellent, and the wines by the glass are reasonable (10-14 or so). I had a delightful sauvignon blanc--really one of the better glasses of wine I've had in a restaurant.  I think everyone at our table had either wine or beer (they have an OK beer selection, but nothing fancy, and only bottles).

No desserts, so I can't comment on that.

The ambience is lovely, though I was surprised that there was no music playing. Eerily quiet. It also wasn't particularly crowded, and we were there on a Saturday between about 6 and 8.

The service was inconsistent--fast in the beginning, then slow before the entrees, and then slow again to pick up the check. 

The whole thing came to something like $450 including tax and tip, which I viewed as pretty good for Vegas. Still, I'd try another place before I'd go back.This is more of a bar set up than a restauraunt. There are only about 7-8 tables where you can sit down and have a meal, and they are very cramped. The food however was very good, and so were the drinks. Go for happy hour as the small plates and drinks are half price 4-7 PM everyday. Service was above average and I would go back for sure. Wasn't there for the late night crowd but if you like Karaoke this is the place for you.I do eat here relatively often because my sister is a big fan but me eh not so much. It's OK like nothing fantastic, nothing terrible but when people say "How about Geisha?" My usual reaction is "Yeah that's fine" but what I'm really thinking is the following review: 

They have some inventive rolls but they are largely deep fried which I'm not a big fan of. Maybe I'm just being a snob (I am kind of a snob; full disclosure) but I feel like it's a little run down and old. It doesn't smell musty but it's one of those places that look like it could. Also, it's not like it's cheap; usually you'll spend about $40 bucks for two people I mean that's not a lot by old town standards but considering the sushi is ho hum and it feels a little old and like it hasn't been renovated in awhile I personally don't think it's worth it. When I go out to eat in Old Town I expect nice decor and delicious and this place just doesn't do it for me.I am really stuck in the middle here with Codfathers.  Part of me loves this place.  They have football on the telly, marmite, and tons of good beers.  The other part of me hates it because of the greasy food and the STRANGE clam chowder.  I just don't know what to do.

I order the mahi and chips.  The fries were really boring and cold.  The fish was decent but really wasn't cooked all the way through.  I also ordered a bowl of clam chowder.  I was expecting something like Ivars and got some runny cioppino-like stew.  It was really bad until I salted the hell out of it.  Then, it got strangely addictive and I couldn't stop eating it.  

Really weird.  I'd like to come back here but I don't think it's going to happen.  I'm sure my wife hated it.I needed to get something quick and easy and this was the place located in the food court area of the Venetian and Palazzo, I got the Sam and Emma's sandwitch. Three slice's of wheat bread (my choice) with Turkey, Roast Beef, and Pastromi! Yumm very good! oh and CAUTION soup is extremly hot so be careful!Been here a couple times for the crawfish etouffee. It's pretty good but certainly not the best. This place is worth the stop if you have to have some cajun food but it's certainly nothing to rave about. There's just not enough cajun options in Chandler/Gilbert. I will go back soon to try the po'boys and frog legs and update how those are.So now that I've been to Stacy's a few times, thought I'd review it. All in all, it's a great place. Seems to me a little on the pricey side BUT you also get a decent amount of food so it's a wash!!! Their BBQ items are wonderful and the barbecue sauce is out of this world! I was slightly disappointed on my last visit though. I decided to try the fish and all I can say is it IS a barbecue joint!! It was a bit over cooked and they were out of tarter sauce which is a huge bummer is you're ordering a fish & chips type deal and they were out. The girl behind the count was more than apologetic and offered me ranch instead, which much to my surprise, was alright! I will still HAPPILY continue to go to Stacy's keeping in mind to order the barbecue stuff! I was told the catfish was outstanding though!I saw many 4&5 star reviews so I was anxious to try this place. I found the service here good and the place clean, but the food was just ok. It wasn't of the quality where I would have to have it again. The pork in my lunch was tasty but very dry. The spring rolls were nothing special. My vermicelli and veggies were once again, average. I really expected something better based on other people's reviews.I have been here several times and I have mixed reviews about this place. There are times when I have been here where the food and the service is just not up to par and the last time I was here, was not any different. 
   I brought my sister here for her birthday dinner. We decided to sit outside since they had the misters outside turned on to cool things down a bit. We didn't order any appetizers but we decided to get drinks. The peach and raspberry sangria with moscato in it not only looked good but it was very refreshing. My sister ordered the shrimp risotto and I ordered the angel hair pasta with pesto sauce and shrimp. The risotto dish seemed fine, each dish had jumbo shrimp in it but my pasta was dry and had little to no sauce on it.  
   In the middle of our dinner, the restaurant decided to turn the misters off, even though it was only 7:30. At that point, it just got too hot and uncomfortable to even enjoy our meal. We were just ready to go but our waiter seemed really busy so we just sat out there in heat waiting for him to come by with our check. 
    May be next time I come here, I will sit inside so I am not melting in the heat and can try to enjoy my meal.Visit on 1/21/12

Normally I experience a 4 at The Yard House but this experience was a 2 at best...I'm giving them a 3 for benefit of the doubt.  Service was s  l  oooooooooow... It was semi-busy but we have been there at busier times.  We started with the onion rings-tasty as usual.  My husband ordered the grilled pastrami which he said was very good.  I had the Thai chicken Noodle salad.  There was a generous serving of perfectly grilled chicken strips on the salad.  The noodles were slightly tough but otherwise a tasty dish.

The music was extremely loud during our visit.  We gave up on talking.  Getting our check took at least 10 minutes until my husband had to ask another passing waiter.Billed as the only Burmese restaurant in Scottsdale, a claim I doubt is heavily disputed, Little Rangoon has to cater its menu to a wider audience. Though there are a few native Burmese dishes, many of the dishes were common Thai plates. Although I guess most specialized restaurants in cuisines like Burmese have to throw a wider net to catch more customers, I like to restaurants stick more to their native specialties. 

I did have the si gyet kauswer (garlic noodles), which is heavily Chinese inspired, but still unique enough not to be readily available at other types of restaurants. The soft egg(?) noodles were delicious, but the duck was barely present. I did enjoy the sweet sauce accompanying the noodles as well.

I'll have to come back some time and order family-style so I can try more variety. I'll also be sure to try the curries, which are supposedly a cross between Indian and Thai curries.The atmosphere and sunny disposition of the staff are standouts at this giant, east coast vibe Pizzeria... I had the Straight Flush Hoagie, and Tossed Salad with Italian Meats.. The sandwich was HUGE.. Well. Ok the BREAD was huge.. The contents of the sandwich were tasty, as I'm crazy for Italian deli meats, but decidedly skimpy, and it begged for some veggie additions.. It was kind of a dry experience.. The bread was REALLY good though.. The salad could have used some work, as there wasn't much to it. It was a very fresh mix of lettuce, and a very light sprinkling of Mozzarella, and a few other things.. Neither were really a home run, but they weren't horrible either.  Another issue was that I placed the order to go, and was told 30 minutes... I arrived a bit early, and checked my phone to see when I placed the order.. ultimately it took 40 minutes. I'm not one to typically complain about time, nor did the employees seem inefficient, but I think having more than 2 people working may help expedite things a bit faster. Again, the friendliness and atmosphere are great here, and I think it would be a great place to pop in and grab a big slice of pizza if you're in Downtown Mesa..Rounding out my three night kobe adventure was sushi samba.  This place was pretty darn cool. I give them 4 stars for the kobe and 3 for the rest.  The sushi was very good, but not "las vegas" good.  There are far better places if you just want sushi.  But this place is different, offering a spin of Brazillian flare on the Japanese standard.  I liked the playfulness.... 

but back to the important stuff... the Kobe!  Grade A5 from Japan (I'm guessing Vegas had a shipment of this because every place said they had A5 Japanese Kobe!)  Sushi Samba brought out a plate of raw sliced kobe next to a line of dry and wet spices/marinades.  Then came the huge hot rock.  We were then instructed to dip the beef in the marinade of choice, set on rock for 30 seconds a side, then sprinkle with preferred dry spice.  I watched the ladies at our table go first and I saw them immediately go to their "happy place" with the first bite.  After the rest of the table ate, I could see everyone counting the remaining pieces to see how many more bites they had.  Hahahaha!!! So much fun!

Great Sake list if you like that (which I do).  Hundreds of junmai daiginjo bottles going into the $1,000's.  I found a decent one for $50 (300ml).  So recap, get the kobe, enjoy the sushi... don't go if sushi is all that you want, there's better.My boyfriend and I stopped by right before Frightdome 2012.

The decor is REALLY cheezy but kind of fits in with the circus circus decor. I got medium buffalo wings and my boyfriend got the sausage pepper sandwich.
my boyfriend said the sandwich was really good. as for me, I found the wings ot be A OK. they were freshly cooked, they were cooked all the way though and really moist, but the 'medium' tasted like 'mild' and didn't impress me. Service was fast and good, but I was hoping to see a smile on the waitresses faces. I figured it was because it was a Saturday during Frightdome; It gets crazy during the month of October.I'll start of by saying that it's not a true free fall, it's pretty controlled and you're well harnessed in, so no one need fear for their life.  The harness is pretty snug and is checked multiple times by different staff members to ensure safety.  The view of the strip from the platform you jump off of is spectacular and I suggest jumping at night just for the view.  Overall I wouldn't say that it's really worth the cost if you're into any sort of thrill activities, but I'm sure that it's terrifying and worth it for some.  Be sure to let the cashier know if you are military and you will receive a pretty good discount.i think its ridiculous that you don't allow dogs!Formerly Shintaro at Bellagio, Yellowtail is the Bellagio's attempt to cater to the younger hip crowd. The decor and ambiance are nice. The bar setup is cool. A few more specific comments

- on a busy night they do not give beepers or have any way of tracking you when your table is ready. So keep a watchful eye or they could skip you!
- drinks at the bar are about $14 for cocktails (the kiwi one is tasty), to $12 for large Asahi. Reasonable for Vegas, but still on the high end.
- Sushi rolls are pretty tasty, but be forewarned that they are SMALL. They roll them tight with not much rice. Not too much inside either. So while you may think a roll for $9 isn't that bad, you only get a small portion. So you must end up ordering more than you thought just to not be hungry an hour later.
- Bill for my wife and I. We each ordered 2 rolls, plus some sashimi. 2 cocktails and one large beer, with tip came to $150. Luckily we charged it to our MGM room which has a 30% off promotion via Mastercard until January 31, 2009 - otherwise it was a complete rip.

Food good
Ambiance good
Service acceptable
Price excessive

Simply for better and larger sushi (and cheaper), I suggest the sushi bar inside Caesar's Palace (next to Cleopatra's Barge).Bar Louie is a go-to for us when we go to West Gate. When other places are over run we can usually grab a seat outside, munch on some pretzels, and wait for the rest of our group to arrive. The patio allows for an enjoyable people watching experience especially since it is right across from the arena. 

The service is OK, drink orders are slow it seems, but it serves its purpose.Gyros sandwich was good with fresh and soft bread, although I've had larger portions of meat at other places for less money. I've had better fry's baked in my oven from the freezer section of the grocery store.  As a previous poster mentioned. Employees were quick to disappear as soon as you're served and there is no one else to help.Dear Sarah G,

Thank you for the suggesting we go to Paradise cafe. I tried the cookies and they were A-OK. Perhaps it is time to return for a 6th try?

Sincerely,

Jenn H

Now back to my regularly scheduled review of Paradise Bakery:

First of all... WHY THE CRAP WAS IT SO COLD IN THERE? Even my poor little Yelp hoodie couldn't keep me warm. I ordered soup - SOUP in July! - to keep me warm and that did not work. Perhaps that is because the soup was made out of a melted salt lick. 

But that's another issue.
 
Oh...

My salad was dope 

They have Fresca in the soda fountain (Yes!)

They gave me a free cookie

3 different types of iced tea 

The bathroom was very clean 

Free internet rocks 

But if you intend to eat here bring a snow suit. 

Or possibly a snow suit, pile of blankets, ear muffs and a space heater.

Brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr. Still shivering.I chose this place for lunch on a recent trip to Kierland being that I scored a parking spot right in front! WooHoo!

First of all they had a VERY unprofessional and inexperienced snot-nosed (literally) Hostess working that day.

We almost decided not to stay because of the way we were treated
( spoken to demeaningly, rude, abrupt and carelessly seated) by the Hostess.   
The manager happened to notice our distress and promptly moved us inside to a table that accommodated our party size, Unfortunately we were not offered anything complimentary for our trouble :(

We got  a Great Waiter!  
Ice Tea is Delicious,Refreshing and never got empty, the fresh baked bread and roasted red pepper whipped butter was out of this world!

We started with the Fresh Mozzarella,Local Tomato, Sweet Basil and Aged balsamic salad caprese style......DELICIOUS!

I ordered the Flattened chicken sandwich with saute' spinach and smoked provolone on  a fresh baked ciabatta bagel bun...YUM
my only complaint is that the chicken had too much a of a bitter charred flavor. 
Choice of side was pasta salad or veggies, I chose the pasta salad and was disappointed in it's flavorless mayo like coating.

2 of my Guests ordered the Angus burger with fresh mozzarella and crisp pancetta, both said it was scrumptious.

1 guest ordered the "Not Your Typical" chicken lasagna.....
This meal was Sad, Lasagna should have never been in the same sentence, it was a bowl of stir-fried chicken ,spinach, mushrooms and broth covered with a big square noodle.
Should have been called "Not your Typical" chicken soup.

It tasted OK (i tried it) but OH so NOT what we were expecting I wouldn't recommend it.

I noticed the table next to me ordered another pasta dish that was the exact same ingredients as our faux lasagna except it had corkscrew noodles mixed through out.....that's lame......2 of the same dishes labeled differently.

Tiramisu for dessert was spot on! Very light and creamy!Pretty neat place. The tour is free and us self guided; you walk about 150 yards along the production line; when we went they were producing a small batch for Valentine's Day. It's pretty neat and takes about 5 minutes; the tour ends  with a small free sample and entry to their chocolate shop, where we were blown away by their prices... In a bad way... $48 boxes of chocolates and $35 boxes of pecan brittle... 

The cactus garden was very neat as well. This is a good stop on your way back to Vegas from the Hoover Dam.This place is fun because of the conveyor belts... but it sucks when you have to wait an eternity to get seats. If you can call ahead then do so! The good thing about it being busy is fresh sushi but the downside is waiting forever to get those rolls. If you can't find what you want you can always order it which is nice. I think the prices are decent, most plates are $1.5-$2 for 4 pieces of sushi. Do not go there on a Sunday night... I feel like that is when the sushi looks like it has been sitting out for awhile. I won't say it is the greatest sushi but for the price it is just fine. I do love the "harupoppers" though but I'm not sure if those count as sushi.I've eaten here many times, although I have to say the food is just average.  Table service for the buffet is always excellent, however.

Buffet has a variety of Chinese dishes, salad bar, peel & eat shrimp, crab legs, sushi, and even pizza to name a few.  Dinner is $11.99 and lunch is $7.99 if I remember correctly.

Again, food is nothing to rave about but okay if you're in the neighborhood.  Word of caution, I noticed last night the shrimp is not deveined.  YUCK, YUCK, YUCK.  It didn't seem to bother my husband.  What a surprise.So much for making a resolution to eat out less, it's not really working!

Had lunch at Cafe Bink today, food was very good and service was very attentive.It is pricey though...With tip  came out of there at $ 26. I had the French Onion soup and the chicken sandwich. The only thing  did not care for was that the chicken in the sandwich was cubed rather than served as a chicken breast. don't know why they do that...maybe makes the chicken more tender..?

I am only giving three stars as  feel the prices are a little too steep.Duke's is my place to grab some lunch when I want to get away from the same old grind of a sandwich. The food is okay and has always been fresh when I have eaten here with co-workers. The hot wings, burgers, sandwiches, and salads are all pretty good!  It is a sports bar so if you are wanting to do an intimate lunch or want to speak without having to raise your voice a bit. This would not be the place for you. If you are a sports junkie than this is the perfect place for you to come and relax and watch various sports on there 15+ televisions and have a cold beer.Salmon burger? Yum. Falafel burger? Disappointed. A little on the dry side. Fries? Yum again. Moz sticks? Love them.my trip to vegas was a slew of different burgers. 

came here after having visited i love burgers at the palazzo. 

blt burger is alright in my book. the menu seemed to have some appealing options, but none i could decide on. i debated between the lamb burger and falafel burger. the lamb burger came with olives and cucumbers, and not being a fan of either, decided i should just go for the falafel. 

not to mention our waitress was pretty unhelpful at making suggestions. when both me and my friend asked her for her recommendation she would just say, "it just depends on what you like!" well, of course it does, i guess, but we're asking for at least a half-assed fake, "most people order this" at the very least. meh. 

the falafel burger, sure enough came with a very large falafel patty which i couldn't finish at all. it is HELLA falafel, is all i'm saying. it's a good falafel, but LOTS of falafel. almost an overdose of falafel. i enjoyed it, but wished the patty might have been thinner or something... hm. perhaps that's just me.

also ordered the sweet potato fries, which were as good as any sweet potato fries in my book. if i were to go back in time i might want to try the waffle fries, just because i haven't had waffle fries in a long time. 

blt burger was fine. i don't think it's a must-have in vegas, but if in a crunch or if in the mirage then it's also not a bad option.I went there with my father after a show in Vegas, i wanted him to try a nice burger, i had a chix burger w avocado and pesto pretty good flavor,our sever could not explain us more about the meat they use or the difference between them  so my dad just got a classic... it was ok. probably be backThe burgers were okay. They were a little bit on the drier side. The burgers are a pretty good size. You can get a burger combo, with a side and alcoholic shake.  The shake was pretty good.  

All in all, the burger isn't anything crazy special, there are better burger places on the strip.I don't think I've been to a larger gym ever. This place is HUGE!!!!

Interesting observation though, in my two visits to the upper floor cardio and weight room area, I didn't see a single employee cleaning. I also didn't see any trainers either.

The place looks a little dated but is a great facility.Came here armed with a freebie for a free gyro, I am there, tried it out and have to say the gyro was small and salty,dry too,, but service was great,, but probably will not go back, sorry , just cannot take too much salt in my food...As far as theaters go in this area, I know I don't want to go to Metro Center.Jet is only open on Friday, Saturday and Monday. 
  It's an unusual setup appearing to be designed to serve as much alcohol as possible.  The main area is a huge rectangle with the bars extending from front to back along both sides.  The bottle service tables are in the the middle section on both ends with the dance area in the middle of the middle section.   Did you get that?   There is a back room with another bar and small dance floor with more bottle service tables.  It might be easier to get a drink back here. 
 On Monday, Industry Night, it's just too damn crowded.   There's not too much happening on Monday's but it's just too crazy here.I didn't even make it inside.....check it! Waiting in line for an hour. We met some people from Cali and they told us this is going to be the best night we had in vegas club.  So I am ready right???? Wrong! Got to the door and the bouncer told me I needed to change me shoes before I got in.  Cold Blooded ( Rick James) !Got in for free on a Saturday night because someone was giving out passes out on the strip earlier in the day. I was trying to find someone with XS passes because I kept hearing that it was the best place to go. But hey- no waiting in line and no entrance fee? Jet it is.

Got there at midnight- There was a crowd waiting to get in and you could feel the vibe of the place right away. Walking in, already the decor was super fun- kind of like a cave lite with candles. Yes the dance floor is small- you're basically looking for a spot inbetween bottle service tables along the edges and the pole dancing high rise in the middle. I wouldn't call it a dance floor- I'd call it a dance border. Also the drinks are expensive, and they don't give you tap water- had to pay 6 bucks for a tiny bottle of fiji.

That being said- we still had a great time! The music was great if you're into mainstream hip hop, they played some poppy stuff like beyonce and gaga too. The crowed was a mix of different types of people of all races, which I like. It was a constant party all night long. The guys don't leave you alone if you say go away like they do in LA, so we had to keep scurrying around the "dance border" to find a new spot, but majority of the time we were dancing the night away. Left at 3am, but coulda finished up to closing at 4 if we really wanted to. 

3 stars for a mix of good and bad
-if it's more than 10$ to get in probably go somewhere else, but ladies try getting in for free!
-Danceable hip hop mainstream music
-pricey drinks
-small dance floor
-good saturday crowd

I'm happy we went here instead of XS or Tao. I didn't feel like waiting in a long line and paying 20$ for house music and too many people. Would definitely go back to Jet!I stayed at this place while attending a conference. The location is very good just off Hwy 8. Ample parking space. The check-in process was really efficient. I was offered an upgrade although I am not a very frequent user of their program. Complimentary aps coupon as well! I was happy that they offered an eco program which is linen change by request or every other day . The front desk also offered various dining options in the area and actually suggested a spot to move my car in the parking lot as it would be closer to my room! The reason; the hotel is sprawling! It's good exercise to walk to your room. The room was neat and tidy. They have a pretty decent bar and The breakfast was good too. I am very impressed with the Holiday Inn. They are very comparable to the Marriott courtyards. Impressive for a budget hotel. Good job people!Located in the Super Target shopping area at the SW intersection of the 101 and I-17.  Wildflower serves up amazing breakfasts that you order at the counter.  It's full service food without the tips!  Soups are great at lunch, and don't forget to take home a loaf of bread.  Prices are very reasonable, and parking isn't an issue.  

Luna Pizza a few doors down can be tempting competition though!Like any other High End outlet stores you have to have luck on your side.
The basics, very basic you can get for a good deal.
Socks, undies, bikinis, an occasional polo can all be bought for under $60 (each mind you)
Descent but not a steal.
I have had the pleasure of buying some bad ass heels (studded black shiny leather) for $80 instead of over $1000 (last pair, no box)
Other than that, always worth a look, but without too much excitement.
Service is fine, not great, its fuller than it needs to be in here and the big items like purses and trenchcoats still cost way too much.Nice Ambient, food very tasty but somehow we felt push by our server trying to pushes everything in the menu maybe he was trying to hard , price is little high for the value . I know they were extremely busy but we did wanted  to enjoy our meal everything was coming way to fast food not enough time to enjoy an expensive meal , plate were coming one behind the other super fast to fastThere are very few foods I crave as comfort food splurges more than Fried Chicken or Pizza.  I had been wanting fried chicken for a few days and Friday afternoon thru Saturday evening are my splurge days.  Wanting to try something new and different ( I usually end up at Churches) I turned to my trusty Yelp app.  

I hopped in my car and drove south to a shopping center on Baseline and 20th Street.  It is a small shop with just a few tables for dine-in.  One person was waiting ahead of me and as I placed my order, the fryer timer went off.  The guy who took my order then politely excused himself  and scrambled to the back kitchen area in response to the timer.   Poor guy was the only one here at the store today.  Forced to work the register and the fryers, but he was handling it well.  He was very polite and provided great service.  (4 Stars for service)

I ordered a 10 piece Shrimp and Fries and an 8 piece chicken (only chicken).    My order was prepared right then after ordering.  Makes all the difference in the world when it comes to fried foods.  Taking my order to go, I dug into the fries on the way home (you have to enjoy them while they are hot right?) They were awesome.  The shrimp were intermingled with the hot fries and both had been well seasoned with a spicy cajun salt.  Hot, salty (in a good way) and perfectly spicy.  Once home I enjoyed the shrimp with their spicy southern fried coating (not a thick dry breading).   I would absolutely go back just for the shrimp and fries.  As for the chicken it was just ok.  I didn't find it any better than fried chicken I can get at the grocery deli.  For me I still prefer Churches Chicken but wouldn't rule the chicken out here completely.  (3 Stars for the Chicken)

In the future I would love to try their chicken tenders or nuggets and will absolutely go back for the shrimp.I'm happy to say that after having successive bad experiences at Burrachos in Middleton the establishment has taken a turn for the better.  In addition to my review I sent in a comment via their website and received a apologetic response from the newly-appointed store manager.  He made several immediate changes which were apparent the next time I stopped by.  The staff were all friendly and the burrito was made properly.  I've returned several times since and have always had a decent experience.  I've tried several of the different burrito options and I've found that the carnitas pork is actually quite good, while I found the chicken to be a bit dry.  So I'm happy to say that this place has gotten better, and also that giving feedback can actually make a difference.  Who woulda thought?We stopped in on a Friday night. Ordered 2 chicken tacos and nachos to split. 
The chicken tacos are big and tasty, the only thing is the chicken doesn't seem to be seasoned at all. Plus it was a little dry.
The nachos were pretty good, again the chicken was flavorless and dry but the cheese made up for it, they were yummy.Went here for dinner with some girlfriends on Saturday night. It has a nice clean and trendy atmosphere with some tasty bite. It's a little pricy, as are most decent sushi restaurants. They cocktails are yummy, I had a refreshing St. Germaine, as well as some miso soup and veggie tempura. Good place for girls night, or dates. If you're a resident of Scottsdale, they are even featuring a locals discount until Labor Day... Thumbs up to that management!What recession? BLT was packed.. Dinner for 2, about 300 bucks! 

The steaks were just alright, I don't care for the fact that they burn the steaks at 1700 degree leaving the crust blackened and very bitter.. the sides were all very greasy.. the celery root gratin was swimming in oil.. the onion rings were so greasy they glistened in the well appointed lighting.. Gnocchi was stuck to the cast iron pan and literally fell apart when you trying pulling some out.. hen of the woods was unseasoned and very dry.

Desserts were dismal.. ordered Pumpkin Pie, Caramelized Cheesecake and Chocolate Torte.. the pumpkin pie could have been from anywhere, though Marie Calendar's makes a better pie. Caramelized cheesecake had crispy caramel on top that was so badly torched it was disgustingly bitter. Chocolate torte gave the cheesecake a run for its money, was covered in the most bitter chocolate powder ever, though after scraping it off it was just alright.

Highlights.. Tuna tartar was amazingly delicious.. Scallop was off the chart delicious.. chicken liver pate was great, some of the best Ive ever had! Popovers.. oh my gawd! The popovers were so good I could have stripped naked and made passionate love to it right there.. hmm, me having popover sex in public, well, maybe not! 

Anyway, if you dont want to spend big bucks on dinner stick with the seafood apps, share a steak and ask them not to burn it, skip the desserts and go to Ice Tango its only a few miles away. How's that for recession dining?I'm ok with this place. I've actually only gone here a couple times after the rebuild after the fire damage. The food is quite good ranging from average to above average. It's light years ahead of some of the guck I had earlier from Fuzzy's Taco Shop yet I can't say I'd drive here over similar neighborhood tastes like El Pastor or La Hacienda. The reason this place won't get stars higher with me is honestly trhe seating and noise. It feels like I'm in some kind of lunch room in High School all over again when there are more people there. Everyone seems friendly and the servers are friendly but its strange for me to have a meal with people at my elbows that I don't know. The other issue I've come across there is cleanliness ranging from strange things floating in the water to finding a rubber band in the salsa.. It looked like something to just tie jalapenos or tomatos-not a hair band..but still.. I'm sure curiosity will drive me back here again in the future or will venture into a delivery option sometime again.Okay, so after my last review I received a friendly reminder from the owner, Terry, that perhaps I was thinking of the America's Special for Two when I mentioned I can't justify spending $20 on carne asada tacos for two. No, I wasn't talking about that, but thank you for the heads up. I do understand that America's food is high in quality and especially tasty, and I appreciate that. I don't necessarily appreciate a "friendly reminder" from the owner wherein my review is casually mentioned as incorrect. I was simply stating my opinion.

Anyway, let it be known that I have returned twice since my initial review (which was written after several visits), upon the request of Terry. Both times were for breakfast burritos. The first time, we dined in. Actually, we sat on their new patio. The patio is spacious and has a nice little bar and more than several tables. It was a Sunday morning, and a little early, so we were the only ones dining outside. Now let me ask, what the hell was up with all of the flies?! There were literally hundreds of flies outside. On the tables, the bar, the chairs, EVERYWHERE. Like, what were they so attracted to? It didn't seem so bad at first, but as soon as we got our food we were swarmed. Our table was full with food, drinks and the like so instead of moving everything inside we just ate really quickly. An employee came out and asked how everything was, and was quick to apologize after we pointed out the disgusting amount of flies swarming the porch. 

Now, about the food. The breakfast burritos were HUGE. I mean, huge. I was pleasantly surprised by the size of the burritos (did they up their portions??) and was able to take half home with me. Good thing, considering it was nearly $7. We also ordered horchata but there was so much ice it was sucked down in no time. Note to self: next time ask for light ice.

Okay, so that visit I was surprised. Maybe I was wrong? So my second visit I called in three breakfast burritos to go. I'm imagining the last burrito I had and think surely I can't be disappointed. Wrong! I pick up my burritos, pay $19.33 for them ($20 on breakfast burritos?!) and they are measly! They are HALF the size of the previous burritos. What the hell? Consistency please! 

I really don't know if we'll be back or not.. I'm thinking third times a charm and maybe they'll have things figured out by then, so maaaybbbeee we'll give it one more shot. Like I said, I'm torn. I really do want to love America's Taco Shop.I had high hopes for Metro after longing to visit after my last dinner which had left a good impression on me . Despite some positive press review, I found Metro to be terribly disappointing this time around and lacking substance or lacking for a better word.

Service started off great and then went aloof from there as if we did not exist. The breakfast was nothing reminiscent of a French bistro or brasserie whatsoever. What happened to the wonderful croissants and pains au chocolat ? Borrowing from another review, service was indeed ridiculously slow and indifferent.

I really wanted to see you succeed Metro, but I kinda lost faith. I hope you put a little bit more work in the service delivery and decoration of your awfully cold and depressing dining room.Good coffee and fabulous service. I like black, medium bodied coffee. That's why good coffee is important to me, because I don't put anything in it. I know the difference and this is good coffee. Not the best, but good. The thing that makes this a stand-out place for me is the service. The staff goes that extra mile. It's a fun, pleasant environment. Good place to start the day.I had a lovely girly night out recently that involved cocktails and Chinese food... and then me going home because I'm an old person and turn into a pumpkin if I'm out late.  

Anyway...

I've struggled to find decent Chinese food in Edinburgh and currently live down the street from a Chinese take away that smells amazing but serves up greasy awfulness, so when a coworker of mine told me about Wok and Wine, I had to check it out.

The restaurant is decorated in a manner that I find pretty standard with Chinese food places I've visited before - in kind of a non-hip modern way.  Clean, rather sterile, but comfortable.

We were taken to a nice little table and left with the extensive menu which (top points!) offers all full sized dishes in smaller sizes so two people can try quite a few different things in a tapas-style meal.  

We opted for a good mix - one order of veggie dumplings, a pork dish, chicken satay, crispy beef, and shrimp and veg tempura.  

On the plus side, everything came out immediately and was piping hot.  Unfortunately it all came out at exactly the same time so we felt pushed to eat quickly so it didn't get too cold.  We also discovered that the "small" dishes are actually hardly small at all and we really ordered WAY too much food.

The chicken satay and crispy beef were very tasty, but the tempura -which I had been looking forward to since I saw the menu- was a huge let down. I found it incredibly greasy and salty.  The texture of the batter was nice and light but the grease literally dripped out of bits, and the combo of salted batter with salty teriyaki was too much for me.  

The other dishes were fine tasting and well made, but just not entirely to my taste.

Despite this, I would return.  The service was lovely and attentive and to a certain extent I think we just got a bit unlucky with what we ordered.  Add to this the price - five dishes plus rice and two beers for £40 - and it's really good value.  Just keep in mind it's cheap and cheerful and if you order as much as we did you're bound to find something that doesn't quite float your boat.A nice little greasy spoon a few streets from the heart of Edinburgh that's more like a greasy silver spoon. 

The venue itself is a little small and there isn't really any room to sit down, but with all the nearby parks it's not a problem.

The sandwich board claimed they offer a range of "Continental Sandwiches" but I didn't really see anything you couldn't get somewhere else.

They do vend Costa coffee however, which works out a little cheaper when you buy it in here rather than a Costa branch (only by about 10p though). The latte they made me was lovely.Went here for lunch one day when couldn't get in anywhere else (Festival time) they had a good concept on the menu and did their best not to let us get away but this was a busy time and we probably waited a wee bit too long. The food was good it was a french take on Tapas basically, but the coffee was not great and despite 2 attempts the staff didn't seem to know what we were talking about. More training required.

None the less I would be happy to try it again maybe for dinner next time.Interesting and free museum that was pointed out by the bus tour guide at one of the stops. It's located just up the hill from Holyrood and across from Canongate Kirk.

Edinburgh history, going back quite a number of years. Many interesting displays of the city, including armor worn in the 17th century, a policeman's uniform and truncheon from the 19th century, lots and lots of silver bowls and cups. One room dedicated to the women's suffrage struggle including a looped video with interviews of several participants.

It's a very twisty windy place with room after room of interesting items and just when you think you might have come to the end, there's another room beyond!

Several rooms with activities for the kiddies.

Definitely worth an hour or more of your time to learn about the history of the city of Edinburgh.Cool thing to be a bar made completely of ICE...and the staff was VERY nice (hence the 3rd star)....cool experience (literally) I guess BUT not worth the price to get in. We got 2 free "Shots" for entering , which got me excited because I was thinking Jager but was served a "house shot" of what tasted like Kool Aid which gave me a typical "WTF" face and made run of the mill  jello shots seem like they were made of moonshine. If you like shots with no alcohol and touristy things then I have a tip for you: go to Coyote Ugly in NYNY... where at least a hot , half naked girl in a cowboy hat and daisy dukes pours it in your mouth from atop the bar......... People back east need not bother... just go outside in the middle of January with a frosted glass of alcohol and you are already there. They do have a full bar and bottle service (for the insane) so you do have options. The Ice glasses are rad and the attire is pretty arctic inspired. The bartender told us that one dude (who no doubt was wasted from the Kool Aid shots) stayed in there for 6 hours...shirtless....Hey , its Vegas...After a couple of beers and 30 minutes , we were ready to get back to the Strip and warmth.Food:
-Table-side guac, best and freshest-tasting guac ever; little guac man actually pushes a little cart full of ingredients to you and makes the guac, by your table-side
-Street corn, good, liked the option of having the corn shaved in a bowl instead of on a cob so I didn't look like I'm from Sparta eating
-Chorizo porchetta, decent but not the best pork shoulder I've had, wasn't as tender as I'd like, tasted more gamey than I'm used to
-Green chili duck confit, I didn't try this but feedback from my dining partner was thumbs up
-Pumpkin bread pudding with ice cream and pomegranate pieces, I approve as a dessert connoisseur
-Espresso churros, interesting but was just okay; didn't like the milkshake you're supposed to dip the churros in, hate alcoholic taste in my dessert stuff; churro sticks looked like poo on a plate

Service:
-Our waiter memorized his menu spiel but didn't seem too genuinely enthusiastic about anything, was very fatigued (or stoned?) looking the whole time, also his stoned smiles made me feel uncomfortable/creeped out
-Forgot our orders for a really long time and I almost got full on chips, the waiter didn't try to make up for it but just did his creepy-stoned-smiley-apology

Ambiance:
-Very nice setting, one of the few outdoors patios I like
-Lights are too dim and I couldn't see shitHad a buffet here a number of years ago but this week's visit was the first sit-down meal I'd had in this hotel restaurant. Ordinarily I'd not have chosen it but it's close to work and they'd a two courses for £8.50 deal on that suited my party's needs.


 The deal was available as advertised & the staff aware of it so no complaints on that score. Both the white & rose wine ordered were pronounced enjoyable. All meals were served with the minimum of delay (we were though practically the only customers between 6 & 7) and no-one could fault the presentation or taste.
On the downside I think there need to be more than 3 oatcakes with the farmhouse terrine as it is a good sized portion you're served and the oatcakes were completely absent from the cheese selection I had for dessert. We also ordered chocolate ice-cream but received vanilla.


 All in all average but pleasant which is probably the best that a lot of such places can aim for seeing as the main income of hotels is from accommodation.Pretty good pharmacy service. They never tell me they are out of whatever medicine I need. Smaller branches of Boots have this problem at times. They have a great selection of cosmetics, toiletries and nostrums for sale but prices are generally better elsewhere. Stand out products are the Boots own brand skincare lines and their cheaper make-up line called 17.Cab Vol for short. I was always under the impression that this was filled with Uni students, however there does seem to be a following of late 20s going as well. Personally drink prices aren't anything special, nor is the music but like many places in Edinburgh, the venue itself makes for the great experience. 

Based on 2 floors, upstairs although featuring a dance floor usually becomes host to larger parties relaxing in the big booths underneath the stone arched ceilings. Downstairs boasts 2 bars and a few different rooms to get on with dancing. Personally the music is sub-par, featuring alot of techno. Drinks are what they are, for being advertised as a student venue I can't say their prices match this standard. 

Great on thursday nights when there is no cover. Open till '3am usually starts to get busy around midnight.Friendly place with a good selection of drinks. Very good chocolate fudge cake. Small selection of panini and bagel fillings (three or four of each) but they change them every few months. Nice place to sit and relax and read the papers over coffee.Great people watching! I mean it was a Friday night and not only did me and Dottsy Z score a great parking spot, but we also scored great seats at the bar. The drinks we had were pretty strong, small but strong but the bartenders are NOT the friendliest of the bunch. I get the fact that you are busy but  you can pretend to actually like the customers you are serving. One of the bartenders got upset because a patron was saving a seat next to her for her friend who was trying to find a parking spot. He said to her that since it was soooo busy she could not save the seat (since there was this massive line of people waiting for said seat-- said sarcastically of course) We were a little put off but whateve. Or when the group that was celebrating a friends birthday and the birthday girl asked for suggestions as to what would be a good drink, he told her to read the menu to see the ingredients in the drinks and go from there. Ouch! However It didn't stop us from having a good time, it just made this review even more interesting.  All in all, great people watching, small,expensive but strong drinks, and not so friendly bartenders.We go there for lunch a lot on the weekends. Close to the house. Love the calamari with the special dipping sauce. The club sandwich with taro chips is yummy and can be split between two people. Other things we like are the chopped salad, flat breads and sushi. Had the Hawaiian rib eye for a special occasion with mashed potatoes and broccolini topped with a grilled pineapple and it was delightful. Service can be a disappointment (maybe just Sat. lunches). They seem to be there when you do not need them and not there when you need them. On a few occasions we had to ask for some small plates while sharing a starter or desert. You would think they would just bring them automatically rather than watching you drop food all over the table while trying to get it in your mouth. Just ask for extra plates ahead of time and chopsticks if you wish. They have them. I'll be back!I went here today for lunch and I was very excited b/c it smelled so good as soon as you walked in. I ordered the $7 sandwich that comes with 2 kinds of meat and I added the 2 sides to make it a combo. I went with chopped bbq and spicy sausage. OMG the sausage was delish! but the chopped bbq got cold quick..that or it was already cold - and kind of dry. I'm from West TX and brisket shouldnt be dry if prepared correctly and cooked to perfection. I wouldnt order the brisket again but i'd def. order the sausage again. My sides  fried okra and bbq beans. Both were very good. and to top it off they have ice cream as you leave.. oh and someone mentioned banana pudding... mmmm what? and pecan pie.. ooh walk away..walk away.  . slowly out of the restaurant b4 you order something so deliciously sinful. And I did.. and decided to go to the outlet mall right behind the restaurant. I walked for 3 hrs hoping to make a dent in my caloric intake of delicious lunch. I'd def. try this place. oh sides were addl $2.00.  
nOTE: the nicest workers there.. the guy taht took our plates away was so sweet and genuinely nice.. i was w/ my bf so his niceness was genuine!.Service was quick and friendly.  The food was okay. I liked my grilled chicken flatbread, but the meatballs with the kids meals could've used more flavor and seasoning. My husband's dinner was very "earthy" tasting even though it was supposed to be covered in Alfredo sauce. No complaints about anything but the bland flavor of 3/4 of the meals served to our table.Daily Dose is exactly what I expected being in Downtown Scottsdale. It is a cute, trendy, busy, small establishment packed with lots of patrons with Gucci bags slung over their arms and cute little designer sun dresses on their backs.  

The waitress we had was not rude but could definitely have been friendlier. We took about 20 minutes to order, so that could have been a reason for her rudeness. But, I didn't see her smile once. 

The food was ok. Not really anything to write home about and the Sunday special of Sangria was very watered down. 

I will probably go back again because it is a great spot to go and have Sunday brunch with the girls- but it wont be my 1st choice.The food here is consistently REALLY GOOD.  It's nothing fancy - burgers, salads, etc - and the decor is pretty marginal.  But that aside, it is one of my favorite places to go with my husband when we just want a simple, delicious meal without all of the hoopla of getting dressed to "go out".  We usually just skip past the hostess and sit and the bar and watch a football or basketball game, and the staff has always been friendly (although when we do actually sit at a table they could be a bit more attentive).  Also, I've yet to have something I dislike, but the favorites have to be any salad with their house dressing (cilantro-lime) and my husband loves the gladiator burger on the pretzel bun.  The fish and chips are amazing entirely because of the slaw they serve with it - no mayo, all yummy vinegar-y spicy-ness.  I would buy that stuff by the gallon if they'd sell it to me.
 
Reason for only 3 stars:
Sometimes the staff is a little TOO comfortable.  If there aren't a lot of patrons in the restaurant, they will just have their conversations (usually gossip) right over your head - one even belched while we were at the bar.  

Another slight downside -  they play annoying top 40.

Overall - a great place for a tasty meal with an easy feel.I'm a fan of the Grand Lux and actually had a dinner party here several 
years ago. It is of course owned by the Cheesecake factory so if you like their cuisine then  you will be in for a similar treat. 
This place could easily be a 4 or 5 star place for a casual/nice eatery but it seems as if they try to turn some of their food into the food of a much more upscale establishment. This isnt bad necessarily but its often executed not quite as great as they probably hope!
Maybe i'm too simple but when I order a salad I expect to be able to eat lettuce their caesar is large leaf lettuce, nestled onto each other with sparse dressing and two pieces of cheese and no croutons.. really.. REALLY... its a salad.. cut me some slack. Plus their food isn't as flavorful as cheesecake factory, which I dont consider their food super seasoned soooo... its hit or miss but generally not bad.. 
Id go again, but I wont go out of my way to return!This restaurant receives a lot of rave reviews from locals, but I honestly feel it's a bit overrated. Sure, the menu features some pretty good food, but most of the items seem overpriced considering this spot's location, interior, and decor. I read a review that said the food at "Off the Strip" should cost 20% less than it does and I would have to agree with that assessment.

For those who want to play devil's advocate, yes, the dishes here would definitely cost significantly more at a restaurant on the Strip (and I would probably have no problem paying it). But this spot is "off the Strip," remember? 

Even a side of asparagus (which comes with 6 or 7 little pieces) costs $8 here! I know asparagus is expensive nowadays, but that is ridiculous... If I'm going to pay that much $ for that little asparagus, I'd better be overlooking the Bellagio fountains or the Wynn water feature -- not a strip mall parking lot...

I honestly believe this place is only popular because there are so few decent restaurant options for Southern Highlands residents in the immediate area. The staff also does a pretty good job of making their guests feel really welcome here. In fact, according to multiple people I know, "Off The Strip" usually offers a free piece of cheesecake if the waiter finds out it's your first time dining there.

I would recommend this restaurant if you live nearby or you're visiting some friends in Southern Highlands, but I would steer you away if you live on the other side of town or you're a tourist visiting Vegas. There are a lot better options both on and "off the Strip."I think it was mainly because we didn't stay long since we had to take care of some friends that had a bit too much to drink, but my experience at the new club was only meh.

First off, we got here at 10:30 and the line was insanely wrapped around the front already. I guess it's gotten a lot of hype being the new club in Vegas, but can you please get the lines more organized?? It felt like just a mush of dolled up clubheads waiting in front of the door.

Secondly, I know it's sucks to be a group of guys trying to get into clubs in Vegas, but I thought their standards were a bit ridiculous. We all waited in line together and the girls got in just fine, but when the guys reached the bouncers, they said they had to stand in ANOTHER long ass line and pay $30 cover. So to pass up another tedious 30 minutes of just standing around, they tipped the bouncer a bill ON TOP of the original cover. $50/person to get in??? Even for Vegas, that's overkill.

I'll admit, the decor was BEAUTIFUL and I loved the spacious dance floor and open pool area outside. It's basically Tryst, doubled. There's even a small gazebo where they had table games. But let me ask you this: Why would you leave the casino to get into XS, only to find another casino inside? Confused, I still am. The music was mostly house. Bleh. Then again, we did get there early and I heard it gets better throughout the night. Too bad we didn't stick around long enough.

I would probably give this place another try, but only with a group of girl friends. After seeing that crazy line outside, we'll have to use the advantages of being women to get in with no hassle. ;)Everyone in the club was all pumped up when my friends got there at around midnight on a Saturday. It had an amazing setting: poles for girls, platforms to dance on and a huge dance floor which was packed to the brim! The landscape leading up to the club was very artsy, great for taking pictures.

If only it weren't for the DJ playing latin techno house music that night, my friends would've stayed longer. As the night progressed, our energy started to die down and because drinks were placed on these seat-side platforms, they got knocked off a lot and it was hard to dance on a slippery platform. My opinion may be biased due to my personal taste in music but there's no doubt this club's definitely worth checking out, just make sure you check who the DJ is beforehand.The decor was very nice and the place is spacious. 

Unfortunately, this place was empty. But that meant the sushi chef will take his time and cater to us.  Our server was a korean lady, she seemed a little gruff but topped our drinks often. 

Joey, the sushi chef was very nice.  So nice, he gave us tips on other sushi joints he frequents.  

Food was prepared nicely and fish tasted fresh but there was nothing special about this place that sets them apart from the many sushi restaurants here in Las Vegas.C Bar at the Stratosphere. I know.. "Why would you be at the Stratosphere?" Well, the Friday night event for Birthdaycon was at C Bar this year, and I gotta tell ya - it's not that bad! It's the semi-standard circular "center" bar setup you'll find around Vegas (even though it doesn't seem to be in the center of anything). Booth seating around the outer circumference, video poker bar around the inner and tables with comfortable-enough chairs in the middle. Drinks were standard casino fare...$5-10 each. The waitress was nice enough. Bartenders were a little douche-y. But seriously, it really wasn't that bad!! I don't know about you, but when I heard "bar at the Stratosphere" I cringed.  It seems I may have over-reacted a little. There are definitely worse places on the Strip to sit and drink. C Bar wasn't really packed on a Friday CES night, and it's even pretty close to the so-so valet. I don't know why I'd ever go back here, but if I had to, I wouldn't be that upset about it!first time i tried it was for take out. Got the salt and pepper chicken. was very good. also got black bean spare ribs from the dim sum menu. also steam bbq pork bun. too sweet. 2nd time i ate in with the gf. service was slow on the dim sum. a small bowl of soup for 9.99 is outrageous. i mean i understand its Vegas but the portion was size for a toddler. Anyways price overall is a little cheaper then other chinese spots in vegas. Overall if you are at Caesars Palace and need some chinese food late at night  that includes some dim sum dishes, this place to go.Wasn't real impressed , the food was okay but some ingredients are really over powering while the meats are quite tasteless.  The pesto and the 1000 island are sooo strong! The garlic jalapeño oven fries are pretty bland, couldn't even taste the garlic and 1/2 the order was burnt to a crisp . The ranch is wonderful. On the plus side , the pasties are big enough to share between two peopleOn Dec 28th-31th my boyfriend and I stayed at the Tropicana Hotel. We were pretty excited to see how it was going to look after its new renovations. I had viewed their website and heard good things of its new look and wanted to experience for myself.  When we arrived at the hotel, we were not impressed by its exterior appearance, it was just plain white, there was nothing exciting about it at all, it had a boring look.  However, we were not going to let the hotel's exterior appearance influence our attitude on it as a whole. Before entering the hotel, we had to walk around to the end of the building in order to roll our luggage in. The hotel had stairs in the main entrance, which made it very difficult for people to bring their luggage in the main entrance. Once we entered the hotel, we smelled a strong pineapple smell, which was pretty strong. We were able to check in smoothly, and were both impressed with its new look.  All of the workers were very nice and the casino wasn't very smoky. We stayed in a deluxe room in the towers. The section we stayed in was brand new, but the pathway/hallway we had to walk down to get to our room was very warm. I wasn't sure if it was supposed to be warm in the hallways or if the air conditioner just wasn't working. Our room was real nice, everything in the room was new, it had white comforters, black jazz art on the walls, Jacuzzi bathtubs, and free wireless, the rooms were coo. But... the only major problem we had with our room was... the water. We had no hot water one night!!!!! I was so upset. We were getting ready to enjoy the night life and we had to wait about 40 minutes to take shower. I called the front desk and they said they needed to restart the generator.... :/ for real. I've never been to a hotel where they need to restart the generator. Then the next morning after partying all night, I got up to wash my face and the water coming out of the faucet began to make a weird sound, and guess what started coming out? Brown water... I was livid and complained to the receptionist about our experience at their newly remodeled hotel did not meet our expectations, and they gave us a discount. Would I stay their again? Maybe after they fix their plumbing problem.The tropicana is coming on up, the hotel is doing a lot of work to promote and clean up the exteriors to make it more lively.You can't beat the price with 5 people and thanks to a buy one game get a second game free for staying at the Orleans (w00t) it came out to $27 for 10 games and that's with shoe rentals! 

Tons o' lanes with a good selection of balls, but here are the downers:

- No Music Playing
- Lanes were slick (the approach) and when asked to get them wiped they never did it
- Arcade (4 shooting games; which two were working; 1 racing game, SFII and DDR) meh!
- The guests next to us (they were friends of one of the workers and they were annoying as HECK! With no bowling etiquette. And you figure the employee would have 1. cleaned our lane or 2. moved them to a lane with noone near them)

So pluses and minus'. You make the choice to enjoy the lanes here or to go and venture else where say Red Rock Lanes....which resemble Lucky Strikes in Hollywood.Sportsters is one of those bars which is desperately trying to be like those American sports bars you see in the movies. They have TV screens everywhere at every angle so you won't miss a second of the football. Because that is pretty much what this place is- a place to watch the football, with your mates while having a pint and something to eat. Its definitely a lads lad sort of place. I'm not really a football fan so this doesn't really appeal to me, but if you like to watch sport then this place is ideal. Heck they even have TV screens in the booths. That is pretty impressive methinks. 

I quite like the food here. The portions are massive and its great for a big group to have lunch at. Its the type of menu you would expect from a bar but it is done quite well. I enjoy the Caesar Salad, and they used to do this massive sharing dessert which was basically a huge bowl of ice cream, marshmallows, chocolate and sauce. I'm not 100% sure if they still do it. 

I find the drinks to be quite expensive which means I won't go for a night out here.I will just be honest and up front... I am not a fan of buffets. It is impossible to have food sit out under a heat lamp and be as good as a dish served fresh. With that preconception in mind....

Atmosphere: The cleanest buffet I have ever been to. There is soothing music playing in the background. The music is not loud enough to be annoying but rather creates a nice ambiance. The walking aisles are wide enough for easy movement to and from the buffet area which is centrally located but separated by a half wall partition. 

Service: The service was prompt and polite. Paying the bill was a little confusing because one normally buffets charge in advance and two at a buffet you do not really have a dedicated waiter so whom and when to pay was a tiny issue. 

Food: This is where all buffets fail and it is not for lack of effort it is simply a flaw in the design of buffets and should be anticipated before you take a seat at one.

Korean BBQ: Was actually pretty good because despite sitting out it does not lose its texture. It had hints of ginger and had a nice chew to it.

Orange Chicken: Tasted good but was mushy due to sitting in the orange sauce.

Spicy Chicken: Bad texture and was not spicy.

Fried Rice: Flavorless and had uncooked grains.

Crab Puffs: Ok but tasted like they had been sitting under a heat lamp for some time. They were not crunchy they were rubbery and the filling was luke warm.

They have many other buffet options including non Chinese dishes to choose from but I did not partake. They serve sushi as well. I do not think this sushi contained any fish but I did not inspect too closely because there is no way I was eating sushi from a buffet.

The cleanliness of the buffet was a huge surprise but as always the food was a let down. If you want to go to a buffet and know the food will not be great because it's a buffet then you might as well go here.I only went here for drinks with some friends at night. I was a little surprised that they were asking for a $10 cover charge considering I don't see this place as a full on night club. This place is definitely a scene and certainly has an older crowd if that's what you're into. Drink prices were fair and it certainly was crowded but not necessarily a place that I'm dying to go back to. If you live up in the North Scottsdale/Desert Ridge area, you now have an alternative to Old Town, which is good considering our DUI laws.PRICES: Excellent prices... breakfast, lunch or dinner!
PARKING:  Private lot.  Plenty of parking.  Close.  Good location.
QUALITY:  Fresh food, if you come at the beginning each mealtime.  At the end of meal time, the trays get picked pretty clean.
CUSTOMER SERVICE:  Everyone from the cashier, hostess and servers were very helpful and polite.
FOOD:  A "wide" variety of food, you just can't best it.  Be sure to check out the pictures!
PERKS:  Get a Players Card and you get a discount off the already inexpensive prices.For a Starwood Property this hotel is not up to the standards I expected for a Starwood hotel.  We stayed from 3/2/14 to 3/6/14 and were disappointed in one fashion or another.  Confusion upon checking in, room not serviced by the housekeeping staff.  Housekeeping staff was disingenuous, and didn't pay much  attention to providing timely service.  One bright spot was the warm and friendly staff, particularly Nick and Jamie on the front desk.So, my new latest thing is Hawaiian food. I have several Hawaiian co-workers, one who just left whom I miss dearly. Pining for her Aloha, I decided to try Hawaiian cuisine, and I am HOOKED! In the past month, I've been to three different Hawaiian places.

Ohana is the location closest to me, so I stopped on the way home from work. Now, on the other two places I went to (L&L off of Sunset and Stephanie - it's a chain, so I don't know if I will Yelp it yet, and Island Flavor, which will get a big ol' Yelp coming up soon) one of my favorite things is when I walk in, I'm instantly greeted by a big smile and a hearty greeting. But when I walked into Ohana, I got, "Hi, welcome to Ohana."

Oh. Well, that was less than hearty. Oh well, I shrugged it off. I ordered my favorite: chicken katsu with fried shrimp, and an order of pork eggrolls. The wait time was a little long but nothing too excessive, and when I picked up my order, I got a limp, "Thank you."

Eh. I took out my take-out and headed home, maybe about 5-6 minutes away. I dug in, excited for my Hawaiian feast...

Continued eeh. Even with the katsu sauce or gravy or whatever it is, the chicken katsu seemed really dry. So did the shrimp, which is really depressing, because shrimp is amazing. Shrimp is the seafood of the gods. Red Lobster Shimpmania or whatever it's called is like a national holiday and I drag people out with me (Emily R. will concur).. Dry shrimp makes Baby Jesus cry. And the accompanying sweet-n-sour sauce seemed more like the sweet-n-sauce from McDonald's than from a Hawaiian place.

Not that that sauce sucks. But... I want something a little better if I'm not at McDonald's!

It was okay, but that combined with the half-hearted service, it dropped it down to only three stars. I will probably go back and try it one more time to see if I just came in on an off day. I certainly hope so, because the proximity to my house could earn them a lot of my money.It's big, it's "modern", it's expensive.  Still too soon to say if Aria, and all of CityCenter, is going to be a gigantic bust or a harbinger of Vegas's future.  It has a very cold feel to it (not much character) which is both refreshing for Vegas (I do not need staff dressed as characters) and disappointing (I felt like I was walking around a nameless corporation's headquarters).

 There were some problems with the room.  The entry way lights did not turn off due to a faulty switch which took two phone calls and basically a day to fix.  Also it didn't seem like there was a in house safe in the usual places.  So either I didn't look hard enough/needs to be clearly labeled somewhere.

Housekeeping was slow.  The staff is very friendly and accommodating, however it takes them awhile to get your room cleaned.  It took them until 3pm to get the room made up.

As far as gaming goes it is very nice, very new.  The pit bosses are really friendly and I won money so I'm not going to complain :)5 stars for the hotel & rooms.
2 stars for horrible customer service, employees, and management.
Be sure to check your bill very carefully. They double charged me for the resort fees, charged me for an item a manager had comp'ed for us, and didn't apply the $50 credit we were promised for waiting in line 2-3 hours to check in. Room service also took anywhere from 1.25-1.75 hours the 3 times we ordered. When we checked in, one of the 2 light bulbs in our bathroom was out, so we had to wait for 'engineering' to come and fix it, which they were nice about. No late check out either, on a Tuesday! I had to beg for a 30 minute late checkout.

The hotel, rooms, pools, views, everything is beautiful and not too tacky or gaudy like much of Vegas. Nice and quiet. But the mismanagement is too much for me to handle.Front desk was rude and don't know if it was because we booked through priceline but she surely changed her attitude after my husband tipped her for a better view.  However their bed is one of the BEST beds I've ever slept on if not THE BEST.  Their remote control for the room is pretty cool.  Other than that it was okay but for the price (which was a bit even by booking it through priceline) I would rather stay at the Trumph or Mandalay.Family business always have a soft spot in my heart. Big mama runs the show she is nice and speaks fluent English no accent. So I can see this place being a pleasure to order from. Yes they deliver it is a $2.00 charge. I ordered out and it was fast and smells delicious. Lunch specials are great! Under $6 for lunch from 11am-4 pm.  Mama Beijing I will be backVisited the M Resort Studio B Buffet twice now for the weekend seafood night.  They layout is pretty nice but on the large side.  Lots of tables = a lot of people for dinner service, easily 300 in a seating.

Selections for the Seafood night are very diverse and I wouldn't necessarily say they offered a lot of seafood, but they did have good quality choices in hot and cold snow crablegs, oysers, shrimp every which way, and a pretty good Salmon roasted on a bamboo plank.  The crablegs were meaty and firm, pretty good quality if you think about the volume they must go through for the night.

The selection is rounded out by your usually salads and veggies, bbq, asian, and Italian fare.  Overall the quality of selections were very good but in any buffet it is difficult to maintain quality on every dish, especially if your items hover around 50+.

As a bonus they do serve wine by the glass (think 2 buck chuck brand) and draft beer (Coors Light, Pabst, Primo, and Cider).

Service is good, our table of 14 never felt like we had to search for our attendant.

Line gets long so I would try to show up early or bring a book.  A little pricey at $29.99 for dinner but add the free alcohol and I think it is worth it.This is the first time I ate here other than for breakfast and I was not happy. First of all Lunch starts at 10:30 to 2:30 and it was very busy. We got in line at 10:10 and did not sit down until 10:40. Our waitress was very nice and funny so this was helpful. Went to the line 3 times to try different things. Tried the cheese pizza and it was still doughy. Ceasar salad needed more dressing. I loved the stuffed Rigatoni and meat balls. I loved the Apricot chicken and the Russet Mashed potatos. The mac and cheese had no flavor, the egg rolls tasted nasty and the sweet and sour sauce did not help. The taquitos smelled like BO and I know that was crazy but, it did. I liked the chicken sliders, antipasta salad and the ribs. I was very disappointed in the dessert bar. The cookies were hard as rocks!!  We wont be coming back for the Lunch or Dinner. Thank goodness I had 2 for 1 coupon..This isn't authentic Mexican food, but it is very fresh and pretty good. The beans are excellent and their sauces are great. The food is made right in front of you, which is awesome, but the lines can get very long and when they do, if you have a plate going through the oven to warm, it might come out half warmed up. A few times this has happened with my cheese enchiladas, with the cheese inside being only half melted and the rest still cold shreds. It's pretty pricey for what you get, but they do have a punch card for every ten meals you buy you get one free thing.I don't find myself in the area often, but I was in the area visiting with one of my friends who I don't see nearly as often as I should I remember the buzz about the brunch options here. 

We arrived around 11 and were seated quickly. The layout of the restaurant is just awkward. The aisles are tight to say the least and the booths were even tighter. As we were sitting the wobbly table bucked up and nearly fell over. Lesson learned, hands off the table. We sat and waited quite some time before anyone approached us for a drink order. This was fine since we were catching up and distracted after not seeing each other for so long. 

Eventually a waiter came by to take our drink order but it was hard to get his attention with any more questions since the aisles were so tight as he was talking to other tables. We again sat a while, trying to figure out exactly what to do since no one told us where buffet was and we were tightly crammed in a booth across from a large family that had a child in a high chair that took up most of the aisle. Finally, we headed to the buffet area. It was jam-packed and there was quite a line. We waited patiently, but we were constantly having to move aside to let people pass and vice versa. The line was pretty slow, but we eventually filled our plates and headed back to the table. The food was ok. Nothing amazing, but I did quite enjoy the fresh tortillas and unlimited margaritas and mimosas. I didn't drink too much, but felt I got my money's worth. I think they need to have a better organization process for filling up the buffet as it got pretty sparse with the crowds of people waiting in line. Not sure if they could situate it in a better place in the restaurant but it was definitely in an awkward location since the walkways were narrow and the buffet is also on the way to bathrooms which makes for quite some congestion while people are waiting for their food and while the waitstaff is trying to transport drinks from the bar (which is also in this same small area) to guests.

The food was pretty good and I was happy with the meal. Service was slow to begin with but as we sat there longer the servers finally started coming by with refills more often. I'd come back but maybe a little earlier to avoid the rush and request a table in a more open area of the restaurant, like the bar area, that was easier to get up and down from. I'm actually kind of surprised they didn't try to fill the bar area that is closest to the buffet with those partaking in the brunch and trying to put more a la carte guests in the back harder to get to booths. That's what I would suggest for better flow in the restaurant.I was hoping for more Cirque and less singing/dancing.  Alas, all other tickets for Cirque du Soleil shows were sold out for the evening so we decided to give Viva Elvis a whirl.  I have always hoped and dreamed to go to a Cirque show, so I can at least cross that off my bucket list.  Next time, I will go to a different show.  At times I was mildly bored.  Don't get me wrong, Elvis is the bomb and all, but I want men in leotards zipping across the stage and acrobats doing daring aerial stunts that will forever amaze me.  I got that in a super small side dish kind of way.While I want to love this place, everything about it is just mediocre. It's a long ways from the Serendipity in NYC.

While the inside is cute in some ways and what you come to expect from a traditional ice cream parlor, it seriously lacks ambiance. It is just a little too bright, a little too sparse, not quite clean enough, way too busy, and too many screaming children.

The wait here can be insanely ridiculous at times. And the wait isn't really worth it. Come back when it's not so busy.

Personally, I prefer to dine outside. While service always seems to be slower outside, it is good people-watching and just a better experience overall.

The food is good. I've never had anything bad. I've also never had anything crave-worthy or exceptional.

One of the best things here is the wings. Definitely one of the better places in Vegas for hot wings. Very meaty and good quality wings. Lots of sauce with just the right thickness and spice (sauce has a hint of cinnamon too). Excellent blue cheese sauce for dipping.

The hot dog, mac 'n' cheese, etc. are all good. Again, never had anything bad. But none of it really stands out either. And while one could justify the prices because the portions are huge, it still just all seems way over-priced.

They have a great list of sundaes and other desserts. And all have been good. But there's nothing great about any of them. The ice cream isn't anything great, their hot fudge sauce isn't anything different from anywhere else, etc.

Skip the cocktails. While they mostly all sound good, none of them are actually good.

Mediocre. Everything is just fine, but nothing is great. That specialness and uniqueness and sense of magic that you experience at Serendipity in NYC just isn't here in Serendipity Vegas.My girls and I really wanted to try this place, and we ordered 3 different frozen hot chocolates and a chocolate sundae. The frozen hot chocolates were good, but I guess my expectations were high. They didn't taste that amazing. The sundae was also incredibly sweet and we couldn't even finish it.

Personally, this wasn't really my kind of dessert place, but I definitely think it's worth a try when you're in Vegas.What can I say, each time I'm here there's always a wait. But that's pretty much all the negative I have about the place.  

The food here comes in large portions that even someone like me will have a hard time finishing.  I ordered the strawberry milkshake and the spicy penne pasta with huge uncut prosciutto and mozzarella laid over the top, and my gf ordered the wood grilled salmon item (I think it's the only salmon featured item in the menu). 

So now it's been three days and I can't stop thinking about the milkshake. The pasta on the other hand was so much that I couldn't even try to finish half of it after sharing a caesar salad with my gf.  I didn't think much of the salmon but my gf ended up finishing her meal completely.

The biggest thing to take note of this place is that food comes in larger than expected portions. It's a good thing, but dangerous when eat your entire meal and you realized you have to talk two Vegas blocks back to your hotel.Meeting friends here for dinner tonight, two had blintzes, one had the veal shank special, and I had the Cuban sandwich.  I haven't been here in over a year and nothing has changed--including the menu.  

My Cuban sandwich was good, and it came with fries (my choice).  Service was good and I really have no complaints.  There's simply nothing compelling about eating here that makes me think, "Hey, I think I'll go to the Rampart and eat at the Promenade Café.I don't think anything beats Yogurtland.  I'm not into your normal flavors like vanilla, chocolate, tart, and strawberry. This is why I love Yogurtland because they come up with flavors like PB&J, or Salted Caramel pecan.  You can't get those cool flavors at U-Swirl. But they do  have great toppings to go with your normal boring flavors.  The shop is clean, and their open fairly late.  So if there isn't a better option in the area, this place will still fulfill your need for froyo.For lunch today we went to Corleone's, a Philly cheese-steak joint, located south of the Ultimate Electronics, along the north side of Butherus; just west of Hayden.

We've driven by them for years and we were never swayed by their signage and marketing...kinda francheesy.  I've read the other Yelp posts on the place, and I can see right away that many reviewers have never had a real, traditional Philly cheese-steak.  Don't get me wrong, real...doesn't mean quality.  In fact, the real-deal in Philly is a greasy, bready, Cheez Whiz laden beast with over-grilled onions.  You've really got to like the-whole Philly package to get into Corleone's, as they do their best to deliver an authentic sandwich.  My feeling is that the best of Philadelphia actually put more Cheez Whiz on the sandwich, which can be a-bit much....but hey, how can you argue with tradition?

Corleone's is a bit pricey at first-brush and they try to nickel-and-dime you if you want to customize your sandwich.  However, their two-for-1 special, everyday from 4-6pm, makes up for it; that, and kids eat free on Saturdays.  The restaurant was clean, and the menu simple to understand; though, oddly, many drink accessories (straws, etc.) are too high for children to reach. The atmosphere is simple with three televisions flickering; with three different programs...including one with Rocky III.

After discussing it with the family, we give Corleone's a 3 to 3.5.  The food was authentic, and the service was very good; for a food-counter joint.This is the second time I've been here.  My daughter loves the appetizer platter and the basil chicken is good but was not impressed with my noodle dish.  Not my favorite.  I liked the basil shrimp I had last time better.So Masa in NYC is reputed to be the best sushi restaurant in the country.   And to promote the new Aria hotel, MGM has giving away $100 dining credits to any of the Aria restaurants.  So hearing they opened a Bar Masa in Las Vegas in the brand new Aria hotel, we figured we'd try it out.  $100 dining credit would at least put a bit of a dent in the huge bill that we anticipated.  Because this place is very expensive.   More so than I expected

I absolutely love sushi so I was really looking forward to trying lots of their sushi.  Unfortunately, we learned from our server right away that their orders of nigiri are for one piece, not the normal 2.  That really took the wind out of my sails.  So after ordering tuna, salmon, yellowtail and toro, and the kampachi jalapeno appetizer, the $100 dollar credit was pretty used up.  We realized that this would get super expensive if we kept ordering sushi so we stopped.  Their sushi selection is very good though, having lots of things that you won't find at most other sushi places.  But we stuck to the stuff we knew for our first time there (Who knows when the next will be) and the quality was really great.  However, I didn't think it was so amazingly better than a lot of the great places I've eaten at in California.   30 dollars for 2 pieces of toro is alot.  12 for salmon, etc.  The kampachi appetizer also had salty potato bits on it which I though took away.   We also ordered a yellowtail with scallions (negi hama) cut roll which was great.  The wasabi was great and my wife enjoyed the ginger, but that should be expected.  

We then ordered some hot food.  We got the kobe beef sukiyaki and their black cod dish.  Both were very good.  My wife thought the cod dish at Ame in San Francisco was a little better but both were very similar.  The kobe beef was very tender and flavorful in a good sauce.  The mushrooms in it were excellent.  

I know others have complained about the service, but I thought it was great.  They were very attentive.  Our food came out fast and our server was definitely helpful.  He told us before ordering that sushi orders were only one piece.  

So overall, it was a different and good experience.  The food was very good but it was definitely pricey.  The $100 dining creidt helped alot, so I recommend taking advantage of the deal MGM has been running.  At this point though, knowing I can get very good suhi at other places for half the price, I can't give this place too high of a rating.  I am glad that we tried it though.I've eaten here a couple of times, and each time my my expectations have been lowered. The first time I ate here I LOVED lemongrass!! Then, I came again, and again, and this last time- I'm sorry but it was weak. First of all, I REALLY like Thai food, so when I walk in I pretty much know what I'll be ordering. One of the people I was eating with asked the server which of two dishes he recommended; he obliged and recommended the green curry, while basically trashing yellow curry. Well, guess who likes yellow curry? Yep, me! He noted down green curry in our order; but I made him change it cuz he ordered what he wanted, not what I wanted. (first mistake!) He suggested we have rice with the curry- okay- to be expected. Then he suggested we order the soft shell crab fried rice. It's like the guy just wanted to pump us out of our money! It was really annoying. This has been the 2nd time I wasn't happy leaving Lemongrass. I think I'll have to find somewhere else to get my upscale Thai fix.Yeah, it's definitely one of those places where if you need service, you flag them down. You don't wanna sit there waiting for them to assume you need something.

We didn't get any lunch specials or anything because they probably counted it as a holiday (it was July 3rd).

My Canto friend ordered us fried rice, this one type of noodles, and this Mongolian Beef that wasn't on the menu. The menu actually has a really yummy taste, but it's just REALLY CHEWY. That was the only bad thing about that dish. Otherwise, it would have been epic.

I don't think I'd actually come back to eat here unless it was just convenient and just there in front of me. Maybe I'd have to come back to try the lunch specials once or something, but eh, I don't know.This place has good enough food but the means of getting reservations is horrible.  48 hours notice and filling out a form I'd fill out at a doctor's office is pretty ridiculous.  We're in a fast paced society that work a lot through our phones and it's silly for me to go through the hassle of online reservations when I can't call during a meeting, etc.  I wish you'd come up with a solution.  I've heard others say the same and I think if you made the online process easier we'd be apt to visit more.  I hope you take my advice!!I've been coming to Samurai Sam's for a while.  This location used to be a Rubio's in case you've not been in the area recently (like me).

Generally, I like the food & that fact that it is wok'ed as you order it.  Sometimes, the white meat chicken is a bit dry (the chicken is precooked) .  The prices are decent.  this particular store had some items not on the regular Samurai Sam's menu, like garlic chicken & sriracha chicken.  There were others, but I ordered a chicken yaki soba & a Low Carb Special (no rice, white meat chicken).  Both items were consistent with the other times I have ordered them. The yaki soba was stir fried & pretty dry (only Teri sauce to give it flavor). It should be noted, their teriyaki sauce is very sweet. Too sweet for my tastes.  The veggies were very fresh & cooked well & the dark meat chicken was tasty & not dry at all.

For those of you who want a quick Teriyaki Bowl, you might be better served at the Chinese-fast-food-place-of-the-black-and-white-bear.

All told, though, YMMV.I came here with my uncle while I was in Vegas. We came around 7 and it wasn't crowded. I ate before at 5 back at the hotel.  So I came and I ate for maybe 20 minutes and I couldn't hold anymore food in me. One because the meat was so bland. Last because the meat was kind of hard too. So it was a waste of me to even come. Oh well. They have a great selection of meats I guess. I wasn't really paying attention. They also have squid, shrimp. They also refill ur drinks a lot. But be warned if u order orange juice they'll give it to u in a bottle. And won't give u another one. They also have hot food and a great selection of soups and 2 selections of rice. Don't get the jello it taste bad to me. And they have salads. They charge for wasted food. And it's very hot in there. And don't where ur fanciest clothes u will come out smelling terrible.Great burgers.burger was good, service was great, the set up is ok but nothing i would expect for a high end burger joint. 
too institutional feel for me, too bright or too something i just don't know?A decent place

For the first few years living here in Las Vegas I was a Albersons fella. I honestly didn't know what smiths was. One day flying home I thought I'd give it a shot, and well I wasn't disappointed.

Smiths is great, the quality of food in the fresh produce section is leaps and bounds over Albersons. They have a better selection I believe of meats and seafood with a great organic foods section.

Where I believe this smiths shines is the pre made and sushi section. I've never been one for pre made dinners, but the selection and quality ain't to bad. The eggplant dishes they have are my recommendation. 

Also incorporating a massive kosher section. I'm not really into Kosher foods, but if that's your thing this is the place for you.

While Smiths might be a little from expensive, the range and quality is far above some of the other places in town.to start the la scalla salad is the best salad i ever had. the portion in my opinion has been getting smaller and smaller i ordered 1 appetizer and cup of soup yesterday they came after my salad????? soup was lentil so so at best, didn't clean the table we sat outside ordered 2 full salads they were smaller than the salad couple next 2 us shared???? they also go a cleaned table as they sat??? sad to review so low but...Large portions, quick service!!

Definitely have some pros and cons of this place. They definitely have a huge food selection, which all items seem like they have very good sized portions. If you are super hungry, you will be full when you leave this place.

The staff and service was speedy and friendly. It was a little slow, but even with them having issues with one of their registers, there was no issue in getting our order and getting our food delivered quickly.

As for the food itself, it was ok. I have been really into greek food lately and compared to some of the better rated greek places in town, this is average at best, but it's not bad in the least. Seems like it is more of a bar rather than a greek restaurant. So, if you are looking for a bar to have some drinks for happy hour, but also feel like greek food this is probably the perfect place for you.As a die hard mexican foodie, I would have to rate the food as about a 3.5, but what's with the "up charge" for cheese and sour cream?  I've always been a big Chipotle fan and am willing to pay nearly $10 for a burrito, chips/salsa and a large drink, but this place really irritated me.  I asked for lettuce in my burrito and received both a dirty look and about five small shreds...WTH???

Yes, the tortilla was pretty yummy and the meat fairly tasty, but I really hate being nickel and dimed for everything.  I'll stick with Fili B's for the cheaper and more authentic version and Baja Fresh for the Americanized Tex-Mex (or whatever) version with a free salsa bar.Enjoyed the Bento Box experience - a selection of 6 items off the menu - which include varied Asian options..... Japanese, Indian, Mandarin, East/West, etc.   It was fun, but more than confusing by the time you received your meal.  You pretty much forgot what you had ordered and, for me, I don't like eating something when I'm not sure what I'm putting in my mouth.   Sometimes there are shells you should be aware of and added flavors or accompaniments you might not want to eat.   Overall, the food was good, but not as "wow" as I expected.   However, it was very convenient for us, as we were staying at the Mandarin Oriental.  It could also have a better view.3.5 STARS

SERVICE
+ Awesome service from staff members! Thank you for tending to everyone's drink requests!

The facility was clean and the set up was quite nice. I wouldn't mind recommending a group party here if you're looking for a venue! It's on the strip and nearby the MGM!A basic lunch spot. 

So the GF and I are walking around Friday afternoon, thinking of where to eat lunch. A girl in one of the entry way of Palazzo was handing out a 25% off card for Lagasse's Stadium, so we said why not. 

You can seat in a conventional booth or in the stadium lounge section, we opt for the latter. Area was spacious. Kind of different and neat, you sit in front of their huge sportsbook tv's. The place was empty, so we had plenty of room to spread out and kick back. 

I had the chicken avocado wrap with fries. Decent for lunch, nothing fancy but nothing terrible. Now thinking about it, chicken a little bland and dry. The GF had the BLT with fries. Nice size sandwich with a nice pile of thick-cut bacon. We both liked it. We also both had Bloody Mary's to start our day, something nice and salty before shooting craps. 

Service was decent. She and the water boy was there when we needed them and then gave us our space. With the discount, it was a modest bill for Vegas. 

So...this place is not awful but nothing great. Just a practical place to have a lunch. Depending on you, 2 or 3 Yelp stars. With the coupon card, you can stop by. Without the discount, you're not missing anything.I don't know what it is about Eteaket that didn't WOW me.  I mean, it's clean and has a great list of teas but, I don't know, something was missing.  Maybe it had to do with feeling like I was in a chain.  Something about the colouring ... I don't know, in my head tea rooms should be a bit like pubs - warm, inviting, kind of funky.  Eteaket didn't really tick any of those boxes for me.

My tea (green Earl Gray) was quite nice, as was the box of creme caramel rooibos that I bought on the rave recommendation of Cressida F.  A bit pricey though - over a tenner for two pots of tea and a box to take away?  That's not too bank account friendly.

All in all it's nice, but doesn't quite give me the tingling feeling that I was hoping for.  Maybe next time I'll just opt to buy a box for home.Came here at 5 am in the morning trying to avoid a hangover, and I was craving pho. Located in what is now called the Quad (formally Imperial Palace) this restaurant claims to make japanese, chinese, korean and vietnamese dishes. Although the pho was very much border lined mediocre, the upside is that this place is open 24 hours. I would firmly recommend to not really have your eye out for this place if you plan to come to vegas, but if you REALLY want to get "asian" style food, and a very late time then maybe this would be a OK option. The other thing about Ginseng is that it's pretty expensive for what it is. Prepare to have you ears be drowned in the sound of asian pop music. If it's your thing then your in luck, but in my opinion, i'd rather eat to something that is not a fast poppy tempo. 

Nice waitress though, and fairly clean space.1 star for the seating debacle
4 stars for the food
5 stars for a great bartender

You do the math.

We had a party of four, but it might as well have been 12.  Although there were several open tables, we had to wait about 30 minutes for no other reason than they were trying to space out the seating so the servers weren't overwhelmed and you didn't have to wait at your table long.  Huh?  I actually saw the hostess seat a party of two at a four-top next to an empty table for two.  So it's better to have me wait in the entry way (along with scores of other people) and become increasingly irritated, with no drink in hand needless to say.  Finally a group left the bar and we were able to sneak in there.  

Enter the bartender with a halo over his head.  My Hula's Hurricane was delivered swiftly and all was right again.  We opted to share appetizers, poke and coconut shrimp rolls.  Now the poke did not sound appealing to me at all because of the whole raw fish deal, but my friend gave it high marks, and rightfully so.  With the soy and sesame dressing and the avocado, this dish was fantastic.  The coconut shrimp rolls were not to be outdone, though.  Perfect with a pineapple dipping sauce.

Would love to go to Hula's again, but will have a flask with me...and a lawn chair.This place is a bit closer to my work than Jamba, so I was looking forward to giving it a try.  Overall it was a pretty lackluster experience, and I don't plan and going back.  

After gazing upon the menu for a couple minutes looking for some kinda fruit/veggie blend, I finally asked the clerk if they had anything and he said "Nah, not really...".  It's all sugary fruit blends, with the only veggie being a Carrot Juice.

I think I'll save myself the onset of diabetes and give this place a pass...Pretty good, but not my favorite Chinese of QC. I had the Teriaki Chicken & White Rice. I tried some of the other dishes and they were great too.  More of a take out place then anything, but there are places to sit.  We will keep testing it out.I moved into an apartment a few blocks from here last August.  I was taking light rail at the time and saw the progress of the build out and the "Opening in October" bitch tease sign, although they didn't open until many months later.  

Did they need the extra six months to generate hype?  
To annoy me?  
To perfect their "no espresso to go for you" attitudes?  

Did the carrying costs of build out of the space and rent for all those extra months contribute to the reason as to why they don't accept credit cards?  

When will someone graffitti their windows with "Cash is for Strippers"?

Space is really cool.  The "green" vibe, compostable coffee cups, etc is nice, too. Although sugar cubes out in the open grosses me out and stevia tastes like donkey ass.

The coffee and lattes, as the three stars say A-OK.It was a Saturday afternoon, the weather was perfect, my bike was shining and I was thirsting for some delicious iced coffee. I'm not a woman of needing the finer things in life, but I do enjoy the riches of a ground bean. Unfortunately, I wasn't spoiled with a quality beverage at Giant. My friend is a connoisseur of coffee, and their espresso was bitter, and my disappointment was set off when they had absolutely no selection of sugar-free liquid sweeteners(diabetics beware). Aesthetically, the location is sure to spark a designers eye for all things contemporary.the best thing at this restaurant is the Vietnamese pork banh mi lunch specials.

Get the lemongrass-infused sausage (pork) and a side of asparagus or whtaever seasonal veggies they have on the menu.

I'm used to banh mi costing me $2.50, but that's in a different US regional context.

Nice interior, I knew it as the former site of Sushi Muramoto's, which I adore. These are managed by the same owners, me thinks.

The BBQ could be better, given it's Madison.First off if this review was just for the staff it would be 5stars very friendly and helpful from pro shop to maintenance crew. The course itself was a little disappointing. It was in good shape but lacked distinction, a lot of the holes it felt like I had played already.Decent! Nothing to write home about. Clean good food!We tend to eat later, especially with it being hot.  The parking lot of Ari Sushi looked deserted, but then a couple walked in ahead of us and when we followed them in, there was a table of four finishing up their meal.

People have commented on it not being "upscale".  Really?  I have eaten some poor excuses for sushi in some fancy-schmany places.  My old sushi hangout in Ohio was all bright lights and formica and Fox News on the tv hanging off the wall.  Hey---I'm there for the fish.  But I thought it was very homey and comfortable and actually might have been a little better lit.

The server was at our table promptly with menus and glasses of ice water with wedges of lemon.  (I like we got lemon without asking---nice.)  I had a little trouble with the menu  just because I was used to "midwest sushi".  (Who knew it was regional?  Where's my Firecracker Roll?)  But when I explained to the waitress that this was our first time at Ari and we weren't familiar with their menu, she was very helpful.

DH doesn't eat sushi.  Well, he does, but it's off my plate.  Apparently that doesn't count as "eating" it.  Anyhow, we started off with the Veggie Tempura.  Really good.  Nice, light batter, not greasy.  Sweet potatoes, zucchini, broccoli....  DH ordered the Chicken Katsu and I ordered the "Holly Molly", (pronounced Holey Moley), which our server warned me was "very spicy".  I also ordered a spicy tuna handroll---I LOVE spicy tuna!

DH really enjoyed his Chicken Katsu---he found it, like the tempura, to be perfectly battered, cooked, and seasoned, and the chicken was of very good quality.  My Holly Molly was quite good---a generous portion, nice ratio of fish to rice, held together well...it lacked refinement.  Presentation and appearance wasn't as elegant and artistic as most sushi I have had.  I think our young sushi chef has learned his handicraft at the prep table and doesn't have any formal training.  But quite good.  The sauce WAS spicy---delish.  DH kept stealing it for his Chicken Katsu!  The tuna roll---meh.  The tuna had been chopped to mush---I like mine to be more toothsome.  In fact, it was so mushy it was not to my taste.  I wouldn't have done it, but DH signaled to our server and told her that I didn't like it and to please take it off the bill.  She agreed cheerfully and suggested next time, I order the spicy tuna handroll and ask that it be "chunky", so I will try that and see if I like the texture better.  

A couple of things.  At my old sushi place---for an additional 3.95, you could add on a bowl of miso soup and a little salad with ginger dressing, which I always enjoyed.  Ari either doesn't offer that (at least not on the menu) and server didn't offer.  Also, I ordered hot tea and it had the oddest flavor.  It tasted like sushi rice.  Like they used the hot water from the steamer.  It wasn't bad---I had two cups---but it was odd.  Oh, and no problem---they brought silverware for my husband to use with his entree without his asking.  

We'll try some other sushi places---they seem to be on every corner around here, but for close proximity to our house, good sushi and nice service in a pleasant atmosphere---I thought Ari was great.  Oh, my gosh!  I almost forgot!  When the server brought us the bill, she also brought us this artuflly carved orange.  It was the best, most juicy orrange EVER!  Fabulous finish to the meal.  We asked the server if it was naturally juicy and sweet like that and she twinkled a smile at us and said no, secret recipe.  I want that recipe!  I could eat those slices of orange all day long!The burgers are admittedly fantastic. They are thick and freshly grilled right in front of you. 

I have to say though. When I was told the French fries are freshly made, I was disappointed to get a bag of precut crimpcut fries. 

And the price to upgrade from a 7$ burger to a combo of fries and a drink increases the price almost 4$ son are paying 11$ for burger and fries... Seems a bit steep. 

Over all I recommend their burgers. I think they are delicious, well cooked and well prepared. But the price is high for the service and quality of sides.Good food, but I thought the price was a little too much. I spent almost $30 for the Swiss Mushroom Dog, the Vegas Dog, the (something) Man Dog, and a small bowl of chili. I ate everything but the Vegas Dog, I was too drunk to finish it. 

Bottomline: I probably wouldn't come back here again, it seems to me the one in LA tasted better.Went here last night. Got my usual chili cheese fries and Showgirl Dog. I don't like crazy things on my hot dog. Just the usuals-- as in all the usuals. haha ketchup, mustard, saukraut(?), tomatoes and bacon-- oh and relish! Definitely have to eat these babies with a knife and fork. Don't forget the napkins!
Chili cheese fries here are delicious. I love their chili. It's a little 'mushier' I guess you can say than other places, but I like it... although my tummy always feels a little funny after. Kinda over priced, but it's Vegas. What isn't overpriced?Came here twice during my weekend stay in Vegas. Food is alright. I had the Chicago dog the first time and the mushroom swiss the second. The Chicago dog is alright, but I kept comparing it to the one I had in Chicago so I wasn't particularly impressed. The mushroom swiss was good, but tasted slightly odd pairing those ingredients on a hot dog. Too much mayo. Some of the crazier concoctions that my friends tried seemed tastier. I had a bite of the chili cheese dog which was good as well as the spicy mojave which was piled ridiculously high. It's a good spot when you're sick of buffets and don't want to wait in the line for Earl's. Otherwise it's just whatever. They take card and the seating is limited to outside tables and chairs.I actually liked HAZE, despite all the mixed reviews I've heard about this place. It was late afternoon on a Friday night and we still weren't sure what club we were going to. We were too lazy to go off strip even though we were guest listed for Vanity and Moon/Playboy Lounge. My friend called the Monte Carlo concierge to see if we could get onto the Haze nightclub guest list (even though it was at the Aria.) The guy said sure and asked what our ratio was. We told him 3 girls, 4 boys and he said "ohhh..." haha no one likes that ratio. He said to try it anyway. So around 10:30pm we walked over to Haze and on the way there we were intercepted by 3 different promoters handing out free entry cards. We all grabbed the cards and headed over to the club entrance.

On the top level, they sort you into different lines. We entered the VIP guestlist line not knowing any better and were quickly confirmed that we were good to go. Then we were ushered downstairs into another pit of lines "girls only" "guys only" "general admission" "guest list" "tables" ahhh! We jumped back into the guest list line and within minutes rolled up past the bouncers, past the cashier and were in the club for free! Even though at that point we were only 2 girls 4 guys, YAAAAY!!

Overall the club is pretty small compared to others on the strip. The music was kinda meh for the first hour and half but then really started to pick up around midnight. Drinks are the typical price (ie., $16 for a long island.) I'd come back again if I was in the area. There was a nice crowd there.Affordable and professional.  But the massages are just OK.  Have used several different therapists, the quality of the massages are not to the level of a nice spa but the prices are about half or less so you are definetly getting better value.My pre-husband and I stopped here for lunch on Saturday.  Still $9/person even though it's the weekend, and the selection was decent.  We didn't have any alcohol, but I looked over the selection and it was pretty good--Tsing Tao, Kirin, and Asahi on the import beer list, and a selection of sake (hot and cold), as well as a house plum wine that you can order by the glass.

I found the whole idea of a sushi buffet a little unnerving, but they were making it there and the nigiri sushi was actually quite good--excellent cuts of tuna on the pieces that I had.  The spicy tuna was decent, and pre-husband liked the California roll.

The fruit selection wasn't bad, although the pineapple was a bit under-ripe.  There were a number of salad options, including kimuchi--the Japanese version of kimchi (think a garlicky, pickled cabbage salad--spicy, but no fish juice).  I LOVE kimuchi but have to be careful about garlic powder, so I went easy on it since I couldn't tell if they'd only used fresh or not.  They also had a lovely seaweed salad, a selection of dim sum, and some soups, along with some standard Chinese-American buffet stuff.

Didn't much care for the pork skewers, and the sesame balls with red bean paste were a little too chewy for my taste.  The gyoza were decent, but had an extremely thick dough--more like shumai than gyoza in my experience.  Pre-husband felt that in general, the breaded items were a bit over-done.

Five different flavors of ice cream, with scoops in the bucket of water just like the college dorm cafeteria of my youth.  I had the green tea, which was pretty good, although not as strongly flavored as it might have been.

Pre-husband said the fried frog leg "wasn't, like, disgusting or anything, but I wouldn't choose to have that over chicken wings.  I don't see why it's a delicacy."  So take that under advisement.  Personally, I don't care for any food with bones in it, so I didn't try them.

Finally, I will say that more than 50% of the patrons in the relatively full dining room appeared to be of Asian descent, and a lot of them were speaking Chinese.  So it's probably worth a try if you're looking for some less Americanized pan-Asian fare, although it's still a buffet.  Decent for what it is; probably more fun if you drink some of that alcohol.3.5 stars.
I am personally more of a Yogurtland fan.  i just think it is more flavorful and more selection.  Nonetheless, Menchie's definitely can satisfy a craving on a beautiful sunny Las Vegas day. 

This location is always very clean, the staff is always friendly, and the topping selection is plenty.  I personally enjoy the fresh fruits and mochi, while my toddler daughter prefers the candy options.  So, although it isn't my favorite froyo place- there is definitely something for everyone.i would probably like this place more if I didn't have lunch here every three days. 

The staff is awesome. I love the way you walk in and every body knows your name. And they're always glad you came. Ha! Yes, just like Cheers. Only without beer. Beer would really make this place. Yeah.... Pizza and beer or burgers and beer for lunch. Yes! I'm in. 

My favourites are the chili, turkey burger, and chips and guacamole. They have a salad bar but I think its overpriced so I don't eat that. Oh they have a half rotisserie chicken thats pretty good. A different flavor every day and at a decent price.I wish 3.5 stars were an option.  I came here on Saturday night to try out their Restaurant week menu.  I have been here several times for their bruschetta, though sadly they have eliminated the filet mignon option.  I started with the tuna tar tar with avocado.  It was seasoned well and quite enjoyable though I would suggest something other than stale heart shaped water crackers as an accompaniment.  I then went with their black risotto (black due to squid ink) with scallops.  I very muh enjoyed the dish and thought it was well seasoned.  My only complaint would be that cutting sea scallops in half and serving 3 halves, each of which is only seared and seasoned on one side is really a trend that should die never to return.  Fans of traditional risotto will find that this risotto is much too thick (think of Wolfgang Puck's outburst on Top Chef a few yrs ago), though truth be told I personally didn't mind the thicker consistency.  For dessert, I opted for the bread pudding.  I am not much of a sweets person, so I appreciated that the bread pudding was not overly sweet.  I would recommend 5th and Wine for a fairly casual dinner.  I also appreciated that the waiter didn't try to sell me on the most expensive option of the 3 wines I inquired about.  
5th and Wine charged $30 for Restaurant week and it was much more enjoyable than Christopher's and Cork-ambience, service and food.Decided on Grimaldi's after realizing a drive into the strip was a bit far and we were starving!

Ordered a Pepperoni, sausage, & mushroom pizza. 

And while I'm biased because we waited so long for it, It was a good pizza with a thin crust (just the way I like it)

I will definitely come back, but if I'm getting to-go I'm ordering beforehand. /)__-This was my first time visiting the lovely Aria and eating here.  Decor is definitely nice and modern.  The restaurant itself was packed, mainly due a convention that was being held at the same time.  It's also very loud, so it can be difficult to converse.  Service was excellent (possibly because we ordered a LOT of food as well as a bottle of wine and alcohol).  We ordered over 20 items, including almost every dessert on the menu, some more than once to feed our large group.  I have no idea what the bill cost, but I'm sure it would have been over $50 pp.  

The food itself was nothing special - I've had much better tapas here in LA at various places.  I'll only gloss over the highlights.  I read that the chicken croquettes were to die for, but I found them to be simply good but something that wouldn't generally stand out.  The stuffed dates wrapped in bacon were excellent (though I must point out that it's difficult to get this dish wrong), the creamy risotto was super delicious, the scallops were good, the pan manchego was tasty, the peppers were a favorite of others, and out of all the desserts, the Spanish creme brulee was the best (unfortunately I have no picture of it, but it was larger than most creme brulees).  Again, most of the other dishes were average and nothing to write home about.  Oh, and the Sangria is delicious and sweet - they add some liquor to it (rum I think but I'm not sure) so it doesn't have a strong wine taste to it.

There's definitely better restaurants on the strip, though this was my first experience in Vegas eating tapas.  I'd say the tapas run on the more expensive side (most are $8 - $16, some up to $30), and we had to order a lot to get full.3-star avg for this place is definitely about right. went here with Justin B, Richard P, Alan W, Kristin A, Tommy H, and a bunch of other friends on a friday night in vegas. i wasnt in the loop with how our guestlist deal was supposed to work, but all i do know was that around 1030pm they made our group of 20+ wait at the front of the line for maybe 20-30 min with the bouncers being pretty rude. after a bunch of miscommunication and wheeling and dealing, we ALL got in for free and the only redeeming factor for me about this place is free champagne or rum for ladies until midnight. 5 glasses of champagne in an hour = FUN! haha

the place itself is nothing special but i am glad to see it for myself after watching the Real World Las Vegas cast party there practically every episode haha. it was practically empty when we got in around 11pm but it slowly picked up as the night progressed. i ended up having a pretty good time b/c all of my friends were together in one place and i cant really complain too much when i only spent a few bucks the entire night just for tips on my free drinks hahaThe Yelp review says this place has four stars.  This ranking clearly applies to the food, which is indeed tasty and fresh.  Well prepared.  Naan was puffy, doughy and crispy.  What did NOT seem to warrant the stars was the location - this place is located in the Food Court of the Riviera.  The excellent food, served on paper plates with plastic forks within the common area of the court brought a feeling of anticappointment - not the kind of ambience the four-stars erroneously suggested.  Come for the great food...but take it somewhere else to enjoy.The only thing impressive is the size of their food

Food not very impressive just big.  I had the chicken and waffles and it was a bit greasy. The giant biscuits were good and the waitress was very friendly.Our food arrived late and was burned. We had to call in twice to have our orders corrected without much avail. The delivery drivers were really nice but the people on the phone weren't very helpful. A lot of the items available on the menu of the Tropicana location were not available at this one. We couldn't get their hot fries or two different varieties of pizza. We settled for a custom pizza that wasn't nearly as exciting as we had hoped & two calzones that ended up being burnt. 

I've had excellent pizza from the Tropicana location, but it's still a bit expensive. I'm still giving them 3 stars because the pizza was above mediocre, delivery people were exceptionally nice and willing to bring back re-made orders and I know that the company is capable of creating delicious pizza. I'm hoping this was just an off night...Honestly, as far as fast food burgers go, this is pretty good. A bit more pricey than the golden arches, but the food tastes better. Service is reasonably fast and friendly and they will add or subtract whatever toppings you ask for when you order your burger.I came here to buy some shisha and coals. The place is in an older complex, tucked away right in the corner. 

It didn't have the biggest selection. :( They had mostly Fantasia and Al Fakher and a few weird flavors of Starbuzz left. But they had Three Kings coals so I was excited about that! :) The prices here were reasonable unlike many of the other smoke shops in the area. 

Overall, small selection of Starbuzz but good deals.  Let me know if there's something better out there. :DI've been to this store several times and have always had a decent experience. My most recent experience was to purchase a new SIM card as i was inheriting my husband's iPhone 5 when he upgraded to the 5S. I was upgrading from the 4S. Terry was very helpful and it was no charge!If I could I would give this place 0 stars because their casino took all my money. lol But to be fair, I thought the rooms were very nice and clean.  Quite roomy and the bathroom was nice and big.  Even though we couldn't get the room with the terrace, which usually is the standard room, it was still ok.  I love how the bathroom was decorated and on top of that they supply the bathroom with Kiehls products for men and women! Nice touch Cosmopolitan!  Only problem I had with this hotel, actually its not a problem just more of an inconvenience is that there was so much free space.  Lots of big sitting areas with statues.  Lots of wasted space I'd say.  I kept getting lost too because apparently there's several different elevator areas.  It took me forever to find the shopping area from the buffet.  I think they need to use that wasted space for something that will bring in revenue.This place has great sales so I check frequently. They also carry a small selection of plus size clothes, which is seldom found in juniors stores. However, I echo the previous comment when it comes to service. I've often walked into the store and have had no assistance when two people are behind the counter helping a single customer. I've also noticed a pretty high turnover; it seems like they're always training someone new when I visit. It's still worth the visit if you're in the neighborhood.I came into this Petsmart because it is close by my house and I was running my Saturday errands at Sam's Club. Typically I get our dog food at Target because I have found it to be the least expensive there. Target was having supply issues with my brand so I went to this Petsmart only to find out that they were also having supply issues with Iams. 

Turns out it's an Iams/Eukanuba thing, not a store thing. I snagged their last small bag of my brand and roamed the aisles looking for a replacement food. It was overwhelming and I felt disadvantage because I'm had not prepared by doing any online searching or research on brands. I was looking for a healthy dog food that did not have a ton of filler. 

I went to the counter and asked for help and their associate came back and gave great assistance and advice. At first I was skeptical to trust the advice of a random Petsmart employee, but I felt she spoke with great experience and knowledge. I purchased her recommended dog food and we began blending it with the old food per the instructions. The dog loved it and I did my post purchase research and found that she had given great advice! Yay! No buyers remorse for me!Service was GREAT....place was really cute, didn't feel like we were in a mall at all. Pizza was just "OK".. it looked better than it tasted. It was a bit salty, crust was crisp...but the underside was soggy :(. You pay for toppings and ours had hardly any.. I was really hoping for a better pie :( I guess I would try it again, but that might not be for awhile.Staff was great. Everyone was really nice. The massage was meh. I felt really crappy afterwards and actually more sore. I asked for certain areas to be focused on and those areas went untouched. I kept anticipating the massage getting better the entire time.... But it didn't. I wouldn't pay for another massage there. I wish I could say better things because the people are super nice... But I don't want people to go expecting a lot and getting disappointed.This is one of the better Ross stores in my area (meaning within 15-20min) seems to be clean and well stocked when I visit most times. 

Employees have always been kind, courteous and helpful. Always a good variety of items in stock, things seem to be pretty organized for the most part.Love the products, but the sales people were a little snobby, Especially the heavy women with the large tattoo on her back. Hey if I am going to pay $15.00 for a small eye shadow you who maybe makes that much an hour can be a little nicer.we have three visit to this place with my family. this place never improve anything at all for past year. samo girls to taking pictures with samo tricks. never get anything exited. anyway, its reasonable price for the OK  shoot. but i am narrowing to groupon deals to some other picture places nowadays.A-OK. Not the best nail shop I've ever been to but certainly not the worst. 

My sister-in-law scheduled appointments for us here since it's close to her babysitter's house - she's not a fan of taking small children places where there are fumes. Plus, that kid is a wiggler so I doubt it'd be easy to do her nails with him in her arms. AND it was nice to get away from the little guy for an hour or so. He's my nephew and all, but leave some time for adults only, ya know?

Anyway, I like the fact that they take appointments and our nail techs were ready to roll. The salon was pretty empty so we were able to sit next to each other in the massage chairs and visit. The massage chairs had this strange function where it felt like it was punching you in the butt, so I turned it off. Maybe that's what people are into in Las Vegas, but not me...

My nail lady was awesome - she got 'er done in a timely manner and stayed pretty quiet. I'm not a fan of small talk when trying to relax. My S-I-L's lady was super chatty, so I tried to tune it out while getting my hands and feet rubbed. 

The mani lasted at least a week while the pedicure only lasted about two. Hence the 3-star average. Again, not terrible but not 5-star worthy either.Decided to stop by Hussong's Catina before a show at the House of Blues. I LOVE Mexican and I'm usually pretty easy to please. The food was maybe a 6 out of 10. The waitress was friendly but borderline too friendly if you're pickin' up what I'm puttin' down. I bumped up the rating by one star because of the a-mazing slash terrible white guy mariachi band with a harp player. The location is convenient if you don't want to leave Mandalay Bay.Not a fan fo sho fo sho.This review is for Corn Creek Station which is sort of like the gateway to the Desert Wildlife National Refuge....sort of a visitor center.

I've been out here a half a dozen times over the years and have always loved this place.

It's not far from Vegas but due to it's lack of paved roads it doesn't get the type of visitation like RedRock Canyon or Mt Charleston. That's probably a good thing.

It's always been a great place to bring the dogs and let them off the leash to run around a bit. There were so few people no one seemed to care.

Well apparently that's changing I was out there today and there is a lot of construction going on. Looks like they're building a large visitor center.

What once was a large pond has been drained and the water is now in a large concrete pond.

What were once nice winding dirt paths can now best be described as winding sidewalks. It looked like hard concrete with dirt sprinkled on top.

And we were told twice by a park manager to keep our dogs on a leash. Guess this guy is instructed to snoop in the bushes and harass dog owners.

Oh well I know lots more beautiful places where no one harasses my dog.

It's still a lovely place and I'm sure non dog owners will love it.Great food and service, but fall short in other areas.

The Barbie, Pep Pep, and Pulled Pork are all delicious and for $7 its just a great value. Just enough to fill you up for lunch, but not enough for dinner.  

Combine with the very friendly service that you can only get from a locally owned business, this would get a 5 star right? Nope, there are some issues.

First, the cinnamon fries at $3 is pricey for what you get. I was disappointed to see them use frozen Ore-Ida. When your competition In-N-Out is using potato that is cut in the store and your using frozen potatoes, just disappointing. There is just a difference between frozen potatoes and fresh ones. I rather get animal style fries and have some change left even though I'm a big supporter of the locally owned businesses. 

Another issue is that you have no idea what the offering is for a certain day. They might be offering their 6 regular items, they might only have half the menu available, etc. Today when I came, they only had the Barbie, Pep Pep, and Pulled Pork. Lucky for me, I checked Twitter right before I came. Had I  wanted one of the other 3 and didn't check Twitter before, I would have been disappointed. I know everyone and their grandma has a smartphone, but at least be considerate to your non-smartphone customers like Lisa L. A simple sign showing whats available for the day on the truck could easily fix this.

The biggest issue with this place is the wait time. 25 mins from the time of ordering is just ridiculous. I could see 10 to 15 minutes, but not 25 minutes. There was about 5 people ahead of me, which added another 10 - 15 minutes wait time before I can even order.  So from the time I arrived, till I got my first bite was about 35 minutes. I know this isn't fast food, but really? I don't even think this was considered busy. Imagine how bad it would have been if it was actually busy. I hope you have 1 hour to spare because thats how long you'll need. Now I know why the lines are so long...

Great sliders, but they need to work out their communication issues, frozen fries, and the wait time. Until then, its not worth me driving out of my way just to get these sliders.Even if the Banshee Labyrinth isn't my favourite hangout spot, personally
( I think I am getting too old for it)
it is definitely worth a visit!

Edinburgh's most haunted bar in the caverns of Old town has a certain uncanny charme. 
You need a certain tolerance for Heavy Metal and might not agree with their horror-themed decoration but hey, which pub has enough corridors to get lost in AND a cinema room with free access? Exactly.

Being dedicated to rock music, the Labyrinth also hosts a lot of Rock bands so get lost in there for one of the gigs - beware of the ghosts though, many claim to have had appearances down there....ehhhhhh, i was really excited to have a ramen shop next to my house.. but honeslty i can't tell difference between their ramen and the frozen one. 
Broth is so-so, and noodles... i think they use frozen.
Their gyoza is not really worth it, neither is their fried rice. 

I guess its okay, if your craving a quick grab, but kind of expensive for not good quality ramen. 
Dose not taste ANYTHING like real ramen in Japan. 

Their boba is pretty good though =D and staff is very friendly.I have been on the look out for a solid ramen house in the Phoenix metro area. This isn't it.

It's not bad. It's just okay. The noodles were the best part, and the staff who took our order said they special order the fresh ramen noodles from LA. The broth (I had the Spicy Republic) was also pretty good, if not a tiny bit over salted. However, I'm used to real ramen, where the bowl is rich with vegetables, herbs, bean sprouts, meat, tofu, etc.  Here, you get noodles and broth and just a few small pieces of carrot, a handful of bean sprouts, a handful of spinach, and whatever protein you choose. THEN, you can add on for $0.50 an item what is typically already in the bowl at a traditional ramen house. 

We also ordered the Japanese curry - also just okay. There isn't anything bad to say about it, but there wasn't anything to rave about either.

Cleanliness and customer-friendly service here were 5 stars - greeted when we came in, the server/cashier explained everything he knew about the menu and made pleasant suggestions. I saw him and the other server do the same thing with all of the other people waited on, so they are also consistent with their excellent service. 

I'd definitely go back, but I know what to expect now. It's a good bowl of noodle soup, but it wasn't the ramen I was craving.Espresso: Decent
Food: Oatmeal was good.  It was obviously microwaved - a little too much for my taste..
Vibe: Drive here and hang out. New.
WiFi: Yes - fast and free
Plugs: ?.
Soy Out?: No.
Score: Good study vibeThe Badger Cafe is a quick place to go to near UNLV's campus. The staff is friendly and attentive. The prices are low, but the food quality is good. I plan to come here from time to time when you are looking for a cheap bite to eat. It's connected to the Rum Runner, so the bar is only a few feet away.Dirty wannaburger. Where else would we go for takeaway on a friday afternoon. 

I think that it;'s not actually that dirty but then you look at the bag it came in and see the grease and realise that you're basically injecting one and a half macdonalds straight into your veins. 

But dang if it's not some tasty stuff. Much better than a macdonalds and using actual meat it's a clear winner in the almost fast food stakes. Sometimes I buy a "soda" from here and abuse the system filling it up at least 3 times before I leave. Take THAT the Man. 

BBQ sauce is free. Get it, get more, bathe in it, realise it's actually not that nice, but it's free.Fun vintage little hotspot. Parking is very limited and the drinks are way overpriced. About $10-$14 if you get one of there specially made drinks. 
I do love this place for dancing though! It's right between the feel of a club and a bar. They play old school through current hits! I first found this place and now my friends have fallen in love with it as well.So far I'm having a Blast. From a majority of all the comments made on YELP about KOA Circus Circus, it sounds like Champagne taste on a beer budget. The Wynn is just down the road ($$$) The reason I chose this site is specifically for the location. I'm extremely close to the strip and in close proximity of everything. As a matter of fact there's a ton of strip clubs down Industrial Avenue that are walking distance from the campsite.  I'm here to have fun, gamble, see some shows, and drink a few beers. I'm also not in the RV that much because I'm hitting the town. However, I'm staying in my 5th wheel with a full kitchen and my own washer / drier hook up.      The site does need TLC such as repainting the parking stripes, replacing the worn out street signs that you can barely read at night and they need to fix the landscaping sprinkler system because they are competing with Bellagio's water works theme. Also if noise is an issue for you a train goes by on occasion, not really a big deal to me since we are in the City of Las Vegas.  On the other hand, the people who work here are very friendly and helpful.  If your not from around town ask the KOA workers where all the good spots are to eat, get gas, groceries. They already hooked me up on some  good spots. The Wi-Fi is great and I have had no issues at all. Also if you have small children they have playground for the kids.     The bottom line is if you plan to visit and lounge in an RV park and want a lap of luxury at 5 star RV site with scenic views and shaded trees, then this place is not for you. Will I be coming back ...YES.This really was disitictly average so A-ok sums it up perfectly.

Their lunch deal really do look like great value, 2 courses for £12 in such a fine dining restaurant sounds tremendous.

A colleague decided she wanted to have her leaving lunch here so offer went earlier this week to see what they had to offer.

For starter I went for the fishcakes. 2 small cakes, with a little salad and salsa. Crispy fishcakes with a soft potato filling and haddock flavour. Pretty darn good i would say. This would on its own merit 4 stars.

For the main I went for the meatballs with blackpudding and mash potato. The meatballs for a fine dining restaurant were erm rustic. Very roughly chopped onion sticking out, quite small and really didnt look like anythign special. The blackpudding was mixed itno the potato and just somehow lacked any flavour at all. The meatballs needed more caramelisation on the outside and a good bit more seasoning. The mash needed to not have blackpudding in it and have more seasining. In such a simple dish while the presentation was ok it just didnt work as a dish at all.

Actually for this dish on its own it would be 2 stars. The service and the fishcakes even it out as a 3 star overall.

Really disappointing all in aloThe food has been consistently fabulous. Most recently, I tried the Vegetarian-friendly NO MEAT HERE... "BURGER" and it was good. It wasn't amazing (like their other burgers), but the fact that they had a well-constructed and thoughtful dish for Vegetarians was awesome enough for me. It featured a shiitake mushroom patty, Japanese eggplant, tofu, red bean, mixed greens, and chili lime vinaigrette on a wheat bun. Pretty cool. I also LOVE their TRUFFLE PARMESAN FRIES and SALT & PEPPER GARLIC FRIES. The toppings are amazing and the aiolis are addicting (especially that Garlic Chili Aioli, drool). The other burgers I've enjoyed several times are the RONIN BURGER, KIKI'S BURGER, and SPICY MISO BURGER. Serious drool action all over the board. I've had the OXTAIL CHILI CHEESE FRIES once and they're pretty amazing too. Basically, I haven't had anything bad. I do enjoy the boba milk tea drinks as well. They're not the best boba drinks, but decent for a craving. The BACHI SAKE SANGRIA is really great too and unassuming.

The SHOGUN BURGER is really great! Loved the pan-seared foie gras and although I couldn't distinguish the Yamamomo Peach and Asian Pear really well, it added a nice sweetness to this rich sandwich. The Wagyu Beef was delicious as well. The Unagi seemed unnecessary though; it didn't add anything significant for me - taste or texture - and it kind of took away from the two main ingredients (Wagyu and Foie Gras). I also tried the SWEET POTATO FRIES for the first time along with my two favorite staples and it was okay. I liked the freshness and it not being salty, but with other amazing fry options, this doesn't come close.

We did have one bad customer service experience where we ended up leaving without dinner and going to another restaurant. It was a rather busy night (and I'm sure they have lots of those) and the communication with seating availability was horrendous. Especially since I had called ahead. There was lack of organization and the gentleman that appeared to be the manager poorly handled the situation. It was really disappointing. Very "off-putting" and since I'm a regular, it wasn't a complete deterrent, however, for my friends, it was bad enough to not warrant another visit. Not a way you want to lose customers! Otherwise, the service is just okay. Which is a real shame with food so delicious.

Update: I haven't visited this location for over a year because of my last experience. I have been to their Summerlin location a few times and prefer it MUCH more. The service is substantially better and it's not as crowded (no tourists!). I would stay away from this location.We did not get inked here but we did drink here. Ha see how I did that. Decent enough club in Vegas but I would never pay a cover for it. The dinks are too expensive and plastic cups, that blows for 12-15 clams a piece. Not going to rush off to this place anytime soon.Freshly made Chinese noodles you can't get anywhere else in the city.

Their menu is quite diverse and you can get anything from seafood cream pasta to beef noodle soup.

I came here on a Tuesday and ordered the beef noodle soup, it was good but the soup was lacking the complexity of flavors and the beef wasn't as tasty and tender as the ones we have in Taiwan. Still a pretty decent effort by a Phoenix restaurant.

Prices are very good and almost nothing was over $10.The ambiance is 5 stars here, really sleek, totally Vegas/LA.
Great dinner DJ (we were here the night Whitney Houston died, RIP, and he played a tribute mix to her).
Food was just OK. I've had better, I've had worse. My scallops (the "special" of the day) were undercooked with a ton of sand grains in them. Unacceptable for the price. ... and for the price, I expected more of a wow factor, but must remind myself, I knew I came to an over-hyped LA joint in LV and should know what to expect by now (mild disappointment).
So, if you want a hip dinner at a fun new hotel, enjoy! If you are expecting knowledgeable service with some serious cooking, try elsewhere like Nob Hill or Mastro's.Went to stk last night with 3 friends. We all ordered steaks and thought they were a little above average. The cucumber stiletto was fantastic as was the mozzarella bread. They had a nice wine list, but you definitely paid premium pricing for it. The dj was spinning good music, but it was way too loud. Felt like I was dining in a nightclub. The room had a lot of energy and very attractive people. Our server was very entertaining and friendly, but a little slow. His personality made up it. Overall it was a good experience, but a little pricier than I thought it should be.Oooo, I love a chic restaurant!  This place is gorgeous.  As other reviewers noted, this place is hidden away.  And the complex is a maze, but when you finally make it to the restaurant, you are pleasantly surprised.  It is very green all around and inside.  You would never think you were in Arizona.  It reminded me of Costa Rica...  

Our Orders:
Anne Boleyn Hot Tea & Herbs: really smooth and flavorful, served in a cute teapot
Healthy Protein Burger: good, the air-fried sweet potato fries were really good!
Green Burger: good
Tuscan Chicken Sandwich: good, large portion
Red Velvet Cupcake: The cupcake itself was just ok, the icing was incredible, but it was a tad overpriced at $4.50 a pop.
Lemon Cheesecake: great

It was kind of hard to keep up with our server (didn't care for that), but on a positive note, the food did not take long to come out.  Solid food, beautiful ambiance.We had a very bad experience with the soup that was served, during our visit, which was very poor indeed. That was a real shame, as most of the other aspects of the place were very good, although the service isn't set up for a quick business lunch, which was what we were after on our visit.

Overall, we said: "Go sample the place for yourself, as it's stylish and has good principles at its heart. Just steer well clear of the soup."I recently tried this place with a few friends on a recent trip to Vegas.  I have always walked into the store to get candy for my niece and nephew since  they have things like Angry Bird gummy candy or Hello Kitty lollipops.  We always passed the restaurant and wondered about the food so we made reservations and had lunch there.  I got the Monte Cristo sandwich which was delicious!  I ate the whole thing even though I probably shouldn't have.  The prices are typical for this kind of place in Vegas, I wasn't shocked.  The wait staff was a bit slow but it's probably because it was lunch rush hour and there was a kids birthday party thing going on.  Try this place at least once.Okay so I slowly and cautiously came back to this spot. It's a good quick option by the house and good when they keep it fresh. I just won't come during a slack time/ right before closing again. I don't think it was food poisoning, but definitely something was off and upset my stomach enough to reject it. The past few times, I've been absolutely fine. 

I appreciate they do brown rice now, I prefer that in my bowls actually. I normally get steak or carnitas but have been getting the chicken as a better option.

Keep in mind that while they tout "healthy" there is still a rather crazy amount of sodium in their food for a "fresh" concept. So if you are watching what you eat, you should probably look online at their nutritional information.

Chipotle is one of those chains that I would begrudgingly say is rather good and is kinda a genius concept for fast food.Went to monta noodle ... try it ...i think its decent but not supper impressing me ... lil cheap on meat aye ,,,, the broth is ok ... a touch more salt than it needed ... lack a lil nature sweetness ( maybe more bone and vegie to bring out sweetness) ... overall i would give it a 6 out of 10 ...A-OK. 

We are on a mission to find the best BBQ in the valley and this was the first place we went.

We ordered the pulled pork sandwich, Chicken plate and some bones to try the ribs, because, after all it is a BBQ place and you have to get pulled pork and ribs.

The pulled pork was good. Nothing that really stood out to be special and the meat was kind of dry. I wish they would have put some sort of sauce on the meat prior to serving (they have different sauces in pumps for you to pick and choose) but since they let you pick which kind of sauce and how much, I guess it makes sense.

Chicken plate consisted of two chicken breasts and some sides. Waffle fries are generic with a cajun seasoning, baked beans were alright, honestly they looked like mush and the flavor was ok. Chicken was good though. Good seasonings and very tender.

The thing that saved the meal were the ribs. Ribs were pretty good! Tender (not falling off the bone tender) and came with some sort of light glaze which was much better than any of the sauces. 

I would have given this 3.5 stars if I could but since I don't think I'll ever crave/have the desire to comeback, it gets a three.I'm still trying to feel out Smashburger.  The first time I went there, I had the Spicy Baja (pepper jack cheese, guacamole, lettuce, tomato, onion, chipotle mayo, jalapenos, chipotle bun).  The guacamole was the dominant flavor (which probably hid any spiciness that was there), with everything else blending together that in the end made for a burger with a flavor crisis.  I also had the Smashfries (tossed with rosemary, olive oil and garlic), which didn't leave much of an impression on me.  Fries with a very mild garlic flavor, nothing special.  After that meal I didn't really feel the urge to go back.

Until tonight.  Why did I end up here?  I really, really wanted a tasty burger; Smashburger was my second choice.  My first choice was Slider Truck behind Yogurtland with a really long line despite only being there for 20 minutes.  Me being hungry and not wanting to wait in line, I headed down Fort Apache to this Smashburger.  This time I had the 1/2 lb Sin City Smashburger ($6.99, fried egg, bacon, American cheese, grilled onions, haystack onions, smash sauce, egg bun), no fries.  So with this experience, it was out with the guac and in with the salt.  Not to the point that makes it inedible, but enough to keep it noticeable as you keep eating.  The fried egg and onions definitely led to a good combination of flavors that satisfied my burger needs.

Would I come back here?  I would, but I wouldn't go back for the two burgers I've already had.  Hopefully I can find a burger that is a bit more balanced with the toppings, since the beef is good.  Three stars until I find that burger.

Yelp love!: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/diY31IEunbV8MfDh81FS1A?select=-dnGD5mHelYtkYVpyuQyYQOk let's get one thing straight when it comes to dining you look for 3 main things to make your experience pleasurable- 1) service, 2) food, and 3) atmosphere! Sometimes one may totally overshadow the other so that nothing can really help it. That is what happened when I visited here to celebrate my friends birthday. Walking into this place it was dark but lively. The hostess were friendly and sat me right away. Be warned Saturday night was busy and they don't take reservations so FCFS. Well Jorge came by and got me started on the Watermelon Mojito (eh, not bad). We ordered the Petit Filet, Duck Roll, Ahi Tartare, Ceviche, and the mixed Paella. Believe me for two people this was way too much but it was necessary. All the tapas we ordered were delicious. The seafood was fresh, hot plates were hot. My favorite had to be the Filet Mignon as it was tender and juicy plus I loved the sides it came with-spinach and potatoes. Everything came out quick too, except the Paella but that takes awhile. While we were eating our tapas the hostess approached us bc she needed our table for a big party. Like who does that!? We were a little taken aback but we said ok. When our server came back to move us I asked if they normally do this and he said they have a few times? What? I've worked in restaurants for over 10 yrs and we have never done that. So we move and we are at a loss for words. We had a momentum of gabbing and it was lost not to mention ppl watching us move. Anyways the manager on duty, I think his name was Carlos, came by to apologize and took care of us but still it was awkward. The Paella finally came and it was enormous! It could feed six ppl. It was very tasty.  We also had the white and red sangria, both were good but I preferred the white. It was like alcoholic apple juice. For dessert we had the tarts which were the size of dollar coins but just enough for us since we were stuffed from dinner. So food was on point. Atmosphere was loud and dim, next time we'll eat in the bar. And Jorge was nice, knowledgable and attentive. But that game of musical chairs while we were eating was no bueno!Nice, casual place in Town Square with decent bar food for very reasonable prices. I would probably put it in more of a drinks and appetizer category personally because the food wasn't spectacular, but it was exactly what you would expect for a sports bar/restaurant type place. The ice cream cake desserts were pretty damn yummy though, plus it's not overpriced like a lot of the other Town Square options...and they have lots of great drink specials. Next time the bf wants to watch a fight or a game I will definitely suggest this place. Kinda reminds me a bit of Shucks...Prices are very reasonable... food is very average"

Caesar side salad was very good. Hamburger quite average. Fries... they are fries, not fresh, but OK. Onion Rings frozen and greasy. Beverage prices, very reasonable. Might try it again at home.Used up a Restaurant Week choice on Francesca's lunch menu, ordering the fried calamari, tilapia, and a brûlée for desert.

The calamari was fried to excellence however the marinara sauce it came with was rather bland a touch too cool. 

My tilapia dish was easily the weakest of the three courses. The fish, while cooked to a nice flake, was as flavorless as can be and slightly on the dry side. The tilapia did come served on a bed of under-seasoned spinach, tomatoes, onions and cannellini beans, which were necessary to add any textural variety to the dish.

The meal was redeemed by the brûlée which was fantastic. Served at a perfect temperature with fresh blueberries and strawberries, the fruit's tartness balanced out the robust sugars and coffee flavors. It's serendipitous I even tried the brûlée as the waiter botched my original order. For once, I can't complain about a service error.Decent Japanese/Korean fast food. Similar in style to Chin's, although a tad more authentic. If you're out shopping at Greenway Station, this would be a good place to stop for lunch (it's across the street from Bucatini and TGI Friday's).James is the sh*t! He's a funny guy, he ran our food and kept conversation with us :). My complaint is: the draft beer is watered down and I ordered a red bull vodka, uhh where's the alcohol ?? The cheeseburger minis and nachos were great!!! Just be careful of alcohol :/Not as I expected. Found the desserts to be overpriced, too 'fun', and really...not that great. While the staff was actually some of the friendliest, and coolest, everything else was kind of blah. I was surprised that "Chocolate From The Bald Man" actually had mostly food, and less desserts than everyone was making it sound. They were actually 'out' of the ice cream pop stick that we were looking to try. At least the waiter suggested we sit at the bar for half off our desserts and coffee during happy hour. Kudos to that!great staff very friendly,  we went looking for really great homemade sausage gravy and biscuits.  Food was ok, eggs and bacon very good.  Gravy  I dont think it was homemade,  its a shame but many restraunts like this add fresh sausage to a canned or powdered gravy,  its ok just not great.  Portion of hashbrowns very small.  Corned beef hash very different had great homemade flavor just lacked enough potatoes, my opinion.  Better than Dennys just not that great breakfast spot we were looking for.I love sushi, so of course I had to come to this place at least once. 
After years of wanting to, I got to go on my first date with my boyfriend. 
NOT a good first date place though, the place has it's music so loud you can't even hear yourself think. 
Staff is always friendly, and the food is sooo good though. 
I hate the atmosphere, I'd rather sit outside. 
We've been back a few times, and will probably continue to, I just wish they'd turn down the tunes so we could actually talk at dinner time.Food is pretty good here. Standard 24 hour cafe food but it's done well. The only thing is the service. It was pretty bad and took a while to get our food. The servers have their own section and don't really pay attention to you too much between taking your order and bringing your food. Other than service though food is good.Went in looking for and eye glass case. Was told they had a good selection. My mistake as the selection was geared to women. Looked like a nice place to pick up a gift for a women however.I wanted to like this cupcakes, specially since I had read about the caramel sea salt one.  I decided to buy 2 of them and one "Special".  I had my caramel sea salt there and I didn't even finish it.  I put it in the box and went home.  The cake part was dry, which was disappointing.  The special was better, but I am not sure I would make the trip to get another one.surprise! another east valley lesbian barWe ate here once. The food was okay, but nothing too exciting. There are much better places to get waffles around Vegas.Food was good, atmosphere was cute, but WAY overpriced for just some breakfast. Small place so a little crowded. Overall, not worth the wait or price.This is a small farmer's market. The variety is minimal. The atmosphere is very friendly though. It is fun for the kids, but if you want to actually shop, not too good.These guys say they have over 1400 locations, but I've never even heard of them until I moved over here from L.A.

Hungry for a little seafood, I stopped in here around 11 this morning for a first visit to this chain.  It's very nice inside for a fast food place, & has lots of comfortable UPHOLSTERED booths!  Some of the Combos on the menu are priced at just $4 & change, so I ordered two of them, & asked them to just put them together.  This brought out a plate piled high with breaded chicken breast, fish, lots of breaded shrimp, hush puppies, lots of fries, & a lemonade slush.

The food was good, & what a feast, for less than I paid yesterday at Chompie's for just a hamburger & fries!I would not say this is the very best mexican food I have had. I do like it. I really enjoy their fish tacos and the salsa is tasty.My only gripe is they do not refill chips and salsa without a charge. One bowl. That's it.We had 5 people and it was a very small bowl. The problem is this is not the norm. So, it usually sends me to the places I can enjoy refills without an issue.I have had good service here and other days bad.Service is sometimes key. Make people fell welcomed and they come back everytime.I went a few sundays ago to grab some quick breakfast before work. I was really in the mood for a good omelet and coffee. The actual restaurant was exactly what i expected, not a cheap roadside dump but a busy sunday morning diner with some classic breakfast food. I ordered the omelet and it was an extremely generous portion. The food wasn't outstanding but wasnt bad either, really just your basic breakfast food. The service was alright, very nice but it seemed like they were very busy and not overall attentive. In the end, i wouldnt say i loved Perk, i may go back some day but I cant say i will hurry backCreative burger choices but overpriced. I got the Rising Sun. Delicious - you got the sweet, spicy, creamy and crunchy flavors all in one burger but the burger itself was just not juicy enough. I love a juicy, messy burger. This one was on the dry side. And the fries? Soggy. Many were burnt. What a disappointment. You can't call yourself a great burger establishment if you can't do fries right. 

All in all, this place was good but not worth the price and did not live up to the hype.For the price paid, I expect perfection. It was very good, but there were a few unimpressive dishes. 

On the bright side, their dessert bar is highly extensive. I filled up 2 plates with sweet treats. Too bad most of them were a bit too tart for my taste. If you have tree nut allergies, keep it safe and grab some gelato instead (it was excellent! flavorful and creamy). The dry treats might have traces of tree nuts.

I will remember Wicked Spoon Buffet as the place where I ate bone marrow. To my surprise, it was pretty good. You just have to add some salt, there isn't much flavor. The texture was interesting though, but better eaten on crunchy bread. It reminded me of eating steak tartare with its soft kind of slimy texture. Definitely needs to be eaten with something rough and dry to contrast. 

The corn was delicious, as well as the shrimp cocktail. Double yum! The fish with lemon sauce was a bit plain. The stuffing and potato were both too salty, and the meatball was OK.  

I would come back, but make sure I have someone pay for my meal next time around.Wicked Spoon seems to be one of the cheaper alternatives as far as buffets go. I'd give it 3.5 stars. They offer a pretty diverse selection of foods, and for an additional $8 on top of the $29 rate for brunch, you can also get unlimited mimosas! Heyyyyy! (:

The food itself was mediocre, nothing really stood out to me. I did appreciate how many of the dishes were presented in smaller portions. This allowed me to literally try a little bit of everything, without feeling bad about wasting it if I didn't like it. 

I was pretty impressed with the dessert selection, having such a huge sweet tooth. A full gelato station, chocolate covered strawberries and marshmallows, cookies, mini cakes and pastries, and so forth, all presented so beautifully! I felt bad eating them because they were so pretty! 

Our server was very friendly and attentive, making conversation with us throughout our meal and quickly clearing our tables and coming back with more mimosas.Quality over quantity! This is a huge buffet with lots of options and everything looks delicious, but most of the dishes are lacking in flavor and very under seasoned. I came here for brunch and there was a good mixture of light, breakfast food to heartier dishes like lamb and steak. They had a large section of Asian food including sushi, pho, etc. but the only decent thing is the sushi. Don't even bother with the pho no matter how hungover you are. It's just greasy, hot, under seasoned brother. 

It was also a bit annoying that things weren't better organized. Breakfast food should have been all in one area, but I had to walk back and forth looking for potatoes, bacon, pancakes, etc. because things were mixed in randomly with no cohesiveness.

Maybe I came on an off day? I may come back especially since the price is appealing (under $30 for brunch).To be honest, I was a little disappointed with this buffet - maybe it was because I had high expectations for Wicked Spoon.

Came here on a busy night and waited for about an hour to get seated. By the time we were seat, my friend and I were already starving since we both haven't eaten anything for the whole day. After trying a little bit of everything, I thought many of the dishes were a little bland. The most memorable thing there was the desserts. Although they were a little too sweet for my taste, I really really liked it! Overall, I don't think this buffet is so bad if you happen to be near the area but it definitely isn't a place I'd go out of my way to get to either.Very cool spot in Vegas (in the new Cosmopolitan Hotel). You essentially sit inside a giant crystal chandelier. Drinks are priced fairly, but as with all of Vegas, it's smoky. 

Get the signature house Cosmopolitan, and chill here for some great people watching!Nothing special about this place other than it's the first Bar when you walk into the Cosmopolitan from the parking structure. I rather be at the chandelier bar. But that's just me. Still always happening just never likes the vibe here. That's why I give it 3 stars. Still, come by and have you're own experience. Cheers.


ArisBe sure to make a reservation before trying to sit down here.  The Cosmopolitan is a fabulous new hotel in Vegas and is very popular.  There were large groups of people waiting to be seated when we sat down and I am pretty sure most were trying to walk in. The restaurant is not very large and dinner takes awhile.  

Fun things about the restaurant is that the head waiter wears a chef jacket and you get to pick your own killed fish on ice.  Their fish is flown in less than every 48 hours from the Mediterranean.  They have all kinds of varieties.  

I found the staff friendly and accommodating.  They did not seem particularly pushy but encouraged certain appetizers and menu selections.  

I think that you have to want seafood if you want to eat here.  The fish we orderd was great but wasn't thrilling.  I didn't have as much fun as other restaurants I have been to in Vegas.  I would take business clients here and family.  I wouldn't go here if your were looking to be loud and drink and just have a blast, so no bachelor parties and the like.  I would eat somewhere else for that and then party at the Cosmo. The hotel is awesome.It wasn't the best but it wasn't the worst. The soup is pretty good & the viet sandwiches are okay, I think I've had better though. It's a half service restaurant too, so don't expect a lot from customer service. Very spacious but everytime I go here there's not that much people even though their food isn't that bad. I think I'd come back only if I was really craving phò and it was the closest one around.It's a great place if you are around City Center and want pizza by the slice. It is not inexpensive compared to your neighborhood pizza place but, you are not in your neighborhood. It is a great concept. No signage anywhere, e.g., hotel directories or in front of the hallway to get there to the pizza (3rd floor Cosmopolitan-left of escalators between two other restaurants w/signage). 

I will keep it in mind for when I am on the Strip and want a slice or two. But, otherwise-pizza quality wise-very comparable to Rocco's on Charleston (Summerlin) except Rocco's is a neighborhood place and the slices are about 25% larger and about 25% less $.Six of us gathered here for dinner. We happened to come in during happy hour (4-7 PM, M-F) and I was more than happy to order a $5 mojito. A decent drink. 

There was hardly anything vegetarian on the menu, so the sushi chef made me a custom veggie roll. It was ok. 

The ambiance is nice and our server was great - but I'm pretty sure we were his only table at the time. 

Nothing was good enough to make me want to go back.Narcisse Champagne lounge and Tea room held a baptism by bubbly as it were with their official Grand opening on January 27th amidst fanfare befitting North Scottsdale's newest "it" spot.

Owners were on hand to greet guests, explain the concept and give tours to hundreds of VIP guests and Local Media personalities alike while champagne flowed freely courtesy of several distributors.

Tasty hors de ouveries, tastes of full sized menu items, including white prawn with sweet and sour papaya, mint and chile and a tender ribeye with beech mushrooms, pearl onions and horseradish mashed potatoes were passed by attractive staff attired in risqué garb.

Not being one who frequently partakes of the bubble it was nice having knowledgeable people on hand to answer questions about several of seventy-five varietals available for purchase by the glass and to keep my champagne flute full.

Wandering throughout the establishment was a performance actress who I can only surmise was meant to be a bubble, uttering not a word nor offering anything more than a blank gaze, this apparition in white amused and confused guests, offering them bits of cloth and balls of cotton from her stash (I'm still unsure where she fit in but suffice to say, she was cool).

*a bit of advice-Never return an empty champagne bottle to the ice bucket upside-down! It shows an utter lack of respect for the prestigious beverage you have just consumed, and worse yet, a tactless disregard for the companions you have just shared it with.

With the opening of Narcisse, the "Beautiful people" of North Scottsdale have a new place to see, be seen and enjoy what once caused the blind Benedictine Monk Dom Pierre Perrignon to exclaim "come quickly brothers, I'm tasting stars!"Not bad for a 24-hour deli in Circus Circus. Sandwiches are large, but a little pricey. Nothing too speical. Just a nice, big deli sandwich, great for late night munchies.The concierge at the Westin recommended this restaurant and given the few  restaurant choices in downtown Phoenix it was okay, but the menu was limited and the "butcher" name not indicative of what was on the menu. The kale salad was nice and the halibut slightly tough on the outside and come with little for the money  The drink menu was interesting and the outside seating pleasant.Pretty fast delivery. Definitely cheaper than UPS; from my experience.Made reservations for 11 people here on a Friday night.  The place is very cute and has a fun atmosphere.  We were sat right away.  The drink menu is extensive and a lot of fun.  We ordered 3 cauldrons of drinks, all of which were sweet but delicious.  I had the lollipop one and it was my favorite.  Also tasted the Swedish fish that was very very good!  For appetizer we had the spinach and artichoke dip and it was really good.  We ended up ordering another because we finished the first so fast.  

The food came fairly fast and every ones looked really delicious.  The prices were all reasonable and we ended up leaving about $50 a person including tax and tip.  It was a pretty good deal.  I had the turkey and brie crepe and it was perfect, I'm glad the portions were not as big as the drinks!  I also tried the pasta and it was surprisingly delicious. 

I would def recommend this place for large groups if your looking for reasonable prices.The food is pretty standard Subway quality. The reason I am writing this review is because I have had 2 separate occasions where the female manager was very rude, loud, and unprofessional. I would also like to make a mention that there should be more training on cross contamination. I've seen veggies fall into meat products or meat into veggie trays and they just pull it out and throw it back in. Either way, its Subway and I still grab an occasional sub.Just visited Butters and it was just OK,  didn't really experience a "wow factor" as others have indicated.  Would try it again and order something less ordinary then just an omelet.  My bench mark is a place called the breakfast club in old Scottsdale. everything i have had there so far in the last year has had a "wow factor", try it.I'm not normally a chain coffee shop fan, much preferring to find that needle in a hay stack small, one of a kind cafe, but given the Gyle offers little in unique experiences, I've taken to frequenting Costa every now and then and, I must say, am pleasantly surprised. The coffees are consistently ok and the friendly service a standout. Not bad at all.Smaller club in Vegas, but it was in our hotel, and we did a club crawl deal so we stopped here. 

They have hip hop here for sure, if you like that sort of music and style. But have to admit, this place was probably more sleazy than the other clubs I've been to.This place is just OK.  Not part of my regular rotation nor is it a go to place for thai food.This place is pretty good for a stand up venue.  It's right down town and parking is not bad if you know where to go.    

It has the typical two drink minimum (soda, alcohol, etc) and the food is pretty good too.  It can be pricey if you dont watch yourself.  

i wasn't a huge fan of the seating.. unless you have your own reserved table, get ready to be friendly with people you dont know.  I get it because they have to cram as much people as possible in here.  But still...

The sound is perfect and there's not a bad seat in the house when it comes to seeing the comedian.  

TIP: Be sure to check the Phoenxix New Times for a chance to win tickets.  Ive been here 4 times and have yet to pay to get in.Upon walking in I was surprised at how big it is. There were only 2 others in the restaurant. It was an off time. The place is very clean. It was very warm inside. Which was not pleasant on an over 100 degree day. 
I was ordering take out.  The order process was quick and simple. 
It took about 20 minutes for the order to be ready. They also include napkins and utensils. 
I ordered the beef fajitas. It is a huge portion. Too much for one person. I was a little disappointed as I felt it was overwhelmed by cilantro. The tortillas had an odd flavor as well. 
The chips were good, not greasy nice flavor. 
The beans were quite watery. The rice was perfectly cooked and I liked the taste. Perfectly seasoned. 
I ordered the shrimp burrito for my DH and he loved it. 
I found the prices high. 32.00 for two for takeout. 
I will try this place again, they had a lot of choices.While the VIP cabana was awesome, the service was eh.  The waitress completely messed up our bill that is my drink was on someone else's bill, someone else's food was on another person's bill, etc.  It would have been better if we would have all paid cash and didn't let her make a tab, which she fubar'ed anyway.

We were all charged an automatic 20% tip, which given that it took so long to settle the bill (40 minutes), was annoying to say the least.  She misquoted a drink to my friend, but I did not hear her tell her that it was a misquote later, but offered her the reduced price.  Thus, when I ordered the same drink and stated the price of it (i.e. I want that ten dollar drink special that she has), I was unpleasantly surprised to find it was $5 more.  I wasn't trying to get one over on her or anything, but she could have easily corrected me and I would have choosen a different drink.     

Honestly, I would go again, but I would not spend nearly as much on food and drink.  Not worth it.Fast food Chinese place at a reasonable price.

I will start off with the cons:
1.  The hot & sour soup was missing flavor.
2.  The duck was rough and did not have the quality taste I was looking for.

The pros:
1.  Great deal!
2.  Competitive with more selection compared to Panda Express.

If you are looking for a bit more selection and competitive price, go here rather than Panda Express.  But that is just about it.  We may see you again, because my in-laws live near you and they do like you.When I moved to Vegas the Feast Buffet at Boulder Station was my very first Vegas casino buffet. While it was my first, it's not my current favorite as there are other contenders for that crown, but they also come with a much higher price tag. But when you want a solid buffet with Asian, Italian, and other ethnic options and live action stations from meat carving to Asian prep...you can't go wrong by coming here. 

My last visit was for Thanksgiving as it was a reminder of how far we had come since moving here. While this year this food was not quite as good, "they didn't have pumpkin raviolis this time", the turkey and ham was perfect, the prime rib vanished, and their banana creme pie was really good. 

One thing I really dislike is they charged FULL PRICE for a soon to be 3 year old. Seriously, $15 for Thanksgiving for a 2 year old, and we got some attitude from the cashiers to boot? No, I don't think so. I'm going to squawk about that. And rather than talk to a powerless manager, let me use my trusty Yelp bullhorn to say I think the pricing for kids sucks. 

I would give 4 Stars, but the outright fleecing over the kids pricing rips one star completely out of consideration.I'm not going to into too much detail on this review, but I will say you get what you pay for.  I will say the Tempe location was a huge improvement from the Scottsdale location, but still not a place I would frequent.  I did get a decent wax for the price, but the "technician" was barely of age, and obviously very new to the waxing business.  There were several areas missed and some of the techniques used were a bit odd compared to what I am used to.  On the plus side, they did get me in the same day, and the price was significantly below what I am used to paying for a Brazilian.  I would prefer to spend an extra $20 and make an appointment in advance with my esthetician, but in a bind I would probably go back... I just won't expect miracles for $40!It's vehicle emissions.  They all seem to use basically the same system, so it takes about the same amount of time no matter where you go.  The only real variable is how busy they are.  If it's 5-10 minutes per car, as I would estimate, you can get an idea how long you'll be waiting by how far back in line you are.  I've had to wait here for half an hour or more, and sometimes as little as 5 minutes.  This visit was 5 minutes.

The crew was pleasant, efficient, and got me out reasonably quickly.  Apparently they now take credit (this is new to me), but probably a good idea to have cash in case there is a problem with the credit card.it's seems like medium means well done here so make your self clear!Have yet to try anything else on the menu.  But their Italian Cheesesteak Sandwich is pretty good. When I ordered it to go the 1st time, my boyfriend ate the half I had left over and he liked it.  However as I'm sitting here eating the sandwich, I realized there was hardly any steak in it this time around. Minus a star for that.  Liked the fact that the restaurant had the old school pizza parlor feel to it, with the white and red checkered table covers.Most people love their hamburgers but I am a fan of their hot dogs!

Their regular burger is pretty tasty and is a double patty. Their small burger is one patty and definitely enough for me.

I love the fact that you can put all kinds of toppings for no extra charge. It really gives you an opportunity to experiment with different toppings every time you go. 

However, the pricing is a little on the expensive side for being hamburgers and hotdogs. Not too expensive....just like 10.00-12.00 for a "combo" as they sell things separately.

Overall, once in a while I crave it and do end up coming back.This place is highly OK. If you need food for lunch, it'll get the job done, but it's nothing special. 

I had the tuna, my dad had the Reuben. The Reuben was a bit weird as it didn't have dressing, just corned beef, kraut, and Swiss. 

The big thing though was the bread. I used to live in SF and this isn't really close to SF sourdough. It's pretty flat and if you're going to name the restaurant after the bread it better be pretty darn good. 

I should also point out that if a restaurant is going to invoke SF, using styrofoam plates is a little incongruent, not to mention that it didn't look like there was a recycling bin for drink bottles. 

So yeah, this place is fine, but it's definitely not worthy of the four stars it had when I went.Comfortable, loungie atmosphere inside with a nice patio outside on the 2nd level of a building at Southbridge in downtown Scottsdale. There was live music the night I was there. If you sit at the bar, you order your drink off of an Ipad. In my opinion, this is very impersonal. I couldn't request a certain drink off the ipad either, so we waited to order from the bartender. He was super busy and when he finally took the time to talk to us, he didn't seem enthusiastic about making a drink that wasn't on the menu.  In the end, my drink did turn out pretty good (some mixed whiskey drink), but that's not the only reason I go to a fancy bar. I expected a friendly bartender ready to bestow some mixology wisdom on me! This didn't happen. I recommend going during happy hour, if they have one. The drinks are very expensive.3 1/2 stars.

Not a bad place for ramen considering we folks here in Las Vegas are severely limited with authentic ramen choices.  Call me old school, but I still have the idea the best ramen joints ever are the ones where it's a huge hole-in-the-wall.  Not catering to anyone, but being able to knock your socks off with a simple bowl of noodles and broth.

I hate to say it but Anime Ramen is a bit gimmicky for my tastes.  Sure, I guess it's cool to have little Asian girls trot around in their form-fitting cosplay outfits, and have various anime posters all around.  But for me it takes away from the experience of a true bowl of ramen.  Ramen to folks in Japan is simple, comforting, and in many ways an art form.  The ingredients used to make your broth, the way you make your noodles so they have the right chew, and the additions you add to your bowl are supposed to evoke zen-like feelings when all is done correctly.  Well, that's what I hear anyway.  The environment at Anime Ramen just kinda distracts me from trying to enjoy my bowl of ramen!  

I'll give the cosplay girls credit though, they do a good job with service.  Attentive, kind, and pretty on point.  No complaints there.  But the food just didn't leave any kind of lasting impression on me.  It was ok, nothing special to me.

I tried the shoyu ramen that night.  For $8 I thought it was a bit on the skimpy side, the bowl was small!  I really wish there was more noodles for me to slurp up.  The broth was rather bland for my tastes.  I didn't get much of a shoyu flavor, or a deep broth flavor of any kind for that matter so it left me a bit disappointed.  I added extra soy sauce to the bowl and it tasted a bit better but still not good enough.  Maybe the broth could have used more beef or pork bones?  Perhaps more bonito?  Or maybe even a dash of MSG?  I dunno, it just wasn't that great for me.

I also tried the teriyaki chicken rice plate.  That was ok too, not the best teriyaki but not the worst.  Chicken was on the small size of portions (I am over 200 pounds people!), but at least the rice was good and the veggies were cooked just right.  

There are other things to try on their little menu, various other ramen bowls, teriyaki dishes, a few salads, and appetizers including teri sliders and furikake fries which I've heard are very good.  And nothing over the menu is $10 or so.  Value wise it sounds good, but man do those portions seem small!  This place is great for you lighter eaters.

Me thinks that you are unfortunately paying for the anime-themed ambiance.  I place way more stock in the quality, quantity and taste of your food.  Size matters!There's a lot to love about Bread and Butter but I can see why some are saying they fall short. It's a cool little spot that offers some pretty unique items. The service wasn't terrible but they are slow. After about 15 minutes of waiting, a lady, I'm assuming a manager came out and asked if we'd been waiting long. That was nice but it wasn't very busy and it still took about 25 minutes to get our food. 

My biggest problem is with their descriptions of what they offer...or lack thereof. I ordered the waffle sandwich with chicken and had I not been on Yelp, I would have never known it was smothered in gravy. My wife ordered a ham and cheese that had some type of horseradish sauce on it. Neither of those things were mentioned because there's no description for any of the food on the TV menus. Not only that, but nothing in the pastry counter is labeled either. The pastry display was also pretty bare with not much to choose from and this was just before noon.

The food itself was good but nothing that amazed us. They have a decent waffle and I really liked the rosemary gravy. I wasn't a fan of the chicken on my sandwich though. I'm not sure why they use shredded chicken as it lacked flavor completely and did nothing for the dish. I'd opt for the ham if we ever went back. My wife's sandwich was good but pretty skimpy on the ham for a $10 sandwich. We also ordered a red velvet whoopie pie that was delicious and we devoured it but way overpriced at $6! 

If you're in the area, it might be worth the stop for a treat. But the food wasn't anything out of this world, especially when you consider the price and their service is slow. I'd like to try one of the cronuts that seem so popular but I definitely wouldn't go out of my way to come back.Finally went to Dominick's...  I love steak houses... So I was overdue for a visit.

Ambiance: awesome. No other word (perfect if you want a romantic date or out with close friends).

Service: outstanding.  They knew the menu, timing, etc.  anticipated my need for black napkin, never had an empty drink, extremely polite and prompt without hovering.

Food: fine.  The beet salad was delicious.  The steak was fine... But over-cooked (ordered med rare... Got medium).   Side dishes were fine... But nothing outstanding.  I tasted my friend's pork chop which was very good.

Overall, I expected the food to be better for the high prices.  But I enjoyed the ambiance and service very much.Two friends and I decided to try this place out for St. Patrick's Day, since it's an American fare restaurant and bar they were not charging a cover charge to get in. We did not make reservations which if you decide to try this place out for any holiday or special occasion, I will strongly suggest that you do. We waited an hour to be seated, which wasn't bad for as many people as were there.
   Once we were seated the service was great! I really wanted to eat something Irish and I was able to from their special St. Paddy's Day menu. I ordered the Irish Sheppard's Pie. It wasn't bad for an American restaurant and of course I had to get a drink which was the St. Paddy's Girl made with Jameson's Whiskey, Bailey's Irish Cream and  cold coffee and was rimmed with chocolate. This drink was delicious! A friend ordered Corned Beef and Cabbage which they served to her cold (not very cool) that got sent back and to make up for it the Manager let her order anything off the menu and gave her the dinner free without her even having to say anything. As soon as the dish was sent back the Manager was at our table to apologize. . The service and atmosphere of the place along with the live bands made the decision to go here a good one. I will definitely return!I am a fan for their breakfast  great stuff and super good deals. 

You can get eggs hashbrowns toast for about 3.00 and if you want to add bacon its about 75 cents more. 

Their coffe is great and they have homemade bagels all kinds that are super yummy. 

As far as lunch goes Im not the biggest fan.

The people who work there are super nice and I have never got bad service.After a long 3rd day at CES (Consumer Electronics Show) in Vegas, my company and I indulged ourselves with some Brazillian AYCE steakhouse meats. I made reservations and we came in as a large party. The staff was very accommodating and led us to a big table.

After some wine, everyone headed to the salad bar except me. I wanted to start with the meat!! Way to be unique right? So there I was by myself at this huge table eating an outrageous amount of meat. Unfortunately, I got sick of the meat fast. It was good and all but I think I just wasn't in the mood for that much meat. I flipped over my card and headed to the salad bar afterwards.

The salad bar was decent and had a good amount of food to choose from but similar to the meat, nothing really stood to me. I loaded my plate with a couple of items and headed back. 

Dessert, on the other hand, was delicious and very nicely served in a fancy glass topped with a beautiful flower. Of course we stuck the flower in someone's ear and instagramed a photo.

Nice place overall, but I didn't feel as though it was anything extraordinary. It may have been my appetite that day so I have to give it a second try one of these days.

*** 3.5 stars rounded down this time for the lack of wow factor.Love the location but wish our experience was better, we just come here for the atmosphere and enjoy the company of our friends. Wish they would watch Bar Rescue on the food network and learn. We will return but with my expectations lowered. Fish and Chips where soggy, only two small fillets and saturated in oil, fries where soggy. :(  The 3 taco app. was great! Karaoke was fun on Friday night!!the massage was good, not great but very good.  the experience starts off wrong however since when I showed up with my Yelp deal in hand they showed me that the every day deal is the $38 massage reduced to $20 so when I bought the special deal, it really was the every day deal at the store.

Outside of that it was a nice hour.Decent breakfast fare. Really wish they had real hash browns and not frozen potatoes and hash brown patties...Try the bacon and avocado omelette and add green chiles and you won't be disappointed!Wide disparity in quality and appearance throughout the complex and its facilities. Many of the maintenance requests I made at time of move-in have not been completed and management seems evasive about fixing the garage door I am renting, which is so smashed in that there are big gaping holes between the folding panels. The carpeting was so old and worn that even though it had been cleaned, within 30 days it looked like it was very dirty and way past when it should have been replaced. All the appliances are VERY low efficiency cheap poor quality, which appears to be because since tenants pay for their own utilities, why pay more for efficiency. Although the management team has treated me very well with much courtesy and assistance when asked (which is why 3 stars instead of 1), the facility's maintenance crew is woefully unresponsive and seems to be holding the complex's infrastructure together with bailing wire and duct tape.I've been here twice and I am going to start going more often...

So, I am updating from 4 to 3 stars and seeing Underworld can earn 1 or 2 more.

Pros: It is a fun place, well decorated, with a great sound system and hosting cool events... such as the Wednesday Late Night KILL OR BE KILLED Comedy Show and cool local music.

Cons: Uninspired selection, unfriendly service and prices that change depending on who you order from.

Check it out for yourself and give it a chance.
It can be a great pace and I'm sure it will do well with a bit of TLC.I really wanted to love this place. We stopped in on a Thursday for our first try of this promising restaurant and were wowed by the decor. The restaurant was pretty full and we were excited to try out the menu. We were there around 6:30pm and the menu states that Happy Hour goes from 4-7--yippee!  Alas, our waitress told us that the menu was old and that happy hour only goes until 6 now. Ok. Well, water for us. :(

We decided to go forward and try the German soft pretzels and cheese curds. The cheese curds were very good with a light tasty coating. The soft pretzels had very little flavor. They were saved by a tasty beer cheese sauce that was offered as a side. We then chose to order a Craftsman Burger with the sweet potato fries. The burger was ok. Not great. Not awful. Better burger is found at Hubbard Avenue Diner. The sweet potato fries were very fresh, but sadly lacked seasoning. So disappointing. We cut our loses at that point and didn't stay for dessert. We won't be back. There are plenty of better restaurants in the area.This review is for dinner service. I pretended I didn't know Chinese and I was treated very differently. 

There is a Chinese menu, only given to those who ask. Otherwise an English menu is provided. 

We chose the walnut shrimp and the chow fun without gravy. Very small portions and guess what your dish doesn't come with rice .  I have never been to a restaurant where your dinner entree doesn't come with rice. Make sure you order that! 

Food pics attached . 4 star for food and 1 star for service, waiters treat you different if you don't speak Chinese! Learn it before you come!Good Pizza. Went at about 3pm, no crowd.  Right across from US Airways Arena and a few blocks from Chase Field.**3.5 stars**

Pita Pit was a great find as I was in search of a healthy bite to eat.  

We were greeted by a very friendly gentleman at the counter.  He took our order and began making a couple of people's order.  When he got to ours, he calls you over and asked you specifically what you want on your pita, love that customization!  My veggie pita was good and all ingredients were fresh, at least on my pita.  My husband had the gyro which the meat is frozen and is then cooked on the grill to order.   

Prices are reasonable, parking was easy, service was friendly, food was good!This place isn't so bad. Open til the wee morning hours which makes this place popular. I came here with my mom and ordered the lobster which came out very nice.

All HK food is the same to me, but the service is nice and things were fairly clean. I'd come back only if someone else wanted to but not on my own preference.We did the Whisky Tour cause it's kinda the tourist thing to do and we... eh.... were tourists.  Having said that, it was somewhat enjoyable.  We were a little surprised at the little wine barrel ride, thinking somehow we were back at home in adult Disney or something, but like another reviewer said, it was welcoming since we've been walking alllll day long and it was a chance to rest our legs.

I've never tried whisky before... so it's a new experience and to be honest, I didn't like it.  But I think it must be an acquired taste and didn't expect to fall in love with it right away.  The tour itself was pretty decent.  The whisky tasting was cool because the tour guide provides you with the basic information and introducing you to whisky from different regions.  The whisky collection room was pretty impressive.

So, I wouldn't exactly put it as highlight of my trip.  I think it's a neat thing to do if you have a few extra days in Edinburgh and have toured the castle, the royal mile, Arthur's Seat etc.... and looking for something more to do.  Or if you simply love whisky and/or wanted to learn/try more.  Otherwise, it's far down the priority list for me.3 stars only because the fish tacos were to DIE for!!  

For the 4th of July, my boss and his wife hired this food truck to feed us all for our annual holiday party.  I thought the idea was superb and the women running it were so sweet.  My fiance and I tried the fish tacos with black beans and rice as well as the fried chicken smothered in gravy with mac n' cheese.  As I stated before, the fish tacos were amazing.  I'm not a fan of hot sauce so she suggested adding a sweet chili sauce, and it was spot on.  The black beans and rice were just that and nothing more...bland to say the least.  The chicken was good but the gravy really took away the crispiness and we were left wishing we'd done without it.  The mac n' cheese tasted fine but was SOOOOO greasy it was unappealing.  There are ways of doing great mac without giving people a heart attack.  

I wouldn't go out of my way to eat from here again but I will tip my hat for those tacos!One of my coworkers suggested a girls' lunch here in May.  This place is located just inside the Phoenix Art Museum (which I didn't know had a cafe).  You don't have to pay admission - just tell one of the museum employees that you're just visiting the cafe and they'll give you a special colored sticker.

The cafe is cute and open with lots of windows.  I ordered the the quinoa salad and the grilled cheese and they were wonderful.  The quinoa salad is cold which I didn't expect but it paired well with the grilled cheese.  Expect to pay $20 for lunch because the ingredients are local and natural.    The food was excellent but I will probably only come here once in a while due to the price.The name is apt. Once you manage to manuever yourself through a ridiculously long line and get inside, this place is totally like a CORRAL. A herd of hungry people, food on the floor, food on the tables, lines for MORE food. Don't expect a peaceful meal. This place doesn't cater to that. Cheap prices and plentiful food. No wonder Golden Corral opened up near Rowland Heights. Asians love these gimmicks! =P

And with all that being said, the food quality here was good and the desserts were very plentiful. Not your standard buffet desserts. 

Steak, sausages chicken etc. All the poultry and seafood (fish and shrimp)  were pretty fresh. The fried shrimps were huge! The breads were great too. I didn't want to fill up on those, but the cheese biscuits and the corn bread was delish. Dessert! Pies, cupcakes (red velvet!), bread pudding, chocolate fountain, cotton candy, ice cream, soft serve, whoa.... And the workers kept pumping these out. Fresh. 

My only real complaint is the layout. The station with all the meats (the most popular) was right by the entry way where people were paying and waiting for their dining tables. Sooo crowded with the lines and the people walking through. There really should be more room. Especially if people are carrying plates of hot food. 

Save your calories and drink water. I think you can ask your server for a glass of water once you reach the table. Golden Corral tries to lure you to purchase a drink since the drink dispensers are right next to the cashiers. I got the sweet tea. And it was sooo watered down. Drinks are $ 2.50 and is added on top of your dinner price.

Definitely got bang for my buck here. $10.50 for an adult at dinner (not including drink)! Service was nice and helpful. Even with the chaotic environment.Customer service at this place is ALWAYS hit or miss. The sales associate that we had this time told us that Guitar Center has new management and that they are now trying to build their customer relationships. We shall see about that. Only time will tell.I usually don't eat here often, only when my relatives want Filipino food & just forced to tag along. & You know what's sad? I think they have WAY better pho here compared to Jenni Pho & Pho Annie. Seriously, try the pho if you're not  into their Filipino food lol. 

The only Filipino food I love more than anything is beefsteak & theirs is good. Not the best but it is good. I also tried the avocado boba & I was not expecting the "smoothie" ice to be so coarsely grounded. But the flavor was good, I just wish they blended it into finer ice. The food here overall is just decent. Service is never on top though. Some days the service will be OK, & some days you'll get a rude server. 

I won't eat here unless I'm forced to & you're paying & I will only order pho.I had my blood drawn here for an allergy test recently. The lady behind the counter was ok. She was pretty ambivalent towards me, although very efficient and barely left a bruise. (I bruise easily) I'm terrible at getting my blood drawn, so I always appreciate when the technician is quick. I sometimes faint when I get blood drawn, and when I told her this she said ok. I thought it was a little weird that she left me alone to get out of the chair on my own. I was fine, so it wasn't an issue. 

This location is close to downtown and open until 6pm which is later that a lot of the other locations. There was only one person a head of me, so I was in and out rather quickly.Not overly impressed.  I should have known it would be a zoo on Saturday afternoon.  Everything they  stock is in large quantities so they need lots of customers to turn stuff over.  Most of their prices are pretty good but they have a couple of high prices hidden in there like a bottle of wine that goes for around $6.50 at Walmart priced at almost $10.  A couple of things they do not stock that were on my list: medium sized noodles and garbanzo beans (not in bulk either).  The conveyors at the registers are still not working so checkout is more of a hassle than it needs to be.  I doubt if I will go often as it is not a place that is easy to slip in and get a few things and get out.Used to shop here when I lived in the Foothills. 

Super convenient location for those times you don't want to make the trip to the Safeway and Fry's Marketplace on Chandler and 40th just for one can of chicken stock, spices, etc.  

Starbucks inside . . . cha-ching! 

The selection is a bit limited, but this seems to be a smaller Safeway so that's to be expected. 

Can't stress enough how friendly the staff is, especially one of the managers. He'd always remember your name and what you may have chatted about previously while bagging your groceries. Sad that I'm drawing a blank on his name, because he's a cool dude and deserves props!We we leaving for a trip to San Francisco in the late afternoon, so we decided to grab a bite to eat. We were pleasantly surprised to see this restaurant right across from Paradise Bakery in Terminal 4. They certainly are giving PB a run for their money.

Everything was almost the same as their other restaurant in Scottsdale. When our pizza came , the dough, was sitting in some of the sauce. I prefer the bottom of my pizza to be dry. 

We are not discouraged, we'll be back.Friendly staff and Coffee was great!!! Food was good, nothing out of the ordinary. I had biscuits and gravy.  Biscuits were very good and fresh and gravy was tasty.  Everything was good until the place filled up and kitchen got busy.  You could hear the pots and pans banging, waiters talking, well place got extremly loud!! But I guess that happens with small restaurants. I think next time I'll just have take our instead.Yes, the imperial cake I tried was delicious and the chocolate fountain was cool...but my experience here was marred by the horrible staff members behind the counter.  I had trekked my butt miles across the strip to find this place and the 4-6 people working would stare at me annoyed, and carry on talking amongst themselves.  There was one person who had already ordered ahead of me so I don't know what the hold up was.  I used to be a pastry chef myself so I totally appreciate the beautiful art/desserts, but they need to hire people who actually care about what Jean Phillippe is all about and are excited to share his craft.  I'd love to go back but might be tempted to head towards Max Brenner or another patisserie.The food here is awesome--I'd give five stars for that. I got the chopped southwest salad and it was great. The fries, burgers, and sandwiches that my family got were also good.

I had two issues here though. The first was the smoking. Seriously, at least the patio area is like sitting in a cigarette and it was disgusting. I'm not sure if it is non-smoking indoors.. at this point I thought non-smoking was a law so I didn't even think to be ask to be seated in a non-smoking section. They should probably mention that the seating area is smoking since that is not the norm anywhere else anymore.

Second issue was the service initially. We waited about five minutes to have our drink order taken and then waited for ten minutes, drink-less, until the manager arrived and apologized. After that the service was fine. Our new waiter seemed super rushed and brisk, but the place was crowded so I guess it was okay. It just was kind of stressful the way he was rushing around. The manager was super nice though and checked in a few times to make sure everything was okay. So I feel like they were aware of the service issue and did their best.

So yea overall, awesome food.. gross smoke.. maybe I'll see if they offer to-go? Otherwise I think I'd spare my lungs.While the decor is unique & fun, and the names of the dishes are playful & young, overall it wasn't someplace where I left saying "wow, I want to go back again!!"I admit to being confused by the review posted before mine:  to compare this place to the Golden Greek is like comparing McDonald's to the Russian Tea Room!  Granted, they both serve Greek food; but no matter what your opinion about the Golden Greek  (and mine isn't good:  see my review of them!), this place is, like most "Greek" places in the Valley, a pseudo-fast food restaurant, while the Golden Greek serves actual meals.

I also don't get the line about the pita bread:  the pita bread here is of the cheapest sort:  fluffy and thick.  You may like that; but "real" pita bread is like the ones served at the Golden Greek and Haji Baba's (for example):  thin and doughy.  Prices are fair?  Yeah, that's about right ... "fair" as in on a scale from "bad" to "excellent":  the appetizers (hummus, babaganouj, dolmas, etc.) are priced fairly in comparison to other places, but that doesn't mean they're good:  $6+ for a "large" appetizer, which, while "wide" on the plate is not deep, is not "fair".  I won't even bother talking about the dolmas, because NOWHERE is that a good deal; it's a top money maker for all Mediterranean restaurants:  5 or 6 dolmas for $ 5.00, when you can get a large can of about 60 or more for the same price  (try the market at Baiz or Haji Baba).  

Now the taste:  the hummus was interesting.  Tasty and with a touch of cayenne pepper.  Very unusual for hummus, but, you know what?  It worked:  definitely wiped out any expected blandness, but was not strong enough to overpower.  Good job there.

The babaganouj was strange.  Again:  tasted good.  But it wasn't very "smoky" and the consistency was almost buttery.  Both traits very uncommon for this dish.

The dolmas were excellent, but obviously straight out of the can.  Thankfully, very firm (just the way I like them).

The Greek salad was good, but nothing spectacular.  For a fast food place like this  --- and yes, I'm sorry:  I would classify this as a "fast food" joint --- it was especially good.

My partner said the chicken shwarma was good, but he was glad he had sides, because it wouldn't have come close to being enough for him by itself  (then again, if any of you have read my reviews, you know already that his athletically muscular build hides an enormous appetite ... one day, we went to a buffet and Godzilla was impressed with how much he ate! ... Pretty bad, when you can outeat a Japanese dinosaur).

Decor in the restaurant is nice, though, when it's crowded, it's quite noisy:  my loss, but obviously their gain ... they're not there to run an empty joint.  Seating, however, is VERY limited:  we saw two families open the door and leave shortly afterwards:  there's only 6 booths and 2 tables, so it doesn't take a lot of people to fill it.

Overall, if you have a craving for Mediterranean food and are willing to not expect a whole lot, then this place is more than acceptable.  But it in no way compares to the Golden Greek or any other "real" restaurant, regardless of whether the food is better or not.We usually eat breakfast at Egg & I but deciding to try this place.What lured us in were the pic of the beignets which we found out are actually no longer on the menu! WTF!..Talk about false advertising. ..Then what breakfast place worth its weight in gold doesn't serve freshly squeezed orange juice..Especially after a long night of dancing and drinking. THIS is essential. ..
Small yet quait with indoor/outside seating and decent decor and ambiance but who really cares about that at breakfast. ..Good food, Freshly squeezed juice options and great service is how we judge our Breakfast  spots. Whats saves this joint is The Food...fresh ingredients and righteous spicing are key..
So if you're ok with decent service, no freshly squeezed oj but good food (without the beignets)
Definitely give this place a try, at least once..I've been waiting for weeks to eat here. Even more than that, I've been waiting to mark my 5 stars and add Bacchanal to my list as the best buffet in Vegas. Unfortunately I didn't get to do any of those. There's not a lot I can say bad about this place. Overall, it was a good experience, but it wasn't the best there is. 

First of all, I parked in the garage and found it difficult to find once I was inside Caesars. There were no signs to the buffet until you're almost there. We asked four employees along the way. One person didn't have a clue. Once we got there, a long line awaited us. On a positive note, we only had to wait 25 minutes. We got there on a Monday at 10:00. I can't imagine what the wait is like on a weekend. The great thing about getting there after 10 is that they start changing the food line at 11. You get the end of breakfast and the beginning of lunch. Hmmm...I believe that is called brunch. Oh....there is a big price difference between breakfast and lunch. 

The facility is beautiful. It is large enough to walk between tables without disturbing others. Yelpers comment about how expensive it is, but I think it is well worth the money. The food was very good. I was stuffed when I left. For breakfast I had bacon (greasy and fatty), red velvet pancakes (just OK), sweet potato tots (scrumptious), biscuit (OK), scrambled eggs (runny), shrimp and grits (OK). I tasted my partner's french toast and it was very good. 

For lunch I had dim sum (all that I tried was very good), paella (good and an unusual dish for a buffet), BBQ spare ribs (smoky). I didn't bother waiting in line for the very small salad bar. I tasted my partner's very good fried chicken. There were a lot of food choices and the food was a little above average for a buffet. There were no signature dishes that would be unique to Bacchanal such as some of the dishes you will find at the Wicked Spoon. Actually, the way that the food was displayed and served makes you think that the designers spent a lot of time checking out the Wicked Spoon as they were designing this place. Unfortunately, they didn't bring over the chefs.

Lastly...the desserts. I only had the red velvet cake and carrot cake. They were both very good. I usually hate the nasty carrot cakes at buffets, but the bakery stepped up to the plate and hit a home run with the carrot cake. My friends had different desserts and said that they were all fabulous. The coffee was good. 

I don't like to do buffets because I tend to overeat. I can't imagine that I would ever go back to to this one unless I was with someone that insisted upon going there. I'd much rather go the the M or the Wicked Spoon.It's a fun place, good atmosphere but that's all.  There's a wide selection of food but most of it wasn't really good.  I could go again but next time to eat the seafood only.  I wasn't too impressed for the $50 price I had to pay for the dinner buffet. This makes for a good lunch spot tho.  It seemed like the beef and lamb chops were sitting out all day, which they most likely were as in most buffets.  The sushi was dry and had absolutely no flavor at all.  I give it an average rating.This Buffet was very good the design inside was amazing i love the look of the different sections. I only give it 3 stars because overall the food was good it didn't WOW me. But for the dessert section the sweets were amazing i probably tried everything there...it was so yummy. 

I would come back again but i just feel this buffet is overpriced.It was voted the #1 buffet in Vegas by USA Today.  Intrigued by this honor and ready to overindulge Vegas style, we skipped breakfast and headed over for a late lunch.

There are many stations:  Fresh Seafood, American BBQ, Mexican, Italian, and Asian.

The oysters were fresh and the jumbo shrimp was not overly cooked.  The cocktail sauce had a nice kick from the horseradish.  Off to a good start!

The prime rib was overcooked; even the rarest piece was medium-well at best.  

The meatball was tasty and not filled with breadcrumbs.  The pizzas had a nice crust and were satisfying.

Step away from the Asian selection.  An interesting amalgamation of Chinese, Thai and  Japanese.  The chow fun was dry, the sushi was what you'd expect at a buffet but the selection (only 3 kinds) was disappointing.  The char sui bao filling was yummy but the bread was hard and the har gow was gummy.

All in all, just okay.  Buffet includes soft drinks, tea and juice.  Price is steep, but Vegas is not cheap.  And, if you make it your only meal you come out ahead.I read pretty good reviews about this place and was so excited to try it when we arrived in Vegas this past Saturday.  After we checked in at our hotel, this was our first stop.  When we got to the outside of the buffet, we walked straight to this lady who was standing at the podium.  She told us that we had to get a ticket from one of the ticket machines and it'll tell us when to come back for our table.  Well, they should post instructions for people who are new to this buffet.  Everyone was so confused and she had to tell all of them to get a ticket.  When we received a text to come back for our table, the same lady at the podium told us to come back in another 15 minutes.  At that moment, I was starting to get a little aggravated since I was starving.  When we finally got our table, we went straight to the food.  We got pretty much of everything (dim sum, sushi, Chinese food, fruit, pizza, crabs, clam chowder, juice, ham, lamb, clam chowder, chicken in green chilies, Mexican rice, waffle fries, baked potato, macaroni and cheese, maple glazed tator tots, miso seabass and desserts).  Everything was just ok.  There was nothing special about the food.  The dim sum had really thick wrappers.  The lamb was dry.  The seabass, clam chowder and crabs were too salty.  The rice on the sushi and Mexican rice was crunchy in texture.  It seemed like the rice was not fully cooked.  The presentations for the desserts were great, but the flavors were just the opposite.  The only items I enjoyed were the macaroni and cheese, baked potato and the mango juice.  There's a lot of food choices there, but I didn't think I saw 500 items from what I read online.  Our waiter was super nice but I don't think I'll ever come back for the food.Five stars for the environment. It makes me just want to sit there and chat with friend even if I am not eating anymore. 

Three stars for the food. Most of the food looked very appetizing, until you eat it.
I got five cold crab legs, three of them are way too salty that I couldn't eat them. 
BBQ rib needs a little bit more time
Fresh oyster did not taste too fresh and was a little sandy

Must try - the oxtail soup - five stars

Also, their Asian food were not bad either. They even had ramen!

For $50, I don't know if I should come back again...Came here for dinner tonight with my hubby.  We are from Las Vegas visiting family for the holidays. After eating left over foods, my husband and I craved for something different.  It was quite hard to find a restaurant that is still open at 9:30pm.  Luckily, I found Thai Basil in Yelp and called them.  Although they closed at 10pm, we did not feel rushed at all.  We got there at 9:54pm and the lady that waited us still had a smile on her face and asked for our order politely.  That is where the extra star is from.

We ordered Tofu Panang, Tom Kha and BBQ Chicken.  I was a little disappointed with my tofu panang as it did not have enough tofu in it and the tofu was not fried.  The Tom Kha was ok nothing special to it.  I've had better.  The Jasmine tea was excellent, perfect for the cold weather.  The chicken BBQ was the most disappointing of all.  For $10, they served 3 small pieces of chicken breast on a bed of a bunch of cabbage with sweet chili sauce.  My husband was so disappointed!!  The taste was ok nothing special but if I knew that we are only getting 3 small pieces for 10 bucks, we wouldn't have ordered it.  Their thai tea was good according to my husband.

The 3 stars is definitely for the service and the late night availability.  The food is not all that and they are quite pricey for the amount of food that they are serving.  If we ever go back, we will definitely not order the bbq chicken and tofu panang.  I think I will try different place before I come back here.Great place to get a quick bite to eat before your flight.This review is more about the service than the Food. I had the food here once before and it was fantastic. So when my friend came in from Denver, I said yes, let's meet here ,the food is great!
Well, the food was great! Awesome for me. I got the Brussels sprout salad,which has a touch of bacon. $14.00, Very good but, very high priced even for the Airport.
My friend got a burger that came with fries. For $13.00 that was a bit high I thought.
The bun completely fell apart, & we don't know why. However, the food is very good, so that is not the issue.
The issue was our server.
She was the absolute worst!!
 Everyone else is happy in here, taking good care of their customers and really working hard. We had to get the one that did not want to be there, that did not have any idea what was going on in the restaurant at all.
Our server was Imelda, She may of been having a really bad day, or just completely uncaring about her job.
 We waited about 20 min for our food. Which of course this is a sit down place, so I am not complaining about that at all.
However, In over an hour in the place we were never offered a refill on our tea. I had hot , she had Iced. Our food was brought out to us, she never asked , do you need anything else, how is everything, something more, a refill, dessert...Nothing. when she did a drive by to throw the check on the table, I was able to ask for a Take Away container for my friend. Which she did bring to us.
But, really it was a horrible experience with Imelda.
I would watch her walk around not really doing anything, just stroking her hair.
I wondered why she did not check on us. It was 2:30 in the afternoon she was not even busy.

The place is decorated very nicely. With a nice faux fireplace which I think is really nice and relaxing.
I really wanted to have a nice time here, I told my friend from Denver that she was going to love the food here.
Maybe we will try it again. But, I will be sure to get a different server.
The hostesses were sweet and friendly.They are trying hard. And I wish them well. Fish needs to be fresher. Guess I'm spoiled living in Hawaii...Pretty incredible for airport food.Javier's in California gets 5 stars! I'm new to Vegas and really miss it but this one wasn't the same. I will try it again some day. I'm glad the chips and salsa are the same.Popped in for lunch after a little AM yoga sesh today.  Had been by after my initial trip to Union on opening day - they weren't open when I was there then.  Weirdly, at 11:45 today half the stores in Union were open, half weren't.  Anyway, TDP is super cute.  Love the tables, love the outdoor seating and the small bar.  The staff was super friendly and helpful with our orders.  I could really taste the olive oil on my sandwich and the bread was nice. 

Overall, the food was good, but not great and definitely overpriced. $9 for a Caprese sandwich is ridiculous - and the tomato on this one wasn't ripe.    The meatball sandwich needed more sauce.  The chicken salad sandwich looked great, but again, for such small sandwiches I would expect fruit or salad or something.

I think next time I'll just enjoy the free smells, and buy a bottle of delicious olive oil from their store across the way.This place looks like what would happen if you were forced to decorate a bar with what was left behind after someone robbed the Duluth, MN Hard Rock Cafe. It's a cross between a Spencer's Gifts and a Zima commercial --with expensive drinks served in Dixie cups. 

I guess it's okay if you want to see who's playing... but I'm not likely to pop in otherwise.$12 for burger, fries, and soda.  Unbelievable how much some of these "nicer" fast food places charge.  Added jalapenos to my burger and it was just four little rings in the middle.  What kind of add-on topping value is that?  On top of this, the habanero cheese isn't really hot at all.  Parking is atrocious since it shares spots with Jimmy Johns and others.I have had DirecTV in the past.  Not bad, but they put you on a contract and when that contract is up, they raise the price.  Buyer beware on this.  It's in the small print.

The new Genie is nice, but honestly it's slow to respond to the remote control, Search doesn't do a good job of searching for shows, especially a month or so from when the show starts up.  Dish does a much better job at that and their unit responds quicker.

The slave units in the bedrooms or alternative locations require that the main unit be up and running.  So if you try and save electricity or you are painting the main room you still have to have this up and running or nothing works, even if you just want plain TV and don't need access to recorded programs.  When I moved the main unit to paint the wall behind, I ended up needing another tech to come out and reinstall it because it wouldn't get a good signal.  Tech came out and tried three different boxes, thinking that the unit was just bad.  After about an hour and a half of trouble shooting, the unit just magically started working.

Changing programs or removing programs requires you to call up and order or remove, unlike Dish, where you simply click on a box on the website.  No need to call in.  When you do call, the automated system can't even remove the extra programming, you still have to talk to someone, so why even have an automated system for that?  Makes no sense at all.

Signal quality....it's a scam.  It's essentially the same as Dish.  The DirecTV tech says that their signal wont be lost during the monsoons, although the last time their signal was always interrupted by the storms in the area.  So maybe they have improved since the last time.  We will wait and see.Gordon Ramsay's BurGR was a surprise to me. 
I am a fan of Chef Ramsay, and I've always been praying for him to open a restaurant here in Las Vegas. 
First there was the long anticipation of Gordon Ramsay Steak in Paris Hotel, then the big opening of Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill at Caesar's Palace, and out of nowhere Gordon Ramsay BurGR at Planet Hollywood.

I have dined at Steak in Paris hotel, and I have met Chef Ramsay at The Grand Tasting in Caesar's palace where he cooked in front of us while telling the media to go F*** themselves because he was busy cooking. And to top it all off, he personally handed me a plate of Beef Wellington which I devoured in less than .006 seconds. (It was one of the best things I've ever tasted)

But now it's time to see how a Michelin Star chef will tackle a more casual dive.

After being greeted by the hostess, you walk into this very modern restaurant where everything is bright and alive. They told me that they modeled the restaurant from Chef Ramsay's show Hell's Kitchen. I don't really know what that means, but all I know is that Ramsay's face is everywhere.
I also noticed that all the servers have a good sense of humor and are willing to go the extra mile to make you laugh and to serve, of course.

The server hands you an Ipad where you get to choose your cocktails. desserts, and/or  the restaurant's huge selection of imported beers. We skipped the alcohol  and immediately checked out the desserts, and ended up ordering a Shake #5 (hazelnut pudding and coffee shake topped with a praline cookie)

We Started our meal with the Fury Chicken Wings, Roasted Jalapeno Poppers, and Five Spice Chicken Sliders.
The Wings come with 4 pieces of "tangy hellfire blue cheese wings", (which tasted like regular buffalo wings with just a little hint of lime) and 4 Honey-wasabi wings (which was color green, and tasted sweet with an aromatic wasabi after-taste, we found it very delightful)
The Jalapeno Poppers were really interesting. They serve you 6 Jalapeno poppers, each of them inside a shot glass filled 1/4 way with house ranch. 
After I took my first bite, I was surprised how spicy the jalapenos were, and right away warned my girlfriend and her brother that the jalapenos are a tad spicy. They then just looked at me and laughed. After we ate all of them the server came to our table and informed us that they left the seeds in 1 of the jalapenos as a prank to the diners, which explained why my popper was spicier. It was crunchy, cheesy, and spicy! I could have gone for another order of those.
The Five Spice Chicken Sliders were just ok.. they taste exactly how they sound minus the Five Spice.
We also had an order of regular fries which came with chipotle ketchup, and curry ketchup as your dipping sauce. both were good, but the curry ketchup was a winner.

Now for the Main Course.

I work part time at a gourmet burger food truck and I've always been curious to know how our burger would stand up to Mr. Hell's Kitchen's burger. 

We ordered Their Flagship burger which was the Hell's Kitchen Burger and a Pork Belly Dawg. 
The Hell's Kitchen Burger has Mexican asadero cheese, roasted jalapeño peppers, avocado and roasted tomato. I ordered it medium well,  and the taste of this burger was a mouthful of beefy goodness. Sad to say but they kick our food truck's burger's ass. The hell's kitchen burger was both juicy and flavorful.

The Pork Belly Dawg.................. was one of the worst things I've ever put in my mouth... I can eat pork belly the whole day, I can eat Hotdogs the whole day, so when I saw this on the menu we just had to order it! 
The pork Belly comes with pickled edamame, carrots, cucumber and sriracha mayo, which honestly is not a bad combination. What destroyed the dish was the Dawg itself. One bite from this disgusting dawg and our experience was ruined. Have you ever had a spoon full of salt? That's exactly how it tastes like.

We sent back the dawg, and the server asked if we wanted something else. The manager also came to our table and explained that all the dawgs simmer in stock, so at the end of the day the stock absorbs all the flavor of the dawgs, and have "more flavor" than it's suppose to.

We exchanged our Pork Belly Dawg for an American Burger, but at this point we didn't have much of an appetite. We only took a couple of bites and ordered dessert. 

The Sticky Toffee Pudding Push Pop is a take on Chef Ramsay's Sticky Toffee Pudding Dessert at Gordon Ramsay Steak at Paris Casino. It has 2 layers of sticky pudding, and 2 layers of ice cream. It was delicious, and playful, but not as good as the real Sticky Toffee pudding.. not even close.

Summary:

-The actual menu doubles as a take-home souvinir!
-Excellent service!
-1 of the Jalapeno Poppers is rigged!
-Honey-wasabi wings are very good! (if you like wasab
-Come early or eat Salty DawgI wasn't expecting 3-Michelin-star cuisine, but I still left disappointed.

After being seated in front of a large, awkward picture of Ramsay, my family and I were presented with drink options on a fancy iPad. Whatever, not impressed.

Our orders came out quite quickly. Here's a breakdown of what I ate:

1. Truffle parmesan fries ($11) - Too salty, too thick-cut.

2. Chanterelle burger ($16) - The chanterelle mushrooms were too salty, but the patty was delicious and well-seasoned. I wish the burgers could come with fries.

3. Fish & crisp sandwich ($16) - Quite tasty.

4. Sticky toffee pudding push up pops ($7 for two) - Way too sweet. My parents were actually visibly disgusted by how sweet these were.

Service was good, but I felt bad for the waitresses who had to wear skin-tight skimpy dresses. Sure this is Vegas, but it's a little awkward having breasticles in my face every time I got my water refilled. Also, the guys' outfits looked like they were straight out of a gay bar.

All things considered, it was an okay experience that cost too much. Won't be coming back even though I'm a big fan of the chef patron.Went for the first time on Thursday June 5th for lunch around  2pm. Might have given this place 5 stars if it wasn't for the customer service. There is a great variety of burgers for everyone to chose from however our waitress killed the whole experience. She introduced herself and left her iPad on the table to look at drinks then walked away.  The table right next to us had a waiter who took the time to explain the menu and recommendations as well as helped them pick drinks from the iPad. Our food took about 15-20 min to arrive. It was perfectly cooked and the fries were perfect for sharing. When it was time to pay the waitress gave us a checkbook with an iphone built into it. Who knows what it was for since she didn't explain it and the iphone was just on the generic home page. We were paying cash and the waitress disappeared for 15 minutes so we had to waive down a waiter to take our money. Everyone around us sounded so nice and helpful we just got bad luck I guess. On our way out we ran into the waitress again who was talking with the hostess, she didn't even bother to say thank you or goodbye.I've lived in the far north valley for several years now and never knew this place existed, let alone existing in a resort that I've never heard of. 

With the exception of dessert, the food was good.  My scallops were prepared perfectly and while my lobster bisque was somewhat underseasoned, it was tasty as well.  My vanilla/strawberry cake was dry, nearly flavorless and the icing was terrible.  

Despite having a decent meal, I don't think I'll return and here's why:  Remember the ballroom scene in The Shining when Jack walks in and it's completely empty? That's how this restaurant felt.  We were the only people in there and although the restaurant was pretty inside, it faces the pool/room area which is nice enough but lacking considering it's down the street from The Boulders.  It was honestly kind of depressing.As others have said, don't go if you are in a rush. Stopped in for a smoothie and it took upwards of 20 min despite not being busy at 515 on a Tuesday. Also, the smoothie was gross. I drank a quarter of it and threw it out. Partly this is my fault because I don't drink dairy milk and I forgot to ask for almond or soy, but my smoothie was supposed to have chocolate, milk, banana, whey protein, and peanut butter. I could not taste any peanut butter and it was really watery, nothing really too it. Just ewwwwwww. Also, for a place with great vegan options they should have a protein other then whey available. The smoothie tasted like plastic butt (yes i said plastic butt) and took forever, but giving 3 stars because I like the concept and menu in general, also late hours which are great. Will not return for a smoothie or when in even the slightest rush. Also I find no bathroom for customers? Weird. Also everyone working there except the nice guy at the register seemed to be very unhappy to be there. Will give it another try and hope the food is better then drinks and service is friendlier.So my husband and I recently came here for dinner. I actually didn't mind that the restuarant is located in the Eureka Casino, it makes these local restaurants even more interesting and keeps snobs away.

We chose different items from their snacks section of the menu. We chose the potstickers, chicken wings, shrimp toast and the duck and pork belly bao. The potstickers were really good, so were the wings, although they are like wings you can get anywhere else. Maybe a ranch/sriracha sauce to accompany them would be nice. The meat on both baos was good, but we thought they could've used something moist in them. Neither my husband or I are experts on baos, we've only tried the twice, so it could be that we aren't used to them. The shrimp toast I did not understand, maybe if I would've eaten it as soon as we recived it, but by the time I tried it the egg was kind of cold. My husband really enjoyed it though, and he is picky when it comes to runny eggs. The service is very attentive and friendly, so that's a big plus. 

All in all it was a decent meal; I thought the prices were a tad bit high considering the location.I'm not gonna lie, I mean, this place wasn't half bad but there's definitely some room needed for improvement. I'll give it a few months and it'll be an amazing restaurant. But anywho, I went to the new Tempe location, it's super nice (at least from the outside), and I love that there is a drive-thru! The waitresses were really nice and quick and our food came fast so that was awesome. I had the Halibut fish sandwich. I mean, it tasted pretty average. Very similar to a Wendy's fish sandwich. On the downside, it was really messy. Way to much mayo and tartar sauce, I literally couldn't wipe it off with a napkin. But the fries and onion rings were awesome and my boyfriend loved the Italian Beef sandwich with sweet peppers and the breaded chicken on croissant. This place is really cool, I will just give it some time to get itself established :)I think my expectations of the food were set too high. Don't get me wrong, the burger was pretty damn good. Got it with everything: cheese, grilled onions, bacon & jalepeños. The last two are what made it great. Thick bacon & roasted, peeled jalapeño that was actually HOT (not for noobs). Fries were ok.
The choco-chile shake was, well, a chocolate shake with powdered chile in it. I guess an extra dollars worth. It was good but no help against the jalepeño. Luckily the waitress(?) was nice enough to refill my soda many times.
Did I mention the service? Very good, especially for a counter type setup. She even exchanged my hot salsa for mild after I tasted cumin in it (oh how I hate cumin, it kills the flavor of everything it touches). The mild was excellent, tomatoes, cilantro & chunks of garlic. If they put the jalapeños in it it would make a stellar hot salsa.
As for the short rib taco, disappointing. The meat was ok. No better than a barbacoa taco anywhere else. The pickled cabbage is a little off making the taco taste, as my daughter put it, "like taking a bite of cologne". And the dry, store bought tortilla crumbled making a mess. For $3 a taco it should be fresh-made.
All in all it was "ok". I'd come back for the burger or maybe the fresh squeezed lemonade but that's it.I love Five Guys. First time to this location and was disappointed on the large fries portion. You use to get an extra scope of fries at the bottom of the bag but I guess they don't do that anymore. You set that expectation so needless to say we were disappointed and so were other patrons as we heard their comments as well.This restaurant food was good and will improve once they have their liquor license to sell beer...because sometimes with this hot Phoenix weather a cold beer is just the perfect drink! I ordered Singapore-style rice noodles and while the food was delicious I really would have loved the meal to arrive to me piping hot. It is wonderful food but I cannot eat it fast enough so the last pieces are still warm, that's why it has to arrive to the customer piping hot. I enjoyed a pot of tea and read a magazine. There were at least 3 other groups of people enjoying their meal.Our stay at the Hard Rock was just ok.  The room was just ok.  Pink Taco was just ok.  Rehab was just ok.  Nothing that would bring me back in the future.  
The rooms are already looking worn & the paradise tower is fairly new.  We did have issues with the TV, and they did come and fix it fairly promptly.   
My previous visit to Rehab I would have given 5 stars. It is now on Saturday & Sunday, so we went on Saturday.  Just not the same fun.  Paid a good chunk for a daybed & the service was really lacking.  I guess I will stick to the smaller day clubs from now on.  The pool on Friday was ok which was probably the best part of our stay.Very good sushi and very friendly service. Excellent prices. Small dinning area and located in a strip mall, but don't let that bother you. You will certainly enjoy the food.This whole area must be built on an ancient Indian burial grounds. Every restaurant in this area is not that great.  TC's bar and grill isn't that good and nether is this place. It mus be the impossible task to have fresh food.  The French fries were old and the shrimp was slimey. Other food was  ok.  i always want to support the local owned businesses but they always seem to get lazy and sloppy over time.Did not get 2 out of 4 orders correct . Filet and stuffed shrimp , gave us shrimp and lobster Mac . Not good , fishy . May not come back . Waitress Laurie very niceI read about the restaurant in the paper and thought it would be nice to try something new. I have to say that the server was friendly, but not did not engage our party. We asked for recommendations and her responses were rather brief. We had the impression that the server had not sampled many of the dishes.
Luckily she had the pot roast, so I ordered the Apple Cider Pot Roast which by the description appeared quite tasty. Sadly, the dish was not appetizing as it was plated in a small pool of grease and after asking the server if the dish was to be so greasy, I sent it back.
I only hope the cook had an off night and the next time I visit, it will be a good experience.Super excited to try it since it is within walking distance of our house in Loma Linda. Went with friends and family.  Pricier than I expected, but not a huge concern...with drinks a few appetizers and entrees with sides for all 6 of us was under $250. Weight staff was very friendly, decor and inside of the old house is adorable- very clean.  Was a little disappointed that we weren't able to be seated outside on a beautiful night, despite asking to sit out there on my reservation....but, other thoughts:

Boo:
   To the WAY overdone asparagus....was practically burnt.
    To the oily (not greasy, oily) flat iron steak half of us had.  Had to blot it off with their fancy napkins to even eat it.

Meh:
  To the trout dish....loved the sliced almonds, but other than that, was not very flavorful (though it was NOT fishy tasting, so that was a plus!)
   To the bone marrow....a smidge gelatinous, but tasty, though I wish the bread they served with it wasn't as hard as a hockey puck.


Yeah!
    To the fingerling potatoes! Delish
     To the yellow beets....omg.

Will definitely try again, but probably just for small plates and not an entree.  Would definitely be plenty of food.I recently ate here. At first, I was feeling great about the place. The restaurant had really good energy. The service was fast. The menu was really small. I ordered and the food was good. Nothing exceptional. But then I saw one of the cooks chewing as he was making a salad. I continued to watch him and sure enough he was popping lettuce into his mouth. He was eating part of the salad he was preparing for a customer. This really grossed me out. Shortly after eating here I got a stomach ache. I could only help but wonder if it was because of the poor health standards of this cook. He was a Hispanic male in his 30 s. I won't be returning any time soon.I started going here when they first opened and they were great! Everything was very fresh. Portions and pricing were descent and I loved getting the dressing tossed in the salad.  I always got the tilapia because I don't like, as previous mentioned, the protein selection (packaged/fake grill marks). However, I recently noticed quality/freshness had diminished and prices have gone up. 

Recommendations:

Get rid of the microwave!! At least put it in the back so I don't see you microwave the frozen tilapia I order! Invest in a grill and quality will skyrocket. 

The soup used to be made fresh daily and served from a pot. Now it's stored in a cooler where they also place in the microwave when you order. Chicken noodle  is delicious but a little salty. 

Staff is always short-handed. They need to hire at least 1 more person between 11-1pm and 5-7pm because service is so slow (not the fault of the employee)! I usually go in with another person and it takes us at least 15 min to get our food. 

Hopefully, the owner takes a look at this and makes some changes. I really want this place to stay open, considering there aren't very many quick/healthy places for lunch/dinner.

I will still go back and enjoy a salad from time to time, but with these changes I would probably go back everyday! I think a couple of improvements will make this a hot spot for lunch/dinner!As far as sports collector stores go, this place is A-OK. Rob was very informative and knowledgable. They are a small store but they have a decent variety of sport collectibles. My favorite was their Johnny Unitas and Archie cards, which were in amazing condition.We were excited to try a new independent restaurant in the neighborhood, but we ended up a bit disappointed. We we understanding of the wait on a holiday weekend, but it took nearly 45 minutes to get our food once we ordered.  Good news....we did enjoy the food once it arrived.  
The management handled the situation very well, because of this we will likely try them again, but there seem to be a lot of bugs to work out!The food is a 4 star, bordering on 5. Gluten free pancakes of all varieties, which is awesome. Decor and cleanliness, 5 stars.  However, it is so loud in here, it's almost unbearable. The music was loud, so people were talking louder....uuuggghh. I'm here for breakfast, not to feel like I'm at a bar. Speaking of drinks, the soda was gross, completely flat and I never got a new one, I had to get iced tea instead. That should be a simple fix, but apparently not. Service was slow, but the waitress was very nice. 
I've been to the one in Denver multiple times, so I was very excited when it came here. I'll give it a few months before I come back so they can work out the kinks.The food and beverages are always predictably good, the staff are always predictably friendly, and the seating is very much adequate. My only complaint, otherwise I'd give 4 or 5 stars, is the Internet access is super flaky. I'd come here to work but after far too many lost VPN connections there is absolutely no way I could trust this Wi-Fi service with my job duties. (In fact, I had to post this with the PotBelly WiFi because the Starbucks connection went down while logging into yelp.)This place is on par with every other sandwich chain like it. I still prefer Wildflower Bread Co, but this is a good place to see the real housewives of Gilbert during the week.I used to love Firefly, but unfortunately it is nothing like what it used to be.   The big disappointment over the years has been the change of the atmosphere.

The first Firefly we went to many years back was in downtown Vegas.  Although the seating was nothing special, the great view of the old casinos and the light show made for a very cool atmosphere.

The second Firefly we went to was at their PREVIOUS/smaller Paradise location.   That one had some cool seating with couches and what not, giving that a very cool atmosphere as well.

Suffice to say that when we were seated at their CURRENT Paradise location, it was a bit of a letdown.   The atmosphere is completely missing in this larger location of theirs on Paradise.   They tried to give it some atmosphere with the candles and red hue, but the space is just too big and open for sit down tables for that to work well.   

The red pitchers of Sangria are still delicious and well worth the $28.     

The tapas don't seem to stand out to me as they used to; they were all good, but nothing really stuck out as being delicious.

The old Fireflys used to be something we would visit every time we would go to Vegas.   With this latest experience, things have changed.Not bad.  Seemed a lot more like Chipotle than Hawaiian anything, but food was pretty decent.I see my Yelp buds checking into this place from time to time. But I gots to say...I wasn't too impressed.  So, here we go...

The gf and I came here to meet a few Yelp peeps and to drop off some donations at Yosi.  When we arrived, our Yelp buds were already here and the place wasn't busy.  One thing I immediately noticed, no one had food on their tables. I assumed that they all ordered and were just waiting for their food. About 10 minutes later, one of the employees arrive at their table to finally take their order. Say What?  You know what that meant.  That meant that it's going to take about 15 minutes or so for just our orders to be taken.  Yes, I was right, but it was more like 20 minutes.  Ordering their food is simple, you start at the top with your base, then add to it with whatever they have to offer (i.e. beef, shrimp, egg rolls, shrimp, chicken, etc), and then add toppings of your choice.  I got their Loco Kaba Moco with Chicken Karaage and Chicken Katsu.  I also used my free check in to have mushrooms added.  I thought that food was just okay, nothing spectacular.  I have to admit, I'm not a curry fan.  But Kaba's curry is pretty good.  The karaage and katsu was average.  Remember I had mushrooms added?  Well, they didn't. They forgot the mushrooms, but at this point I didn't care since it was part of my free Yelp check in. 

But back to the service, when our food arrived, they forgot to give me utensils.  And you know me, I need a fork for everything.  I eventually got my fork so I can chow down.  My gurlpren's food took a little longer and when it finally arrived, they decided to be consistent with their service and fail to get her utensils too. 

So, overall my experience here was just okay. I didn't have too many issues with my food because I knew what to expect based on the price and what I was eating. I was just a little disappointed with the overall service. Will I be back? Perhaps, maybe, or maybe not.   

PS:  I turn into the Hulk when I'm starving. I go from hangry to angry. And you wouldn't want to see me when I'm angry. 


YELP PERSONAL CHALLENGE 2013 - (491/500)We went during opening week because we had a coupon for a free "snack size" wing to promote their grand opening. The food was as expected. I tend to think I like spicy things. The medium sauce was not spicy to me so I'll definitely be trying the hot next time we go. 

Because it was opening week the service seemed a bit off/discombobulated. When we got our food, there was an additional plate of plain wings we didn't order. The person said we could have it anyway since they already made it. Cool. Except they charged us for it at the end of the meal. The manager was very nice and removed the item from our ticket so no big deal. We all ordered iced tea. The first round was good, the refill was water! When I tried to explain that the tea was brewed wrong I got a very blank look and a replacement glass of... water. I tried to explain again that the tea was not brewed correctly and finally got a third glass of correctly brewed iced tea. 

Will go again and hopefully this time all the kinks will be worked out. Is conveniently located off the 101 on Indian Bend.Not the best, but definitely not the worst.

I bought a Groupon for Homejoy, booking the appointment was very easy on their site and I liked that you could add extra services - like having your fridge cleaned, laundry, etc. 

They were very punctual and polite. Overall I wouldn't say she did a bad job, it's just for 6.5 hours of cleaning and quite a bit of money (the groupon and then adding on services and extra cleaning hours), I would have expected my kitchen table or counters wiped off. There were several other common areas that were not dusted.My baseboards were not wiped down like they said they would be. Mirrors, tv and appliances had streaks on them. I was just expecting more. 

I really liked that they sent a survey after she left. I ended up calling customer service before they could contact me. They were really great, very understanding and worked hard to provide me with a solution that I was happy with. 

Overall, not the worst experience, just really not the best.My hubby and I have been looking for a place to catch a game and a pint close enough to our house to bike to, and this just might fit the bill.  The design of the bar/restaurant looks like something that you would see on the show Bar Rescue, but Bambino's is the "after" outcome.  It looks that good.  We chose the shrimp/bacon quesadilla which was tasty, but there was way more bacon compared to shrimp.  The buns on the sliders we ordered were quite crispy and had a little too much butter on them.  We were looking forward to the chocolate cookie dessert with ice cream on top, but were a little disappointed.  The cookie was huge but it tasted very "floury."  It wasn't heated up enough, so it was hard on the outside and softer on the inside.  I think it would have been better if the cookie was half-baked when you order it instead of just heated up.  The drink specials were really good and we are looking forward to returning for happy hour.  We'll have to try other menu items to see if we like them more than what we had the first time.Their food is alright, but it's a good atmosphere and they have great happy hour deals. They often have live music which is always fun!Standard Dunkin Donuts fare but when I come here it's more for the coffee than the food. I absolutely love Dunkin Donuts coffee! If you go in the morning, don't be in a hurry because they take forever. They only have 1 cashier and if everyone in front of you is ordering a dozen donuts and enough drinks to fill a drink carrier as was the case this morning, then you'll be waiting quite a while. I was hoping to be in and out and on the way to work but instead waited in line for about 10 min and then another few min waiting for my latte and bacon&egg wrap. Next time I'll only be stopping by when I have plenty of time! Saw a sign for 99 cent lattes from 2-6 PM that sounded like a good deal thoughService was good until we actually sat down to eat. It took longer then expected. We had a host by the name on StaciLynn whom was energetic but very slow. My girlfriend and I seen a mass load of people coming in and having to wait also the wait to pay for the food was long.First off, we are HUGE fans of Citizen Public House and very much "foodies" so we were very excited to try The Gladly. Unfortunately, for the most part, we were disappointed. Not with the service or the trendy atmosphere... It was the food. And we tried a lot of it with multiple recommendations from the waiter. 

1. Fondue (2 out of 5 stars)... Cheese was a 10, but the accoutrement was just meh. ESP the smoked pork butt which should have been the star. It was basically processed Canadian bacon cubed up. 
2. Pecan smoked grilled vegetables (1 out of 5 stars). Weird rutabagas, parsnips and baby carrots with some weird chick pea pancake. Was supposed to have manchego cheese on it, but no dice. Not sure it would have helped. 
3. Octopus salad (2 out of 5 stars). Octopus was good, but the overall flavor profile was WAY too aggressive. From the peppercorns to the bitter grapefruit. No beuno. We should have stuck to the chopped salad, but stupid us for trying something new. 
4. The Pigstrami (5 out of 5 stars). The sandwich is Bomb! The pastrami is think cut, tender, some of the best I've ever had. Great cheese, rye bread and housemade ketchup for the fries. I'd come back for this. 

Good beer selection, good drinks, but much better food at CPH. If you go and check out the Gladly, steer clear of the "misses" outlined above.I was craving pancakes so me and another friend decided to go to IHOP. The one near ASU was closed so this was our last or closest resort. Right when we walked in it was full blast on A/C. I love A/C, but man I was freezing, lol. The customer service was ok. It took about 15 min. to get us our drinks. The food came out in a timely manner, but I didn't like the crispy chicken salad I got. Crepes with strawberries was good. Overall it was alright even though the service was slow, but it looked like there was only one waitress there.We first went after a long bike ride and it was exactly what we wanted and needed to refuel! I had shrimp, brown rice and sweet potatoes. Seasoned well and reheated great too! My bf loves the kimchi steak. 

Why it won't be my weekly post gym spot: 

The only non-soda drinks they offer are iced tea or bottled water. Really? There are so many amazing health conscious and unique beverage choices out there. 

All food is served in togo containers and all flatware is plastic. And all beverages are served in styrofoam cups. Ughhh, 1990s called. So even if I finish my meal, I still bring my garbage home to recycle because they don't. Why is Vegas so wasteful?! 

I will go back bc it's my style of lunch but Ill bring my own drink and take my food home.Simple cafe that does it's job. coffee, pastries, etc.  There is nothing overly unique or spectacular about this place.  If you're nearby and you want a coffee this place will serve its purpose.Mixed feelings- Loved the atmosphere. Service was great. Prices were slightly high but still reasonable. Food was served at temp and wine list was impressive, for how small it was. Negatives- I don't care for "flimsy" pizza and this is pizza that will not hold the toppings. So- order a cheese and leave it at that. Tiramisu was as good as it gets. Lasagna made with ground beef instead of sausage? It's good but- I don't recommend it if you want a bold flavor. Speaking of that- pizza sauce was mild and not enough on mine (although, it would have just run off). Pizza dough was so good I could not believe it.
So- another visit is in order. Sit at the bar. Order beer and get a cheese pizza. Maybe put a topping on the side so it won't slide off!went through the drive thru, service was good. ckn was good and soft, very yummy esp. there cane sauce. the fries were mediocre and some were over cooked. not a coleslaw fan. but the toast was good. overall a decent meal for 9.07 that i split with my son. better places out there.I really wanted this place to be amazing, and I'll tell you the food looked amazing it just didn't taste as good. 

We came here for dinner and drinks and had a nice waiter who must have had a few too many customers to handle, we waited about 20 minutes to get the drinks we ordered. While we waited though we had some great conversation and enjoyed looking around the bar and people watching. 

We ended up ordering some beers and we were really thrilled that they had Stiegl Grapefruit Radlers here- it's a fantastic beer for the hot Vegas weather. 

While the drinks were great, we ended up ordering the barrel fried chicken to share after we saw the really cool barrel serving tray they use to display the meal. The chicken came out and smelled amazing, unfortunately it ended up being more breading and fat than chicken. The fries and biscuits were great, but we ended up avoiding the chicken. 

I want to say I'd give this restaurant another try, but with so many options in Vegas I think I'll pass, unless I want another refreshing radler.I like the half sizes for lunch just enough to fill you up but not overly full.  I had the Night in White Satin which was good not too truffly.  I was worried as I don't like too much truffle oil.  Flavor was yummy!  It's a pretty small place, only 4 tables and it did take a while to get our food.  More of a take out place.My cousin and I stopped in at their Elliot Road location.  We were actually looking for another restaurant but couldn't find it so this was the back-up.  It was about 1:30 in the afternoon so we were about the only people in the place and they were in the process of closing for the day.  Still, the service was attentive, polite and professional.  Kind of felt like we were regular truckers on our way through Iowa.

Cousin had the pulled pork sandwich with cole slaw and I had a BLT with fries.  Both meals came with a huge, ice cold Dill pickle.  He said his meal was very tasty.  The only fault I could find with mine was the fries tasted a little bit like they'd been cooked in oil used for frying fish but it wasn't overpowering and a little malt vinegar and ketchup solved that problem.  

We each ordered iced tea and it came in a glass I swear was the size of a small jug.  No sooner had we downed about half of it when the waitress came by again with refills.  And the tea tasted like real tea too.

They had Oldies on the radio which added a bit to the country type ambiance of the place.  The menu I would describe as American comfort food right out of the Heartland.  The prices seemed a bit high until you see the size of the servings.  It was more than enough to eat.

This restaurant is in the same building that has hosted several others before it including a Denny's and a Chicago-something.  They feature a fish fry on Friday evenings, the only dinner time they are open.  I plan to try that sometime soon.  Oh, did I mention they have liver and onions?  A favorite of my wife and I and something you can't find everywhere.  That's on the bucket list too.  

I rated them three stars only because I haven't sampled but one meal so far.  But I, we, will be back.I stopped in for lunch yesterday.  Brock was my server, he did a good job.  No complaints there.

I ordered the Beet salad and a cup of the chicken tortilla soup.  Both were delicious.  I would definitely stop in again and try some dinner.Super cute concept: like a self-serve yogurt place for adults! I thought it was really great that they pass out free samples. 

Prices are a bit insane, but that's what I would expect on the Strip. You cannot taste the alcohol in the drinks at all, and I'm doubtful they include much. Would much prefer you buy a shot and then add the mixes on top (like Coyote Ugly now does at NY NY). I shouldn't have to buy an additional shot. 

I would come back because this was kinda a fun thing to do with friends, and the decor and experience was fun.This is only the 2nd Checkers I've been to and I'm really glad to see this one is an actual building where you can go inside. The one in Savannah, GA was just a walk up window with outdoor seating. 

The food is your standard fast food fare and similar to stuff you would see at A&W or DQ and most of it is super cheap. I got a 4 chicken finger combo w/ fries and drink for 5 bucks and included 2 dipping sauces! The service here is mediocre as the tables were kind of dirty and when it was my turn a guy cut in front of me and spent 2 min asking about and trying to order an ice cream cone wtf. The cashier took his order and didn't say anything about him stepping in front of me as I was walking up to the counter from where I had been standing looking at the menu.

The location is in the middle of the hood on Rancho but it's near work for me so I'm sure I'll be back again by default. They also have a drive thru just in case you're not brave enough to go insideHate to rain on everybody's parade, but I was not impressed.  The place is cute, but I am not going to go out of my way to come here.  The selection of wines is pretty small for a wine bar.  I had the J Vineyards Brut Rose ($12).  I mentioned to the server/only employee of the place that I was at J Vineyards last year with a friend and tried their wines.  I was debating which one of the sparkling wines to order and I didn't get any response.  I am not sure if she was knowledgeable of the wines.  I also wanted to order the only item available, but I was ignored until she needed my menu to hand it to a guy at the other end of the bar.  I had the meat and cheese plate ($15).  It was ok, nothing to really write home about.  I have other choices closer to my house.  I might come back if friends set up a get together there, but I certainly won't go on my own.Simple store with basic indian groceries. Store is clean and staff are courteous. Items are pricey , minimum of 20% more than market price. I like the store except for the pricesItems Selected:
Monte Cristo French Toast - Turkey, Ham, Cheddar, Fried Egg, Raspberry Jelly, Fire & Ice Spring Salad
Soy Caramel Chicken Wings and Waffle 
Chili Cheese Dog - Beef Chili, Cheddar, Green Onions
Gang-nam Dog - Roasted Pork Belly, Cucumber, Nori, Sesame Seed
Euro Special Fries - Pork Belly Bacon, Cheddar, Herb Blend, Garlic Mayo

From a small storefront and food trucks peddling Korean inspired hotdogs to a proper restaurant serving up breakfast, lunch, and dinner one could best describe Boyzie Milner's new Buldogi's Café an expansion on concept; all the familiar faces accounted for and joined by a few new friends in a homey little space on Spring Mountain Road.  Originally opened as early as 7am but since trimming its hours to an eleven o'clock start it was just after 1:15 on a Saturday afternoon when my family and I entered the lightly decorated space and without another patron present as Biggie Hypnotize'd us a bit too loudly from overhead the menu was perused - a quintet of items both time-tested and trendy ordered and paid for at the counter even though full table service was provided by the lone waitress/server/busser/hostess from beginning to end.  Beginning first with three Buldogi classics, two all-beef hotdogs and one order of fries, it should go without saying that both the franks and the house-made toppings were excellent and although fries proved a bit limp the combination of garlic and pork proved surprisingly light, the later gracing the briny Gang-nam for a smoky sapor that I only wish would have been present in the watery ham atop the underwhelming, bready, and overcooked Monte Cristo that arrived alongside an equally doughy waffle thankfully rescued by reference standard Korean Fried Chicken, crispy and lacquered with briny soy-caramel - by far the best bite of the afternoon and the best Korean Fried Chicken I've found in town.  Obviously a work in progress and still looking to find its footing amongst the staunch competition of Spring Mountain suffice it to say that sticking to the classics is a safe bet at Buldogi café while wandering to more Americanized novelties is a risk; one Milner and team might better approach by being as creative as they are with the dogs - the pork belly and a quick trip to the deep fryer could do wonders for that sandwich.Overall a solid semi-gourmet burger joint, brand new inside the Palms!

It's located next to the Palms Pool, with indoor and outdoor seating RIGHT on the pool deck!

Prices are around $11 per burger...$6-8 per fry.  For the price and setting I was a bit disappointed that they would not cook my burger medium rare, and was told they ALL get cooked MW-WD.  Shame!

I went with the Barry Burger ($11): Smoked Bacon, Cheddar, Charred Red Onion & Balsamic Ketchup on Sesame Bun. Good burger and still a bit juicy considering it was cooked medium well. It's missing a mayo/aioli in my opinion, but it's a solid burger with GOOD flavor in the toppings.  Towards the end, a large chunk of red onion dropped out, about the size of a GRAPE.  Attention to detail guys!!  Wasn't that busy today...

Blue Cheese & Bacon Fries ($8). These were DELICIOUS and had tons of flavor...Recommended!  The portion was a decent size, and the flavor was very good.

And to finish, Vanilla Custard with Reeses Pieces ($6). Pretty good, just wish these were peanut butter cups...started getting ROCK hard towards the bottom.  The custard was thick and rich...I'd try the chocolate custard next visit though.

Overall, a SOLID choice inside the Palms!I stopped by on Day 2 of it's opening. All the sandwiches are served with chimichurri sauce and voila, you get the restaurant's name. There are about 5 different sandwich options as well as a few empanada choices. All the sandwiches are served on bread similar to that of a torta and when it comes right down to it, they basically are tortas-served on a loaf rather than a round. Meat, cheese, lettuce, peppers, mayo...if it tastes like a torta, looks like a torta, it is one. And I think this is where the restaurant will stumble. Sandwiches here go around $9.00 (accompanied by a smattering of fries). For a slightly lower price, you can go to the numerous Mexican restaurants that serve a far superior sammy.  The chimichurri sauce is solid but they need to mix it up (different flavor profiles, etc) if they want to make it for the long haul.I had super high expectations when I came to place. I tried their Captain Crunch ice cream & I bought a dozen of cupcakes (~$40). And I was really... let down? Yes, everything was good but it didn't give me the WOW FACTOR that I was looking for in places like this. 

Overall, moist & yummy cupcakes plus yummy ice cream? Delicious combination, but way too overpriced in my opinion.I drive by this place everyday to work. Finally stopped by on my day off with my daughter. I got the chopped salad and she got the chicken panini. The salad I could of made at home and better. I am not kidding when I say it had one slice of bell pepper, a few bits of cheese and pepperoni. It was all lettuce. If I'm going to pay 9.00 for a chopped salad I am going to get my money's worth and go up the street to Oreganos. My daughter's panini was bland and the fries that came with it were underdone (hard inside and cold). The place is attractive and the outdoor bar is really nice. But, the food doesn't cut it. Will not go back nor would I recommend.I would love to give this place at least 4 stars but there were a couple of problems that are hard to overlook.

I am a huge fan of Giada's and booked her restaurant 2 months ago, so looking forward to a great meal.  The hostesses were great and did honor the request for a window table, but it was half an hour after the reservation time.  No biggie because the room is comfortable and the view was fantastic.  The waiter was very good and tried his best to push the tasting menu, but we already knew what we wanted.  Here is the breakdown of dishes.

1.  Lobster Arancini- 8  Very good... red sauce was the best part.
2.  Shrimp Scampi- 8  Marscapone made this dish, but shrimp seemed of a lesser quality.  Polenta cake was perfect.
3.  Artchoke Soup- 10  What an amazing soup, great taste and texture.
4.  Pasta Fagiole- 10  My partner loved it.
5.  Lobster Ravioli-10  This was too delicious to describe, perfect dish.
6.  Rack of Lamb- 3  The pictures on Yelp make this dish look great, but our lamb was incredibly fatty.  The waiter said it was because it was Colorado lamb and I felt intimidated not to send it back.  Never again; there were only 4 tiny bites out of the whole dish.  The spinach served with it was delicious, though.
     The worst part of it was the half hour wait between the soup course and the FAT of the Lamb course.  Way too long of a wait.  The server did say a couple of times that it would be right up, but never apologized for the wait.  That lamb dish was $45 for nothing... I want my money back!

Overall it was a decent experience, but not worth $240.  The bottles of wine start in the $50 range and go up from there.  There should be more reasonably priced options, especially in the Italian categories... been to Italy several times and even good wines are a bargain.  They are trying to hype this restaurant as more casual dining as if you were having dinner in someones home.  Somewhat pricey for a home cooked meal.  

Probably would not return for dinner, but might try lunch sometime if Giada has some amazing paninis on the menu.

One more item of interest- We saw tank-tops, tee shirts, tennis shoes, shorts, midriffs, sandals and every other type of dress here.  Not sure there is a dress code.
