Class act here. We in today with our C421 (N21GF)  for college football game. Top of line service for all our needs. Rent car brought out plane-side for our use. Line service very attentive to all our requests and anticipations. Nice lobby for pax and crew needs. One of the better service stops we have been into...ever. Today was a test for all the staff here because of the heavy traffic coming in for ball game. They were on top of things for sure. Thanks folks. Really well done.This venue is awesome of breakfasts, luncheons, etc. the staff is awesome and always are so on top of things. The food is so delicious and there is always plenty of varieties to choose from. The price point is great!Easily one of my favorite, authentic Mexican food spots.The menu has everything one could ever crave and the salsa bar provides a wide range of choices.  I have been looking for a great, down-home, authentic Mexican joint for three years--I finally found it. Perfect.Hands down the best flour tortillas I have ever had. I had a carne asada burrito and I couldn't tell you what the meat tasted like because all I can remember is that tortilla. It was soft, thick and flavorful, it definitely made the burrito.Consistently delicious.This place is so cute. Food is delicious. Good for brunch. $3 mimosas. Also good for dinner. Crab cakes are amazing, and what they're known for.This place is fantastic, and is one of the reasons I love Yelp.  I would have never found this place otherwise, even if you spotted me the square mile that it's located in.  It's the ultimate hole-in-the-wall, and the best Mexican food I've ever eaten.

I have some thrilling news to share.  THERE IS ANOTHER RITO'S (opened by the son of the owner).  It's every bit as good and may be more convenient for you.  It's at 51st Ave. and Orangewood - Rito's Burritos in the little strip mall.  Naturally I tested the green chile burro enchilada style and it was exactly the same, right down to the oversized pie plate.  Ahhh...

Don't worry, for those that are concerned Rito's is going corporate, the new place still has those stylish iron bars between you and the kitchen, and although it has bathrooms, they are perpetually "under repair," according to the glossy, pre-printed sign they've mounted on the wall.  And of course it's still cash-only.  So they have preserved that special charm. 

I know this will make the line longer at the new place, but it would be unfair not to share the good news, especially when I learned about the original from here.  Enjoy!The ceviche is the best I've tried in phoenix. Draft Mexican beer selection is great. Fair pricing on drinks and food. Have not tried anything here that's disappointed.Took winter visitors to see the Chihuly exhibit. The weather was beautiful, the garden grounds magnificent! Hard to fully explain the impact it has. Especially loved the Saint Earth sculpture! Go, go, go. The money is well worth it.Best Mexican I have ever had!  A weekly must...  Family owned and operated, great people and relaxing atmosphere!This is a smaller, older, happier Aj's. A go-to spot for produce if you can't get to the CenPho downtown market or the Guadeloupe Farmer's Market. Very helpful and unpretentious service for wine and liquor. Good for pizza-by-the-slice (I like the veggie).

Hot tip: Flowers are half-off from 4:00 to 6:00 on Friday. They have some really cool single-stems, so you could do something snazzy on the cheap.

Fun fact: Chris Bianco used to make pizzas here in the late '80s, when the store was called Euromarket. Talk about nostalgia -- you could grab a Bianco pizza and eat outside with only a ten minute wait!I really like this place. The atmosphere is nice and the good is really good. My girlfriend doesn't like their sushi. I think it's good for inexpensive sushi and a sake for lunch. There's a calamari salad that's very good. Recommended.I had driven past schreiner's for ages and not realized that there was a meat store attached to their facility.

What a gem! Best place to see locovores and Valley chef's on a daily basis.

I pick up lunch meet charcuterie of salami's and pepperoni's sliced to order. 

Sausages deliver a whole treat, with several choices ranging from breakfast (maple, fig, bacon) to dinner sausages and everything in between.

Bring a cooler and cash! You will want to load up.My parents were in town a few weeks ago, and when my parents are in town, we like to take them to restaurants that they've never been to before.  My dad appreciates good food, and we had a feeling he'd like Coup Des Tartes, so that's where we found ourselves on that particular Saturday night.

We brought the wine (a bottle of red and a bottle of white) and my parents picked up the tab... such a deal!  We were seated in the back room - one I'd never even seen before... there was just our table and three other tables in the little room.  I convinced my mom to share the signature salad with me to start... and although Jared asked my dad to share the onion tart as an appetizer, my dad insisted on ordering his own.  (It worked out though, so I was able to take a few bites of the tart too).  For our meals, my mom and Jared went with the chicken, I had the salmon, and my dad went for the steak.  My fish was cooked just perfectly and served with an amazing butternut squash risotto and some green beans too.  Everyone enjoyed their meals and despite the fact that we were all pretty full, we went ahead and ordered the mixed berry tart with four forks for dessert.  We cleaned that plate too.

Needless to say, we were right about my dad enjoying his meal at Coup Des Tartes.  We've always had great meals at Coup Des Tartes and we're sure to be back again real soon.Pleasantly surprised! Chilean sea bass as well as both of the tarts were wonderful. We brought our two and six year old along and they were extremely accommodating. Great dishes with the exception of one of the salads which was a bit over salted. The place itself is very quaint and the host was warm and understanding of our children and their needs for crayons and such. Would love to return.I'm trying all the Chicago joints lately and stopped here because my patient told me that Luke's had a very good beef. Went in and had combo, extra hot, dipped.  Beef was very good, gonnella bread, homemade giardiner was a nice change and really added to the peppery taste.  Hotdogs don't remind me of home but they have RC and that alone puts u in 5 stars.  Best pop ever!  I'd go for the beef, fries, RCI've lived in the Biltmore/Camelback Corridor area for some time and had always driven by Rochelle's but never stopped in.  I finally got tired of my longtime hair dresser never listening to me and popped in one day.  My only request for my first appointment was that I work with someone who is good with long hair (I'm like a modern-day Rapunzel, or Dee Snider if you prefer).  I had my first appointment with Dania a couple of months ago, and I'm kicking myself for not visiting Rochelle's sooner!  Dania is extremely skilled at what she does, and she's really just a treat to be around.  I've been to see her three times now (once for a quick 'fix' because I'm picky, and she was all smiles to do so!) and I don't think I'll ever trust my hair to anyone else.  I've gotten SO MANY compliments on my cut and color, it makes me wonder why I stayed at my old salon for so long...

The salon itself is great, too.  Much more modern and spacious than my old salon, with better music and magazines to boot (the important stuff, right?).  I also love that they use Bumble & bumble products!  Dania and Rochelle's have a customer for life.This is a favorite GEM of ours in the middle of north central phoenis.  We ALWAYS take the stairs down to hide out in the basement with the BEST bartender in the world - STEVE (aka Jared) we love you. 

The scallops are my favorite, as are the brussel sprouts, the BEEF, and the desserts.  The vodka and soda gives you a shot of vodka in a glass with ice and you pour the soda...watch out! :-)

I DO recommend it, and don't worry about the crowds...just call ahead and reserve a table in the basement and you'll enjoy your relaxing evening.Freakin' love this place. Even tho I've never actually been in the place, I order from them all the time. Quick delivery. Decent prices. And DELICIOUS food. You HAVE to try the garlic knots. Girls who take your orders are always very nice.Two words: Jalepeno Margarita.  Just go.  Trust me.I love Saks, I went into the shoe store when in was in NYC which hasit's own zip code. I bought some basic black Gucci pumps and I still love them. Last time I was in Saks on Camelback in Phoenix, I went to the Chanel counter to get a bag fixed and everyone was so helpful. I wandered around the store and as  I stepped in to the shoe department, Kourosh asked if he could help me. He is  very knowlegable about the inventory.  He showed me some beautiful shoes and was so patient as I tried on several pair. He has a great eye for style. I would highly recommend that you ask for him if you know exactly what shoes you want, and especially if you don't, so he can help you find your style.An absolute must for all Orthodox Christians or for those fascinated by monastic life. This is the only Greek Orthodox monastery in North America and founded by a living saint, Father Ephraim. I drove from Los Angeles, but people come from all over the world to stay as a pilgrim at this monastery. The 45 or so monks living here run a tight ship keeping the holly grounds in tip top shape. It's immaculate, with lush gardens, fountains, and gazebos. They've turned the place into an oasis in the middle of a hot ,dry cacti ridden desert. 

There are several chapels within the monastery and one major church where most of the magic takes place. Most of the furniture and icons are brought in from Mt. Athos, considered one of the most holly places for Greek Orthodoxies. Sadly, no women are allowed on Mt. Athos. But that's besides the point. Women must wear long skirts and wear a mandili or scarf to cover their hair, basically do not show any skin. Men must wear long sleeve shirts and pants. 

You can visit for the day or stay overnight as a pilgrim. If you are a pilgrim you can stay from 1 -10 days. You must attend all services, which means the big one from 1:45 AM to 4:00 AM every night. The first night I went at 1 AM and was able to kiss Father Ephraim's hand. After the night morning service, there is a breakfast of freshly baked bread (the monks bake like crazy), large and small bitter green olives from the olive orchards grown on the grounds, 2 types of halva, jam, nuts, fresh fruit from their orchards and coffee. This is a typical fasting breakfast (no animal products). After breakfast you go back to bed for another 3 hours of quiet time. Walking back to my room at 5 AM was beautiful. The desert stars and moon are bright, casting shadows on the cacti and the air is cool and fresh. In the day you are pretty much free to roam. Lunch is served at 11:30 AM and there is no talking aloud, except for a monk reading a chosen bible passage in Greek. When they ring the bell, you are allowed to pour water. A typical fasting lunch that I had consisted of braised green beans with calamari, fresh bread, olive, salad, and Greek macaroni. After lunch you can try to get a blessing from Father Ephraim, go to the book store, talk to some monks or other pilgrims. Another mandatory service is Vespers at 3:30 PM - 4:30 PM and afterwards dinner is served. After dinner is the last mandatory service. And then you are ready to go to bed at 7:30. No joke. I fell asleep before quiet hours even - I was feeling extremely peaceful and happy, yet exhausted. 

I will be back to the monastery with my dad. I was lucky to stay two nights with profoundly holly people and have an incredible experience.Get the asiago cheese bagel with sun-dried tomato cream cheese!!!!!!!!!I have been craving the heck out of this place!  I finally looked it up and found there was one not too far from me that I hadn't known about.  I might make that a lunch run but MAN I just want to be back at this one!   It's special.  Oh... it's not just the sandwiches - though they are super yummy.  The Symphony is my favorite, with it's yummy turkey breast, bacon, alfalfa, tomato, alfalfa sprouts and cream cheese spread on 12 grain bread (I have them hold the avocado).  SO good every time!

But what makes this particular location so special?  

Firemen.  

Yup.  Firemen.  There must be a firehouse nearby because at least 4 out of 5 times I've gone over there there were groups of firemen.  

Hello???  Hot firemen and good sandwiches??  Yum yum yummie.What can I say about this place that hasn't been said before? This place amazing In every way shape and form!These folks have kept my cars clean and shiny for almost 20 years. 

I drove there yesterday (July 20, 2013) for a wash ... and the place is not only closed, it has been TORN DOWN. 

It was one of the best hand washes in town, and two days earlier, it was still operating. 

The buildings next to it have gone, too, and there's construction equipment there now.  So I'm betting that whatever they're about to build, it won't be a car wash. 

Wonder what Big Jay and his guys are going to do now. 

This is not good news.One thing I have to say

BEST BRUSCHETTA EVER!!!!I was visiting a friend for the weekend and didn't have much time and wanted to go to my favorite places that I've already tried and liked.  She suggested we try Postinos but I whined because it meant we would miss one of the other places I'd been thinking about for months.  I'm so lucky she pushed the issue and took me here!  I don't even remember those other places and want to visit her again so we can eat at Postios!

We were there before 5 and did the $5 wine special and a bunch of the bruchettas plus a salad.  All of it was delish.  I didn't want to share!  I will say the food combos were fantastic but simple enough to try at home.  I grabbed a take-out menu and brought it back to Los Angeles and have been making my own bruchettas that taste pretty close.  My whole family raves about them.Love Postino. They have a fantastic brunch on the weekend. Even if you are not a wine drinker you will find something you will love.This little hole in wall joint never disappoints.  The food is good and the friendly service better.   The prices are reasonable. The pizza and wings special is great. 22 bucks and  some change for a large with 2 toppings and 30 wings!Consistently good food great service and a fun crowd. Great bartenders and friendly owners. Get some!!restaurant week...yay! our first stop in this bi-annual event and it was not disappointing. 

i will have to say, for someone who doesn't get this far away from the house to eat out, it is a bit tricky to find the restaurant. we entered the first entrance to the resort on which this restaurant is located and drove around for a good 10 minutes. went up the hill, then down the hill. to the pool area and back. a staff member said "follow the signs" which we tried but only ended up back at the entrance. finally called from the property and were directed appropriately. 

the layout inside is very big. it felt cozy, kind of like a ski lodge with lots of dark wood and mood lighting. the bar sits up high and the restaurant is below. i ordered the calamari and it was cooked just how i like it...ever so slightly chewy, but tender enough to not wear out my jaw. then the scallop dish which was delicious with the risotto. i'm not a risotto connosieur but it tasted great to me. for desert, i ordered the chocolate volcano cake but absolutely could not finish...my taste buds said yes, my belly said no. 

the food is heavy....heavy on the butter and richness. i was full after my entree, but with the wonderfulness of restaurant week, i just simply had to get a desert. 

my wife enjoyed her farmers salad but it was very large and she had to save room for the rest of the meal; the shrimp pasta and apple pie with ice cream. all of which she loved but also said was very heavy and filling. 

i enjoyed my meal. doubtful i could afford to eat here normally. but our service was fantastic from the concierge to the food runners to our server. a great night out.Great food... great view. Very apt for special occasions. My hubby took me there for my birthday and made it very special. A must visit.Friendly, professional and best of all...affordable!

I have had them out to my home multiple times over the past year to repair a number of older appliances and they always do a great job the first time.I love this place! Consistently delicious. Don't be fooled by the outside, this place is a gem. The chips are thin and yummy and their salsa ROCKS!!! My husband and I eat here at least once a week. It's cheap, clean and service is good. Plus, they leave you with a nice parting gift -  a cinnamon sugar 'cookie'.  We try other Mexican places and every time, we say the same thing, "damn, we should have gone to El Bravo." I am addicted.Before REI had even considered opening in Phoenix, there was Arizona Hiking Shack. The staff is knowledgeable and helpful. They are very good at fitting their customers with the right gear. They make every effort to be sure that you have what you need and are prepared for your hike, climb or backpacking event. They are also a great resource for local maps and information.I always use these guys for my alignments. 
 They do a great job if I need it, but often I don't, and they are honest about telling me. They have my loyalty and spreading the word.Thank you Sonora Quest for  having online scheduling. I had to get blood drawn the other day and I went online and made a 2:30 appointment. I showed up at 2:25, and at 2:30 they called me back and drew my blood. I was in and out in about 10 minutes. 

In previous years I have waited up to an hour, because you just had to stand in line and wait.  This new process is fantastic!Great location. Very friendly staff and pharmacy. Small town store feel with big store name.LOVE this place!  Whenever we are in the north side of town we always make it a point to drop by.  Very extensive menu, but they don't even need it because the cheese steaks are the best!! 

Very friendly service!  You can't go wrong!My first time here, this salon came highly recommended. Very nice people, Don actually listened to exactly how I imagined my nails, and did better then I expected! I love it! They work to perfection. :)Love this place. Very large with lots of nail techs.  I've never waited longer than 5 min even without appointment.  They do a fantastic job on nails and toes. They even have little kids pedi chairs...my girls love it there!!After six months of eating sushi at different places around Phoenix, I just happened to stumble on this gem.  The hamachi and salmon were amazing!  The Dec 29 roll as well, almost like eating dessert.  I'm really surprised how reviewers have not picked up on this great little sushi bar inside a Japanese restaurant.  What is also amazing is that it is maybe 0.2 mi away from a terribly overpriced trendy sushi only place that I found had terrible service and sushi that was not nearly as good as Shogun!  Nice job!Want to feel like you're in a small town?  Come here.  Why?  Because there is such an amazing sence of community here.  Sit up at the counter, try a slice of one of Peggy's famous homade pies and chat with the waitress.  She's better than any bartender.  Or better yet, bring some family or friends and sit down at one of the tables and order some real food.  Real food because it's all homemade.  From the biscuits to the chicken fried steak to the smothered chicken to the meatloaf or some real get you going breakfast food.  From scratch food at practically fast food prices.  It's insane. 

The waitresses are amazing.  Our 3rd time there we had the same waitress we had the 1st time.  She remembered our order - including a special request for gravy on the side.  Before we said it.  And it had been weeks since she saw us.  We decided it was kinda freaky - but amazingly cool at the same time. They are all amazingly nice in a down home kind of way.  Ya might get called hun.  Or sweetie.  I've seen regulars get their hair scruffled.  

One time we were there I saw the wait staff pull out the white pages to try to find the phone number for one of their regulars.  They were concerned that they hadn't seen him yet that week.  They found out he was sick, and one of the women said she'd bring him some food on her way home.  Right there and then - they had my business.  I may not live in the area anymore, but we try to make it over there at least a few times a year.  Who wouldn't want to support service like that?

When you go - be aware of their hours.  These are small town too.  
M-F 5am-9pm
Saturday - 5am-3pm
Sunday 6am-3pmOne of my favorite Mexican places to eat in Phoenix.  this is definitely a lunch place (and very busy)... the exterior has been upgraded recently so it looks kinda nicer...  the atmosphere is different.  you order your food from a window and wait for your number to be called... all seating is on your own and at times it is though to get a seat...  despite all of this the food is excellent and cheap.

If you go you should buy the tortillas to take home... they are HUGE and pretty tasty... the walls are plastered with awards for best tortillas in Phoenix...  I also recommend trying the tacos and burros...Good sign when the crowd includes policemen, firemen, business and more importantly locals.  Another good sign when my 3 and 4 year old make me wait in line not one extra time but two times so that they could get thirds.So good! The biscuits are amazing, and I highly recommend the filet. We learned that they butcher a couple cuts including the filet at the restaurant. Definitely recommended.Great Store friendly staff.  Great that they are open early on Sunday . Great selection of items too.Dr. Chris is way cool!  The staff is pleasant and efficient.  I have had very good dental care from this place.  If you are looking for quality services in the South Mountain area, give it a try.  

Nobody loves going to the dentist, but this is a comfortable, relaxed office with good care at reasonable prices.Finally got back around to this lovely Macayo's, joined today by Mike C. & Jackie C.  I went with a "Mex & Match" Lunch Special, which gives lots of choices.  Mine came with Tortilla Soup, followed by a big (Pablano) Chile Relleno, steamed veggies and a shredded beef taco, plus a little bit of salad, unlimited tasty chips, their excellent chunky red salsa.

This was a really good lunch with great table service by Kyle and priced right at $9.99.     :-))This is the best dental office I know!!! I have been to many over the years and the staff is so very pleasant and helpful. It was a wonderful experience and I never thought I would say that about a dentist. Dr. Mattern is a most compassionate and caring person. I have been "hurt" by many dentists through the years and my visit to his office for a filling was a pleasant one...never imagined it could be such a positive experience. This is definitely the only dental office I will be visiting for any reason. I wish I had found him years ago as I would have avoided so much anxiety and pain. This office and its staff was WONDERFUL. Dr. Mattern is the best dentist in the world as far as I am concerned!!!I really like their clothes. The pricing is good and so is the quality. If you shop their sales then you will always get good value and in this economy I think that is a vital aspect for any business. The only negative comment I would make is that sometimes they seem understaffed and on this visit they had half the dressing rooms closed which was not convenient and caused a wait.Lobster pot stickers, divine Butterfish, seared Ahi , chocolate lava cake all to die for!!Loved it!

This is a terrific alternative to the "look alike" restaurants in Scottsdale.

It is not fancy, meaning there are no white table cloths and the like, but the food is so good and light (and very well portioned)!

The service is friendly and good.  I had to grab my own drinks and silverware, but the table was cleared immediately when I finished.

And the price is right on!Great place !  Call ahead to save time for pick up .. very busy on saturday.  Da Bomb and Panama Red are awesome.I am no expert on Korean food, and I will never be. Oxknee soup? How does one eat an animal's knee? Huh?

Whatever. What I had was wonderful. I had beef in very hot, boiling broth with cabbage and carrots. Also had pork, which was more flavorful than I was expecting.

There's several items on the menu that was completely alien to me, so I cannot vouch for the more exotic items they offer. 

But if you like Korean, and/or want to try something new (and really good!), then check this place out.Jessica was super friendly and helpful in taking my phone order!Love this place. The food is always good so you'll have a short wait because they're busy. But it'll be worth it! Try anything on the menu it's all good.thwy even have gluten free items and healthy choices!We have been using A&P nurseries over the last 25 years and have had great service with lawn mower repairs and plant selection. I was particularly impressed with their service today. There were no less than 4 people that offered to help me with my plant selection. It is nice to go to a nursery that carries plants that grow in our harsh climate. I never trust the "big box" nurseries as many of their plants come from California and are not always adapted to this area. Always glad to give my business to a locally-owned nursery too.We have been coming here for 20 years!! Tried just about everything on the menu and never disappointed with our meal. The lunch special is awesome! Also go with Golden Gate Special Beef! My absolute fave!I bring my Chevy here to be serviced & they always do a great job.  Jon is my service advisor & he is honest & so helpful!  He's really a great guy & will take care of you.  I recommend him all the time!After a terrible battle over a van we reserved in April and not getting it the day before vacation at the Queen Creek location...this place came to our rescue, quick, painless, friendly and to the point, had our van within 10 minutes of showing up, thanks guys! WARNING: DO NOT GO TO THE QUEEN CREEK LOCATION!!!!!!!!!!We dined at the Mesa location/Superstition Springs a couple weekends ago and had "Keith B" as our server.  I rarely have the time to write reviews, but his service was outstanding and deserves praise.  We dine out all the time and he literally is one of the best servers I have ever encountered.  On the ball he was!  He definitely is a credit to their establishment and I suggest you ask for him when checking in.  Thanks to Keith, for the great dining experience!  We hope to see him again on future visits...

Oh, and the food was delicious as well!  Their steaks are awesome, in addition to their pastas.  The John Cole dessert was amazing too.GREAT service for cheap!! The most expensive car wash (the one I got) was only $9. You don't even have to get out of the car to pay! The whole car was hosed down, then hand scrubbed all BEFORE entering the automatic wash! A plastic bag/shield was even put over my rear windshield wiper. (To keep them safe?!) Very excellent washing! After exiting a person dries you all off. Vacuums also available.Full Suspension, 29er Tires, Tubeless Tires, Disc Brakes, Light Weight, that I do not have to upgrade for a few years is what I was looking for. Brand names didn't matter too much as long as it was one of the common ones. So I just bought a Trek Fuel EX 7 29, a helmet, and gloves from A.B.C. today and it was a good experience. I did my homework online being new to bikes in 2013 but I still needed a bit of insight from an experienced rider. My previous bike was from the 90s and although it still rides, it is way out of date and seen better days.

I walked in and Zach helped me out, answered all my questions and gave insight to the latest bike technology and where to ride trails in the area. I was also about to buy a $200+ bike rack before I went in to A.B.C. and Zach hooked me up by adding a $35 bike mount to a 2x6 piece of wood that easily goes in the back of my truck bed that my bike can set in for travel. 

I checked out a few other bike shops in the area with kind of uninterested employees who didn't seem like they even owned bikes and these guys here at A.B.C. seem to all enjoy riding bikes and each employee said they owned both mountain and road bikes. Pretty happy with my purchase even though I am getting use to 2013 prices, ouch! But you really get what you pay for. 

I just went for a quick ride tonight along the canal in my neighborhood and I can not wait to take this thing out on the trails! ;-)You can't go wrong visting this store.  The help is super friendly and bends over backwards to help you find what you are looking for.  There is a large selection of very clean used items (many items look brand new).  I always feel like I am getting a super deal whether I am trading in or buying.  They really know their stuff!After becoming discouraged with three other shops, we stumbled across HOF and will definitely return!!  Ray had everything we asked for and was willing to share knowledge on products.  Five stars easy!!Pistol Parlour is a great place to shop. Not only is the staff very helpful and friendly (which can be rare in the firearms industry), but they have a huge selection. They know their stuff. I told them that I didn't want to spend $500 on EOTech optics they made some great recommendations on some less expensive options. I normally get the "EOTech is amazing, every else is crap" speach from gun stores. 

I often go in to just look around and see what's new. They are always friendly. Keep up the good work.Great place for breakfast! I ate this skillet that was pretty hearty with bacon, sausage, and ham. The potatos were really crispy and top it off with the eggs, you got yourself a great breakfast! 

My girlfriend got the eggs Benedict which was really tasty! That was there special so I'd recommend that if you go there. 

Both dishes were really tasty and you can tell the quality of food is great! Its not a Dennys or Carrows thats for sure, this is a nice mom and pop type of restaurant that makes really good quality of food. 

If your in the area do stop by because you wont regret it. The portions were really great and thats always a plus for me! But someone ordered french toast by me which also looked great also!

It looks like they have a lot of different things to eat that I bet will taste good! Check it out you wont regret it!This place rescued my mother more than once over the years and were very helpful to me when I needed extra keys made and when I had questions about how to operate the "keyless entry" lock on the front door.  I had the combination but needed the technique and they gave me enough suggestions that I was able to figure it out.  My worst fear was that I would lock myself out and not be able to get back in if I couldn't work the combination.  Thanks for all your help guys!Dropped in last minute on saturday to get a gel mani & pedi. Completely became a fan right off the bat. Friendly staff and it was definitely warm and inviting! I was fit in quickly and was able to get a super incredible gel manicure def one of the best! Highly recommended! The color selection is unlike any other place I've ever been. You can actually show up with out a polish and know you will be able to find a shade you want. The pedicure was just absolutely amazing! Hands down! Luv luv luv this cute and clean salon! 

This place really pays attention to the fine details and the staff is super friendly and funny. I had such a great time getting my nails done. I'll definitely be back soon!Lee Lee is more than an Oriental Supermarket... it's international.  They have aisles of things from South America, Africa, and Great Britain in addition to the expected Chinese, Japanese, Indian, Korean, Vietnamese, and things from other Asian countries.

I found some Dutch things there that I had not seen outside of the Netherlands, and some things from South America that a friend from Dominican Republic would bring home with her.

The place is huge, and always crowded.  In this case, crowds are good.  I am always able to get help finding things I need from other shoppers who can read the Chinese and Japanese labels.

They have restaurant in the corner.   Walk behind the low wall  on the north side of the building and through the door into the seating area to find a counter that has light fare.  That's were you can find the boba drinks.  Boba rulz!I highly recommend taking this course. It may be expensive, but it's hard to put a price on driving skills that could save your life or the lives of your friends/families. For how much time we all spend in cars, it sure doesn't hurt to have superior command of your vehicle.

I learned a lot in my course. For example, I learned about weighting the individual tires of my car, particularly through a turn. I also got experience steering out of a "black spin." Sure the odds of getting into a situation like this are low, but I like to think that I will remain calm and return my vehicle to safety should I ever find myself in this position. 

Also, it's fun! I still think of Bondurant skills today -- years after taking the course -- and hope that I can do the program again in another 10 years or so. Highly recommend!!Truly a 5 star experience. Iv been to LOTS of nail salons,  probably over 100. This by far is my favorite. Its family owned/operated. The staff speaks English and totally caters to what the customer wants. Special requests are welcomed. Iv been to so many nail, salons that want to charge 5 dollars for this and that and everything in between. You can't beat the prices here and they're work really is quality. Lots of options (tips, crystals, etc). I wish they were in Santa Monica,  but I will definitely be coming here when im in Arizona.  A+ .I love this place!!! A variety box of brownies was given to my company as a gift for Christmas. I tried the double chocolate and was immediately hooked. I managed to cut myself off though and bring half of the brownie home to my hubby. He absolutely loved it! That is saying a lot as he is very picky when it comes to his brownies. He didn't even like Fairytale brownies and I will admit, Fairytale has nothing on The Brownie Connection. I bought him 3 more a couple weeks later and he devoured them saying each time that he was pretty sure its the best brownie evar! I love how cute and small this place is and the mother daughter team that owns it are very sweet and friendly. A little pricey for a brownie as most of these bakery's are. However, I will splurge on occasion for my hubby since he loves them and I concur with him that they are great.

Update: OMG, just read on their website that the team that owns this place is retiring. There is no where to even shop on their website. I think they may no longer be in business. I am completely devastated! Just when I became a fan too!Gotta have the fries!  Specials are amazing, pizza is delicious!Great lunch specials at $10 or less and a massive amount of food. I alternate between the Sakana Lunch and the Chicken Matsuri. Today I had the Chicken Matsuri lunch. It came with two big peices of sliced up chicken cutlets with this teriyaki like sauce (almost like katsu), salad with shrimp tempura, california rolls and a side of rice. One plate is enough to feed two and only $8.99 during lunch. 

I also came here with some coworkers one night last week. They have customer appreciation (happy hour) on sun-thurs til 9:30pm! Buy a beer and get an appetizer for 50 cents. Also a decent list of rolls for under $5. To sum it up, good food and nicely priced.What a great place.  Cash only folks, so be warned!  They do have an ATM at the front but you will have to pay the fee.

The food is terrific, and ranges from sandwiches to meatloaf dinners to Mexican food.  They also do a killer breakfast.  They have daily specials and they make pies fresh daily.Fantastic quality and customer service. I have nothing but great things to say about Spa Lamar, and it's my "go-to" place for massages. I fully recommend them for a quality and well-valued massage. It's worth it. Great location just north of Fashion Square. The staff is extremely friendly and accommodating. They will explain everything, especially if it is your first massage.Friendly service. Plus the food came out pretty quick even tho they were packed. LOVE the Pesto Eggs Benedict!! Pesto sauce instead of hollandaise is an interesting twist! :) The pancakes are surprisingly good here! Most chain restaurants like IHOP or Denny's have pancakes that are tough, or bland, or chewey. The ones here are nice and fluffy w/ good flavor. :) I also like how they leave a pitcher of water and coffee on your table, that way you don't have to flag someone down to get a refill! :) 
I will definitely be back. :)The store itself is a bit expensive. They do have some great things you don't usually see in a cooking store however. 

But the reason I am giving them 5 stars is for their awesome cooking classes. I took a saute and sauces class and thought it was great! It was 60 dollars and 3 hours and the very next day I went to their website to look for more classes I would enjoy. 

The class was about 15 people, we cooked about 7-8 dishes and then got to try them all. The chef who taught this particular class was very nice and helpful and she absolutely made me want to sign up for future classes.Such an amazing store! I could walk around here for hours. I bought pieces from here when we moved, customer service isn't outstanding here but I love what I got so much I just looked past it. Just good tip to know all furniture has to be ordered and delivered to your home so you don't get your pieces the same day. And the other downside is that you have to pay $125 delivery fee which isn't bad as long as you are placing a large order, just make sure you wait and get everything at once instead of doing separate orders so you don't have to keep paying for the delivery feesRobert is awesome, he did my wedding tux and all jeans! Perfect every time!!A friend told us of this restaurant, so we drove 40 minutes south to Scottsdale (worth every minute). This is authentic Italian, homemade pasta ravioli to die for! I had the pork chop, delightful! We have been back once and have scheduled to go again with 3 friends, who have never been. All within 10 days!! It is worth the drive no matter how far!!Well, it's about time I got around to writing a review of my favorite neighborhood mexican restaurant.  Within about a minute you'll get fresh chips and salsa and Cadillac Margaritas, if you like.  Some of the best enchiladas I've ever had are my usual, and fresh jalapenos (not pickled) are readily available if you're a wee bit more daring.

Sit at the bar and enjoy a new HDTV screen and watch some football; special tip after those jalapenos: head over to your favorite gelato place ;)My favorite Mexican restaurant in North Scottsdale.  I wish they had a different location.  It's kind of hidden.  

Love the chicken burrito with Queso fundido..Best Sashimi and Sushi in the Area.  Excellent Service in a warm neighborhood setting.  Don't Miss it.My daughter had been quite sick earlier in the year and her pediatrician referred us to Arizona Astman & Allergy. She has since been diagnosed with asthma and after a scratch test turns out she is allergic to just about everything out here. She is on a regimen of medications to manage her asthma and allergies. It is amazing how much better she is doing. She plays soccer about 8 months out of the year so she is constantly being exposed to things she is allergic to and doing a lot of running. She is playing harder than she did last year and I can't help but give Dr. Jorgensen credit where credit is due. The only thing about our initial visit that seemed strange was just how long it took the appointment was taking. I found out before we left that the reason it took so long was because there was a patient having a severe asthma attack that had to be treated right away and then sent to the ER. This is not a complaint by any means. In fact, it is reassuring that if I were in there with my daughter under those circumstances it is comforting to know that she would be taken care of.I went to the melting pot for the first time for valentine's day with my boyfriend.  It was delicious!  Our server was incredible.  She was very attentive to our needs and made us feel like we were her only guests that night.  I noticed the manager going to every table and thanking them for choosing the restaurant.  Talk about personalized service!  They have these special enclosed booths that have a curtain.  It is defintely a romantic spot.  You have to have the artichoke dip.  It was the best I've ever had.Aladdins is the diamond in the rough. In fact we're getting take-out tonight!

The inside of the place is all the things everyone mentioned...but the FOOD! Oh, the FOOD. It's to die for.

I do like it better when his salad isn't as spicey, and I am in love with the garlic sauce that comes with the chicken shwarma. His hummus is the best in the city. I promise. 

Sadly, our other mediterranean choice Sabuddy's is gone so Aladdins doesn't just gets some of our business, it gets ALL of our business! At least when we have a hankering for mediterranean.

John & his wife are good people. They talk to you, they know you. When I was pregnant I don't think I ever went in (hubby did instead) & then one day I showed up to pick up an order & he asked me where I'd been!!!! Umm..gestating. Thanks for asking!  Then there was the day his produce shipment was late - so he was shopping at the grocery! Asked about our family and always has a smile. These are very hard working, honest people. 

Word to the wise: Do NOT eat if you're going on a date or need to make a good impression - you WILL stink like garlic! The stuff is strong! My husband used to try & hide that he went without me until he realized he brought the evidence home.I am from the east coast so I know my way around a bagel shop. This is literally the  BEST bagel place in Phoenix. Crunchy crust, soft chewy center, toppings piled high. I would go every single weekend if it weren't a bit far. *owners: open a Tempe location please ;)Great sports bar! Plenty of TVs, indoor/outdoor seating, full bar, fair selection of beers on tap and bottled. The atmosphere is what you might expect of a sports bar- loud. So don't come here if you want to enjoy conversation. But on the plus side, if you have loud children, this is one restaurant where it is no problem. Also, service is fast and friendly, so no waiting when the kids are reaching nuclear detonation. Food is good, no complaints. The skillet brownie is worth skipping dinner altogether.Fabulous experience here. We went during the summer, so it was off season. The price for what you get was outstanding. 

We had the bed & breakfast package, the breakfast was great, you can choose off the menu in the restaurant. Not some cheesy buffet that other hotels offer. 

Room was spacious and clean, lots of toiletry iteams available, that you can have delivered to your room, complimentary.

The large pool area was soooo nice, there is even some ledges in the pool that allow you to sit in and cool off. 

The only downside, was that the 30' slide closes at 5 pm.

I would highly recommend this resort.We were craving Chinese take-out and randomly found Qwik Chinese because it was close. We were very pleased with the discovery! The food was incredible and tasted much better than the name would imply :) This food is leaps and bounds beyond your typical take out. We got a few small entrees as well as fried rice, it was a ton of delicious food for the price.Close to restaurant perfection. 

Expect a long wait, but well worth it. BBQ chicken pizza = amazing. Pizza cookie is incredible. Service has never really been lacking. I've been back many times and will continue to do so.Yep. Always good.
 Did slices again today, instead of ordering a whole pie. Reallly good. Dare I say as good as a whole pie?

My ONLY complaint,  and I've resisted the urge to say this before, is the napkins. I really hate those cheap napkins. A good place deserves good napkins. I'm messy and I know it!

PS- thank you for always having football on when we come, it appears Sunday is our Ray's day.It took me 4 tries but I finally found my mani/pedi spot.  Whoohoo!  Scottsdale Nails is a great find.  They are super nice and everything is very clean.  (A new set of tools is opened for you when you sit down.)  My pedicure was fabulous, the application was great and has been lasting for quite some time.  The manicure is good, it doesn't last quite as long as the place I used to go to in Boston but you can get a good 10 days out of it.  Best of all?  Two huge racks of Essie polish! Finally a place here that satisfies my need to have understated nail color and not walk around with garishly bright nails.  The price for the mani/pedi was just what it should be, $35.  They work quickly, but not too quickly that the end product is shoddy.  They only do cash tips and get very busy so I would definitely call for an appointment.Not too long ago I was pulling out of my garage and noticed water bubbling up through the landscape rocks in my front yard. I got out of my car to investigate. I consider myself fairly handy so I did what any respectable guy would do, I started to dig. As I dug I noticed that the seepage was coming from somewhere under the concrete driveway. BIG problem. I knew this could be very bad and I was out of my league. As a new resident in this community I walked over to a neighbors house and she recommended her regular plumber whom I promptly called. This particular plumber admitted that front yard leaks such as the one I described were not their specialty, and they recommended I call Ranch Plumbing. 

I called Ranch and spoke to Vince who told me he could come by that afternoon. He also told me that I should try to immediately turn off the water at the main line so the area they they will need to inspect is not a muddy mess when they arrive. As I arrived home from work later that day, I could already see someone in the front yard digging away. Then Vince came out from his van parked nearby and gave me a rundown of the situation. He said they can fix the leak without having to replace the entire pipe. The problem was an elbow joint that was not snug, however the rest of the pipe was in good condition. This was the best part - they could have made a lot more money off me by saying that the leak was under the driveway and the whole pipe needed to be replaced. In the end, the cost was less than $200 for what appeared to be about a day and a half of hard labor and some new PVC. I was expecting it to be much more. 

Before the work was complete, my yard was restored to the condition it was in prior to the digging. I really appreciated that as well. 

I am giving them 5 stars because I am used to getting raked over the coals by various home services professionals. This time I came away pleasantly surprised by their quick service, honesty, and integrity. 

Thanks!Best burritos I've had in ScottsdaleThis is without a doubt one of the best brew pubs in the valley. Their brews are excellent. They have a great vegetarian pizza, and The shrimp and goat cheese bruschetta appetizer is amazing. All of their dressings and soups are made from scratch, putting a foodie spin on traditional bar food.Hubby and I go there probably twice a month.We live in El Mirage so it's quite a drive. But today he took me and our 2 adult daughters there for my birthday.  The food is always great, as is the service. Today however my king crab (which I get every time)  was a little salty so I sent it back. The manager ( Grace ) came to apologize and proceeded to completely shock us w/ some excellent customer service skills. I did'nt think management like this existed anymore. We will definitely be going again and again. It's really nice to know that the place you patronize appreciates your business. Marriah, was our servers name and she was also very nice. By the way , neither of them knew it was my birthday which made what they did even nicer. Will definitely keep going there and would also recommend.After having a hip that was 'locked' finding Doc Dearth was a miracle.  He was gentle but effective and with three visits I feel amazing.  I was always one to run to Urgent Care and treat symptoms but having this experience has now made me realize there are other ways (and safer ways) to care for our bodies.  I'm very grateful for the Doc.Great $12 lunch to go! If you press it really tight, you can get 2 portions lunch :)I'm a big fan of this place. Hey, it's not much to look at, but the owner is super cool, and the pressing by her staff is very good. Who wants to get their clothes back (and men's suiting) with wrinkles pressed in?? I have gotten that from other supposedly high-end places. 

Unless you request it faster, dry cleaning usually is done by tomorrow after 2pm and laundry the day after.

This is not an inexpensive dry cleaning place, but it's probably middle of the road, and they have never messed up my clothes once...I've been here a few times as well as ordered out and it's been good all around. Wings and pizza are their specialty and I stick to both. Always good.Have brought all my clothes here, I have gotten alterations done here, and when I left some a shirt there for 60 days the owner called me and let me know, for 1 shirt! thats service.I was having Air conditioning problems for the last 2 weeks. Since it has been so hot i think that it put too much strain on the unit.
I called Bruce's on a recommendation. They came the very next day.
I did not have an emergancy,i just needed it to run fully well.
 So the tec came the next day , right on time i may add. He had the problem fixed in no time, with just a $69.99 service fee. That was 2 weeks ago and it is still running perfectly. Isn't that what we all want, the Air company to come auickly, fix the problem and not charge too much!
Bruce's is just that!  Thank you!What more can I say about Ted's that has not been said by everyone ?
If you like violence and prefer your food to be poked, prodded & charred, then this is the right place for you.  After the hot dog master took your order, your victim is then put into the grilling line.  You will get the satisfaction of seeing your hot dog being tortured into a grotesque but tasty form.  When it is done, you can ask the hot dog prep master to camouflage it with multitude of tasty condiments.  I highly suggest the home made chili or hot sauce.  Once you are done, go back to the line and go order some more doggy goodness.Ted's is the best, it really is. Charcoal cooked hot dogs, awesome onion rings, and loganberry. What's not to love?My wife and I have used Del Rey for a variety of dry cleaning needs. Each time the job was done well and ready for pick up as stated on the bill.

I was hesitant to get my suit cleaned here. Would they do a good enough job? I went ahead and had my suit cleaned and they did a great job at a better price and cleaning then places that charge more. I was very pleased. My suit will be taken back here to be dry cleaned when appropriate.

All items are $2.25. Laundered dress shirts that are pressed are less. I think the cost is 1.50 per shirt.

The staff is always propmpt and ready to serve. The last time I came in, I walked in and approached the counter and the manager (I assume) talking with someone else off to the side, apologized for the wait and someone would be there momentarily. I was waiting for roughly 20 seconds before a young lady assisted me. This shows that Del Ray is committed to their customers and getting them in and out as quickly as possible.

There are also  coupons available as you walk out from other businesses in the area. A great way to try something out or save a few bucks. My personal favorite coupon is the buy 1 blizzard get 1 free from Dairy Queen.Rose took excellent care of me today!  Great job, the place is clean, spacious and inexpensive compared to most. I'll be back for sure!I'm really surprised this place has been ripped so thoroughly in reviews. I've been here numerous times and I've been taken care of well.

At first I'd go for the severe cold and flu stuff, once being bronchitis. 
Years later I had more serious problems. 

The person who said you really never see a real MD is right. I'm not sure I ever saw a Dr. in all my times here, but that's not a real issue with me. Diagnose my illness and give me something to cure it.
If the custodian there could do that I'd be happy. 

I once went here not knowing what was wrong with me and a PA diagnosed it and gave me a ton of literature on the illness. I didn't fill the prescription she gave me and I cured the ailment with over-the-counter supplements she recommended. 

One reason I go here is because it's rarely crowded and I'm usually not in the waiting room long. 

I was recently told that I need to start going to a Primary Care doctor and develop a relationship there in case I need a referral somewhere. Urgent Care can't give referrals based on your insurance.

Maybe I'm just fortunate that I've had better experiences than others on here.I have been to A LOT of starbucks (Hey, there is one on every corner in Chicago!) but this one was memorable.  I was only visiting family for a week in Gilbert and probably visited this starucks more then I would care to admit in that week but they had my drink memorized and were extremely friendly.  No drive up and the parking lot can get a bit crowded in front of the starbucks but great inside.  Nice patio with 'misters' (I duno if that is correct terminology.  The little water sprayers to keep you cool) on the patio for days you want to sit outside.  This is a starbucks so I dont really have much to say about the food or drinks (you have all been to one.  You know what it's about) but this one never got my drink wrong.  The one by my house gets my drink wrong on a normal basis :/Very challenging golf course at a super competitive rate. The food is great and so is the happy hour. Staff is very friendly, very clean establishment.Richard had great customer service and accommodated our needs.Absolutely LOVED this dentist office. 

They were extremely friendly, got me in and out quickly, and the dentist herself was very thorough and sweet and walked me through my x-rays and explained everything to me.

Would recommend to anyone and will definitely go back!Golden Rice Express has become my favorite go-to Chinese restaurant! I was referred here a couple of years ago, and have been going ever since. 

It's a small place great for grabbing a quick bite or ordering take out and the food is always ready within 10 - 15 minutes. They also do delivery, but I've never experienced their delivery service since I live close by and am not lazy. 

Portions are large, food is really good and authentic, and the prices are cheap. They also get 5 stars from me for their excellent service - the guy who is always there (who I think is the owner) is super nice. I'd recommend trying their chicken with garlic sauce or sesame chicken.I've been here many times purchasing and/or returning items over the years. Recently purchased my remote start here and had some issues with the starter not working properly. I had NO difficulty going back and getting it fixed and eventually getting a brand new unit installed again. Install staff, Kelly, was awesome and put up with my constant questions.

I would not trust my electronics to anyone else.For Chinese food, THIS PLACE IS THE BOMB! It's not a fast food greasy take out joint!!! This is a little cozy spot, very low key but Oh man let me tell you the food is great! My kids get the beef broccoli and usually I'll get the sun devil chicken or the orange chicken with steamed rice, It's not over breaded and the meat is all white no skin! Soooooooooooooo yummy! Prices are super good too, very inexpensive meal! I promise! Abacus you rock!Ah, the go-to place for day drinking and ditching classes with my classmates in medical school. Future doctors of America, right here, baby! The menu offers standard Americanized Mexican food fare, but there's just enough variety to have something for everyone. On the days I thought it inappropriate to return to class smelling of beer, I would turn to the horchata -- fresh and delicious, every time. Like fricking clockwork. The food is fresh and, magically, not heavy. The salsa bar lets you dump on as much diarrheaogenic hot sauce as your asshole can tolerate, and the chips must be made fresh because nothing that good comes out of a bag.

Regretfully, I am virtually never in the northwest valley anymore, and have enjoyed the Caramba experience maybe once since graduation. This is tragic. Why can't Caramba force Mi Patio out and set up shop there?Love this place & all the staff here! Been going here for years and I couldn't ask for a better facility with such great people especially when I'm ill and need care! All friendly and helpful... Especially Keisha and Dr. Crystal H!Great dinner with friends.  Michael and I enjoyed the Blue Moon special, blue fin tuna fresh that morning from Spain.  The most delicious roll Michael and I ever tasted!After trying a great many different Chiropractor's over the years, we have finally found one that works... and works very well. My wife has suffered for years with a nagging back pain. You know the kind... the kind that just seems to be persistent. 
Dr. Jensen didn't fix it in one visit like so many Chiropractor's promise, however over the the course a a few weeks the pain has come quite manageable and my wife is finally able to lead a normal life. It seems the only real pain now is me being a pain in the butt to her. Thanks Dr. Jensen.Loved this place!This place rocks! We had the corned beef hash and eggs with home fries and was served a platter covered wall to wall with food. The hash was excellent! Ordered a side of their spicy homemade breakfast sausage patties and it was AWESOME, the best I've ever had ANYwhere! 

We are definitely looking forward to our return to PHX Metro to experience them again!Go late at night, get Marshall (?...skinny, long dark haired kid) as your server and order a big ass cheeseburger. I don't remember the name of it, as it was on a menu insert and not a regular menu item...a cheeeburger with a fried egg, hashbrowns and cheese sauce on it. My God, one of the best cheeseburgers I've ever had. 

My friend's food was delicious as well, service was attentive and FAST...it was a packed house and everyone was having a blast. 

Having survived many after-club, overflowing and understaffed Denny's during my lifetime this one was a revelation (well, as much of a revelation as a Denny's can be).Since I was a child, Wor Wonton Soup has been a requirement any time I am not feeling well. The other night I had the flu, and being new to the area I was stuck without a favorite Chinese food destination.

I took to the Internet and pulled up Yelp. Little Dumpling was 15 miles away, but had the best ratings. Man am I glad I took the drive. The Wor Wonton was excellent -- definitely hit the spot. I also had the cashew shrimp -- I ordered a small and it was still enough to share (with the soup).

I arrived to pick up the food a few minutes before it was ready - and was surprised to see spring rolls in the order which I hadn't asked for. I guess that's their way of saying "sorry you had to wait" -- Great service. 

Good food, good prices, good portions. I will certainly be back soon.LOVE, LOVE the Spicy Korean Chicken!! Great quality + cheap food = a great meal :) . Next time I have to try the Loco Moco.....I've been to this location in the past.  Great service and equipment.  I will definitely be going back.  I have recommended Lenscrafters to others based on speed, thoroughness, explanation of benefits, and selection (although not as varied at the Henderson location).Awesome food and service!Oh my goodness did I shop today! Used some gift cards that I got for my birthday. I was on a mission to buy summer jeans and bras and such. One of my favorite stores is Bebe so I went there first and found a fab pair of red pants. I never wear red pants. However, these pants are HOT. So I do now....

Then off to Victoria's Secret. I received a gift card for my birthday from my good friends Leah and Mike. Not really a fan of VS. Stuff never lasted very long for the money and usually there are 17 year olds who could care less so I stopped shopping there about 10 years ago. Well today was another day. The person who helped me actually knew what she was talking about. Her name is Jamie. I literally hurled questions at her and she never skipped a beat. I showed her my Calvin Klein seamless undies and said look at these gems, they are 10 years old and I paid $30 a piece for the 6 pair I have. That's what I'm looking for. Keep in mind it is a madhouse in this joint because of the semi-annual sale. She spent a good 20 minutes showing me this and that. I spent $120. I mentioned to the manager on the way out that I never spend $40 on a bra and today I did that twice because the salesperson was on it like a stamp on a letter. Her name is Jamie. Victoria's Secret at The Galleria on Sunset. Oh and I bought 5 pairs of seamless undies too.....

Will update after a couple of washes...... ; )I come here so often, I probably pay their electric bill. Lol Always an awesome meal with great service. Lots of food for low prices. No complaints here & the Pad Thai & Wonton Soup are always my go to choices :) Definitely recommend to anyone who wants to find a new "Hole-in-the-Wall" kind of places!Jerry's Nugget is a great place to eat and play!   I always make of point of going there when Im in Las Vegas. The employees are super nice and the atmosphere is relaxed.....well as relaxed as a casino can be. Prices are very reasonable!I'm giving this place 5stars because I had a great time. I went to Vegas this past weekend for the canelo fight. So it was very packed, I'm talking about an hour to two hour wait. I have never had so much fun waiting to be seated everyone outside was drinking and some were dancing to the musicos. While waiting i had a michelada which is not my drink of choice but i was treated so i complied. When we were finally seated I ordered the mojarra frita which was sooo good and buttery. Then my cuzns and I where bought 2 buckets of beer and a bucket of flowers which was very sweet. 
We came back the next day because of how much we liked it. It's a must now every time we come to Vegas!!very fast and friendly, clean and courteous, considering how busy they are on black fridayOne of the best Italian places in the Vegas Valley area (for me, it's right up there with Nora's and Casa di Amore). Most times I'm in here, Gaetano and/or his wife are walking around talking to diners, seating people, taking orders, or monitoring the kitchen activities. Most of the servers are their sons or other family members. The dining room is big; I almost never make a reservation, and even so I've been able to get right in with 1-3 other people on Friday & Saturday evenings without a wait. The food is always amazing, and unlike some other places where the "specials" are old food they're trying to get rid of, Gaetano's specials are things he's been able to get a hold of and offer in limited supply, or just something he felt like making on a whim that day. There are always around 10 specials daily, and the waiters are amazing in their ability to rattle off every one of them with every ingredient and preparation along with it. I've never been let down by their food or their service. It's definitely more expensive than the Olive Gardens of the world, but it's totally worth it, and I can usually get 2-3 meals out of any pasta dish I'd order there. They also offer deals on Restaurant.com that you can use once a month and help you to savor their deliciosity without making your wallet too sad.

Some of the best things I've had here are their penne a la vodka (I'm a sucker for a good vodka sauce, and theirs is one of my favorites); a special that pops up every so often that's pappardelle pasta, filet mignon tips, and shiitake mushrooms in a marsala sauce; a caprese-type salad made with burrata instead of mozzarella cheese (frequently on the list of specials); and their eggplant parmesan. When they offer fish dishes, they're always very fresh (I haven't ordered one myself but my mom has gotten fish the couple of times she's come here with me, and of course I always snag at least one bite of everyone else's dish at the table... if you dine with me, prepare to share the love!). They have a good-sized wine list with both by-the-bottle and by-the-glass options. The bread you get in the beginning with olive oil & balsamic is so good I have to stop myself from eating too much & spoiling my dinner. I always leave here fat & happy.One of my favorite Italian restaurants in Vegas. I've gone to Tuscany Grill for years... even since they were at their original location on Sunset. The food is really good, but the service is what makes them exceptional. Lou, the owner, is the nicest guy and gives the place a real family feel. The waiters are really friendly and provide great service.

The atmosphere makes it great for a date or family dinner, but if you are into sports there is a nice sports bar with video poker.Dr. Downey is the best pediatrician in Las Vegas. Believe me we have tried several. My four children have been seeing him now for 3 years and I couldn't be happier. I only wish I had found him sooner. He is amazing with my children! He is always willing to listen to any concerns you may have and will quickly address them. He is the perfect mix of caution and common sense. His bed side manner is truly comforting and friendly, a plus considering how much time we spend there. I trust him completely with my childrens health and wellbeing.  Dr. Downey is the only pediatrician for this family!I am one of those weirdo girls who hates shopping. I would rather have a  tooth pulled than go to a mall. Okay, it's not that bad, but close.

This is the only Kohl's location I will go to in town. The one in Galleria Mall seems to not have the selection that this one does and the one on Charleston doesn't have the friendly staff.

That said, I love their return policy, I completely adore their staff who are always friendly and personable when I check out. Plus: KOHL'S CASH?! Shut the front door - AWESOME!This place could not be more different than the Strip Vegas most visitors are used to.

Fortunately a friend who's a local knew about this place, tucked near downtown and the Palace Station. The hotel looks like an old-school 50s or 60s-era motel that's been completely revamped and re-hipped. 

The lobby is filled with an eclectic collection of...stuff. And the ceiling is covered with classical art pieces. The bar is dark and sexy and awesome. It's what I imagine a hipster bar in Hollywood would be like (if I ever drove the 40 miles to Hollywood) with the added bonus of NOT being in Hollywood! The people there seem down-to-earth and not pretentious. The music on the Saturday we went was awesome -- a DJ spinning trippy, loungy, cool electronic music (a refreshing break from the throbbing club music of our previous nights at clubs on the Strip).

The martinis are pricey at $14 but exotic and worth it. I wish I could remember what mine was, but it was purpley-pink and delish. I was tempted to get the absynthe one, but lost my nerve!

I didn't get to check out the rooms, but I would definitely, definitely like to stay here sometime. And if I ever want a quickie Vegas wedding, this place would top my list.We used them just for the bridal bouquet and the bridesmaid's flowers, so we were a very small order. They made us feel very special and important none the less. The flowers were just gorgeous!!!  They found practically the exact color of the bridesmaids' dresses to use as the wrap around the flowers.  They were very professional and a pleasure to deal with!!!so being a smoker Dottie's is one of the cheapest places in Las Vegas to get cigarettes  today I got a pack of Marlboros and a pack of pall malls for under $7

yes it does look like a grandma living room but I also win money every time I go in there the drinks are comped and they have great snacks it doesn't matter what time of the day or who's on shift they are always super friendly and welcomingWhenever my friends and I visit Vegas, we have to come to Aloha Kitchen. The adobo omelette is sooo good and so large it's ridiculous. How I wish there was an Aloha Kitchen in San Diego so I could eat an adobo omelette everyday.First time here and definitely coming back. It's packed, and on a Monday. Was not impressed with the limited menu at first but quickly realized there were dishes listed on the wall.  A lot of them.  We sat near the kitchen which gave me a chance to eye out dishes I'll try in the future.  Service was quick, and the food came out quick which helps the crowd turnover.  Speed did not impede on quality.  Started off with the fire roasted eggplant and cold baby bokchoy. Both were refreshing.  Ichiza's ramen dx did not disappoint. Neither did an inexpensive and satisfying shrimp tempura bowl, served over a bed of rice and tempura flakes.  Of course, do not leave without a serving of honey toast.when recently in vegas for my 29th birthday, i had a mission. to go to an old time glitzy vintage vegas steakhouse for my birthday dinner. so i looked around on the internet and it led me to the golden steer.

now don't be fooled by the area that it's in, this is old vegas style. i just loved the huge fiberglass steer on the sign! the minute we walked in i knew we had come to the right place. dark, swanky, huge naugahyde booths with a western theme, a piano player in the bar... oh yeah. 

as soon as we were seated the lovely hostess gave us a total history of the place. who used to dine there, who's table was who's (we were at betty grable's table), what was good to drink, etc. she was super friendly and personable. she also clued us in that this was infact the oldest restaurant in vegas.

to eat we ordered the salad, the filet, a twice baked potato, and the chicken of the angels. all were very good. pricey but good. the server was totally old school and very attentive. a table next to us ordered the bananas foster for dessert and it was quite fun to watch it being prepared at their table. we would have ordered dessert too but we were both way too full and even took home leftovers.

after dinner we had a drink in the bar and watched the piano man play. i requested a few old tunes and he loved that i knew old music. a guy sitting watching the piano man kept talking about how he had just visited his friend, dennis hopper (the actor), earlier. i guess this place still attracts the well to do and hollywood types.

all in all it was a perfect vintage birthday dinner and now it will be a tradition whenever we are in vegas. they made me feel like i was a old hollywood movie starlet!YUM YUM YUM YUM YUM!!!!!
I'm not even from Vegas and I heard about Capriotti's since it's famous amoung the locals. Now I can see (and taste) why! I loved LOVED my mushroom cheesesteak with grilled onions and peppers! Soooo freakin' good! 
I just wish they had one here in the Bay Area, specifically somewhere across the street from my job....
Damn I'm craving Capriotti's right now as I write this review!Awesome sandwiches! I got the 6 inch turkey and had a hard time finishing it because it was so packed full of meat. Definitely worth dropping by this place for lunch.This was my First time here after being recommended by my brother. Upon entering I had a sense that the food was going to be good judging by how busy and packed it was in here. I Ordered the meat jun, I've had meat jun at other places and this is probably the better ones I've had. I liked how side dishes were served unlike other places I've been to, which I will not mention. Based on their food and service alone, this place deserves 5 stars. Island style has got to be Las Vegas best kept secret since they've been here for a while now and I've never heard of them until today. I will definitely be returning to their other selections.Definitely a dive bar, but still one of my favorite places! Drinks are cheap and karaoke with Danny G is awesome. My only gripe is the one toilet for the girls--you gotta plan your pee breaks in advance!Best pizza in Vegas... Best wings in Vegas... Fastest delivery in vegas when guy in black corolla delivers, always nice! LOVE LOVE LOVEAwesome Food, a group of 4 of us went in for the first time and they treated us like family.I should preface this by saying that I'm Thai and I've been to a gazillion Thai restaurants.  This place has to be one of the best I've ever been to, and it was in Vegas of all places??  If it wasn't for yelp and having a vegan friend in company, I probably would have never stumbled upon this place. 

From the moment we walked in, we were immediately greeted with a friendly smile from who I assumed to be the owner.  Their customer service was EXCELLENT.  They gave recommendations to my friends who wanted something more beyond the overdone Pad Thai and Pad Se Ewe.  They came back to our table several times to make sure everything was perfect.  The food here is authentic and tastes like great home cookin.'  

I'll be the first to admit that not all Asian/Thai restaurants are very friendly (or at least that's what I've encountered over the years) but Komol has great customer service and understands that being polite and cheerful with your customers really goes a long way.  Komol will now be my home away from home the next time I'm in Vegas.So this time the nurses and doctors were all super amazing and quick and sooooo professional and friendly  very happy with my visit especially since I was kind of embarrassed for my reason of coming here. (Weird rash on my thighs) he took one look at me and knew what was wrong instantly and wrote me a prescription and sent me on my merry way.What a bargain!!! The price is low already, and if you look out for coupons in the mail: Katy bar the door! I think I ate half my body weight in pepper shrimp. I went for lunch and from what I heard this is nothing compared to the dinner, I shall have to return and find out for myself, I may, however need someone to roll me out when all is said and done, or in this case eaten. Live it up you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!First off I'm reviewing their lunch specials because this location I eat when I'm craving Thai food during my lunch break. (I usually go to Pin Kaow 2 which is closer to my house SEE THAT REVIEW FOR MORE)

The atmosphere here is very pleasant, dim lighting and authentic decor down to the servers. The service here is amazing, the servers are sweet and very attentive. So back to lunch, 7.95 for your choice of either pork, beef, chicken, or tofu or 8.95 for shrimp or squid. I love their lunch specials because for 7.95 (dine in) you get to choose from the top 10 most ordered dishes that come with a side of rice, daily soup, egg rolls, & fried wontons. ALL THAT for $7.95 what a great deal! I absolutely love Pin kaows chain of restaurants. They have 3 locations in Las Vegas which makes it so convenient for people to come on in and try their food! I'm Thai and this place hits pretty close to moms home cooking.One of the nicer selections of larger sized clothes I've ever sen!
 Some are got older peeps, but a good cross section of hoodies, etc.
 Bras, in larger sizes on sale for $10!
 They were friendly, and helped us, let us take extra clothes in the try on room.
 Will be a regular, after I get a job. Heh.There prolly is some really fancy awesome nail salon somewhere in summerlin that does a phenomenal job and is way better than my ghetto little nail place BUT you can guarantee they will charge you an arm and a leg to do that. I like this little salon. Maybe they don't do the best of the best but they are good enough for me and my pocket. I am simple so a lil gel manicure with French tips and same for my pedi and a wax for my eyebrows and I'm out the door within two hours :) feeling like a princess :)I was really surprised to see this wonderful team has only one review on yelp!
They deserve way more, so here's my contribution:

I was lucky enough to find Paradise Auto Body after I nastily got rear-ended at a stoplight. Then my AC was out and I knew where I was going to take care of it.

This is a family-owned, friendly, honest, professional, quick and comprehensive body shop! These people know their stuff! Their prices are reasonable, they'll tell it to you like it is, and even clean your car after a repair. 

Thank you Jackie, Jesse, Ashley and everyone else at Paradise, for taking care of me and my car! I'm seriously going to miss you :)The local spot! CLEAN, friendly and quick food. My  favorite is the #4 on the menu, they also have very good carne asada nachos, not so good chicken nachos. The chicken is shredded (boiled) and flavorless, maybe if they dice and grill it. The food is fresh and affordable! Now if they could serve margaritas, it would be my weekly stop.Hondatronics is the bestI'm from out of town and on our first day of celebrating a bachlorette party our mechanism on our window broke. I called James and we were in and out in a little over an hour. He was honest, fair price and very helpful. Thank you James for not letting this ruin our trip to Vegas. This place is awesome!!!!!!I love this place so much. Their rice is a thing of beauty. I've been coming here for years and have never had a bad experience. It's very small but there always seems to be a clean table available. Staff is very friendly and helpful. Food is consistently delicious and my husband loves their baklava.I just wanted to say I love/hate Trader Joes right now. 

Sooo I saw a bag of mini Stroopwafels (they're butter waffle cookies with caramel/syrup in the middle) and I love these things so I grabbed the small bag of these.

We got home and the bag is empty. 

Yeah.....Since Tenaya Creek Brewery doesn't serve food, we ordered delivery from Northside Nathan's, which is nearby.  After browsing the menu, we decided to get a Large 1/2 Guys & Dolls (Sausage, Pepperoni, Onions) & Veggetarian (Onions, Peppers, Mushrooms, Tomatoes, Olives).....$24.  They told us 45 min to 1 hour.....not bad during the Super Bowl.

The food didn't seem to take long to deliver.....we anxiously tore open the box and started to dive into it....it was very very good!  The crust is thick like Sicilian style Pizza and is fluffy and full of flavor.  The Pizza is square-cut and holds the toppings well on the crust.  It hit the spot!

Easily one of my favorite Pizza & Sandwich joints in town.

Return Factor - 100%I was going to eat at Quiznos next door, but decided to try Yummy's...and I'm very glad I did. I've lived in Vegas for 3 years and had yet to find a "good" sushi place. Since I had never eaten there I was a little skeptical so I stuck to the "basic" rolls. I got the spicy tuna and a cali roll. They were SO fresh! The spicy tuna was by far the best I've ever had. I will return many times over! Can't wait to try something else....After hearing about this restaurant for a long while, I finally got out there with a few friends. It lives up to the hype rather well. Entering through their wine shop, we grabbed our red blend bottle and headed to the table on the patio (most of the seating is outside). The patio overlooks all that is Vegas and Summerlin: a fake lake with McMansions on the opposite shore. Nevertheless, most of us enjoy being close to bodies of water (however man-made), and I am no exception. The multilevel patio was constructed with care and dollars, and it makes for a great dining environment. We started our meal off with a cheese plate that offered five cheeses that covered a nice spectrum of fromage. From there, we went straight to the entrees. I had the roasted chicken. While I largely ordered the dish to have a lower-calorie option (which I am sure was still packed with cals), the dish turned out to be amazing - possibly the best chicken dish I have ever had. I also tasted both of my friends' dishes (steak frites and halibut), both of which were the cat's pajamas as well. The only dig I could offer is that the staff was not entirely personable. The host acted like it was a bit of a chore to seat us, and our server half-assed it. However, the manager did make his rounds and checked on us, which I always appreciate.By far the most consistent and best BBQ in the South West. I'm from the Midwest Omaha NE. & I have had the best from KC, Chicago, Omaha, Austin, Atlsnta etc. And I was astonished to find out the neon desert could compete in the BBQ arena now. Hence Roadkill Grill! My only gripe is that I live on the opposite side of town, but either way its always well worth it. 5 stars all day.The Island Pet Hospital is the best hands down. They have the CLEANEST facility I've ever seen and their staff is so courteous, helpful and super friendly. They make me feel like family, which is super important when trusting my animals care to someone. They are not expensive and are convenient to get to. They do everything and they board animals all at very competitive prices, and my dog always leaves so happy, I wonder if she misses me at all. I seriously love this place. No matter where I move in town this is my vet! 

I can't say enough good things about the doctors and staff and cleanliness. Its far superior to any vet I've ever been to in town or out of town for that matter. I never have wait times, and my dog loves it there. They treat her like she is a true member of their family. They are genuine, sincere and are knowledgeable most of all. They are always a phone call away and ready to help.close to my house and the shopping center this place is located in has a few places i like to go to regularly. they always have decent deals on stuff we are constantly needing. the sushi here is decent for what it is and the bakery is on point. they keep a really good stock of yogurt which i love. i have been on this greek yogurt trend also, and they have a really good selection of fruits and veggies..check em outAll I can even say is Dr. Askew is gentle and I was seen right at the time of my appointment with out having to wait like most offices. 
I left feeling relieved and wondering why I was so nervous in the first place.I was in las Vegas recently and was in desperate need of a massage and facial, so I looked at all the casino spas. Saffron came up in my search results and was significantly cheaper than the hotel casinos, so I thought I'd give it a try. Don't be deceived by the outside and the route to get there - I was apprehensive driving on the way but as soon as I walked in it was wonderful. The treatments were brilliant, my massage was one of the best I've ever had and everyone was so sweet. I highly recommend this place to everyone - skip the hotel spas and go straight to saffron!OMG I have never had this before and boy was I missing out!! The customer service was great, they were so polite to my boyfriend and I and even hooked me up! I ordered the mini corndog kids meal and they let me sub the desert pear drink for the fountain drink and curly fries for the reg fries (cause they hooked me up!) and it was the best corndogs I ever had! So impressed with this fast food! My BF got the junkyard dogs and they were super filling and good, I had a taste of the chili and it was great too! Will defiantly go back...

Best thing about this place...the desert pear lemonade drink. I am always looking for non carbonated, water substitutes when I'm out, because water and lemonade get really old when that is all you drink. This was sooo good, so so so so good! I am so impressed!

And side note they have an A rating from the Health district.

And another thing! I always order kids meals, because of the small portions (I don't eat much), but the toys are an added bonus. In recent years all toys suck from kids meals...until today! It was awesome! It's a nerf rocket!! Love it!Slightly uppity ambiance, but who cares, the food is so good. 
The service was awesome, we had a reservation, and arrived early, so we had a drink at the bar.  I'm not usually a fancy cocktail girl, but these fine tuned hand crafted cocktails aren't a bad thing. The bartender, Aaron, was really nice and seemed quite vested in his drinks. 
Our waiter was also awesome, he had some good advice, like the ribeye is a bigger portion than the rack of lamb, and even showed a bit of concern over just ordering a raviolo for my entree (I ate two other first courses though, hahaaa).
The food was delicious. I don't know if it's this local food thing, or preparations, but how come the ribeye just tastes like heaven? I was surprised to see that they had salt and pepper at the table, we didn't have to use any, everything was seasoned really well.
Also, can someone tell me why don't I live closer so I can try the changing raviolos on a regular basis? 
Anyways, everything was good. Make a reservation and go have a nice night out, it's so worth it.As a UW student I'm really proud of our Babcock ice cream however personally I would rank the chocolate shoppe as the best ice cream in town. Also they offer ice creams made for special nutrition needs including a variety of soy ice cream, which is really nice for ones with lactose intolerance.
If you prefer creamy flavors I would recommend green tea, as it is not overly sweet so that you can taste the milk thoroughly. Well, I'm not saying that it's a low calorie choice - as the prints on their dishes say, 'you want nutrition, eat carrots.' It's not the time to consider you daily carb and fat intake buddy,  it's the time to experience the best of America's dairy land.J Kinney did the flowers for my wedding back in October.  I still can't believe how beautiful they were.  I live out of town and didn't really know exactly what I wanted, although I did know that I wanted something modern, elegant and unique.  Jane had my style figured out right away, and delivered the most beautiful and unique bouquet I have ever seen.  It was exactly what I wanted, yet completely different than most traditional bouquets.  I'm so happy I worked with J Kinney, it was one of my favorite details from the whole wedding.My husband would give this restaurant 6 stars if he could :)  We enjoyed the breakfast and lunch we had here very much and highly recommend it!  Cool vibe too.Best burgers in Madison.You save lives! Enough said?

They have a professional staff that are kind and conversational that take you through the whole process. Since their staff are full time pros and not volunteers I've never had them miss a vein or have to do any significant adjustments or re-sticks.

There is always a need.Talk about a damn, fine breakfast. I was half starving after waiting for a Breakfast at my hotel that didn't happen. Before I collapsed of Starvation, the wonderful C.R. found Bluephies for us. 
There was a local Marathon that ended in the area, so we had to climb over all of the sore and crippled runners to get in the door. There was a short wait, but the hostess was nice enough to give us a couple of cups of coffee in the waiting area. 
The interior was beautifully decorated in a 80's style that would make Robin Leach smile. There are lots of windows, so the sunlight shined in beautifully. 
We had a wonderful server that kept us wired with coffee. I ordered the meat-lovers skillet which was filled with all kind of goodies that made my tummy happy. 
Bluephies is now our official Breakfast restaurant of Madison. I would not want to go anywhere else.I don't know why anyone would give this less than 5 stars. Who doesn't like karaoke? 

Ok, I guess the drinks are a little expensive, but that's for Madison prices. If you're a real adult or an out-of-towner, affording these drinks shouldn't be a problem. Also, sometimes you have to wait a while for your turn to sing, but that's what they sake bombs are for (and they'll make you sing better).Great experience! The staff was really friendly and they did a great job. There were 4 of us total and we all got done at relatively the same time. The staff was friendly and social and my nails look fantastic. I have gotten my nails done elsewhere in Madison and this is by far the best place I've been to. Very reasonable prices for an outstanding job.Dedicated to your eye health. Excellent doctors and care all around. I have normally seen Dr. Nelson but had the chance to see their newest addition, Dr. Radke.  She is outstanding.  Thorough, thoughtful, and very caring.  Can't recommend this group enough.If you ever live anywhere near Madison, you need to go to this place.  The bar in the stable serves drinks strong and perfectly poured.  Literally anything off the menu is going to burst with flavor.  The Stone House and the Stable Grill both offer really cool experiences; be sure to take a walk through the cool tunnel that serves as a wine cellar and connects the two.

I think Quivey's Grove is best enjoyed when you're planning to spend an hour or so at the bar waiting for a table, preferably on one of those cold winter nights where it's so brutal that you can't stand the walk from the car to the restaurant door.  Quivey's practically exists to keep you warm.Five stars for the amazing two person band that played there last Saturday!  They rocked Last Dance with Mary Jane and we had an amazing waitress who brought on the shots and beers!01/04/2012

I thank Yelp and ATC for giving me the great opportunity to experience a terrific performance of "Daddy Long Legs," ATC's first musical production, at The Herberger Theater tonight!  The two-actor (Megan McGinnis and Robert Adelman Hancock) musical, plus the invisible, but great assets, the orchestra and sound crew, entertained and amazed me w/ their execution of a well-written body of work.  It had comedy, romance, deception, and sorrow, to name a few... what's not to like?  Truly enjoyed McGinnis' impeccable timing, as well.  It is sad that many people pass up the opportunity to watch live theater due to the higher ticket fees, and I cannot fault them-- what's easier to bear: $37 per person plus $3 parking fee, which you may buy at the box office prior to attending the show, or $10 and free parking at the movies (well, at least when you're NOT catching one in downtown PHX)?  However, when you do decide to place the financial investment, you will almost always be rewarded w/ a highly-memorable night, believe you me!  

I had a wonderful time, and I would definitely recommend "Daddy Long Legs" to anyone who enjoys great acting and music!  (Much thanks to McGinnis and Hancock for their lovely harmonies-- I cherished them!)Southwest is my airline. 
I've always preferred them. 

There are no assigned seats, which is a curse and a blessing. 
A blessing in the case of showing up early you have your choice. 
A curse, if you run a hair late, you're split up. 

We are rapid rewards members, and have Chase Visa cards - which means we are frequently sent drink vouchers. I know this isn't a huge deal, but it makes us feel valued. Sometimes it isn't the dollar value of the gesture, but the casual reminder of "Hey we know you choose us, and we hope you continue to do so..." 

We've had pretty good luck with baggage, very few flights that require connections, and overall very kind staff. 

In fact, this last jump from Georgia to Phoenix, we had a snag at the drop off for the rental car, and arrived at the gate about 1 minute before they were going to close the doors. They had someone WITH OUR BOARDING PASSES waiting for us, so we could walk right on. We expected to be turned away, not be treated like royalty. 

Thank you for always getting us to and from safe Southwest.We went for our first trip this morning. When we drove by at about 9:45 a.m. it looked abandoned. So we were not sure if it was still operating. After waiting for a few minutes a few folks started arriving so we figured it will open soon. When it opened we were really surprised how many tables it held as it looks like it might fit three at best. Now mind you it is not huge, but larger than it looks. There were five of us and we fit well. We were greeted by a very nice young lady. In fact I would say this place has the cutest staff around. What I mean by that is they were all smiling friendly adorable folks.
We ordered our food and were attended to for drinks. Very large mason jars are used for the drinks and filled to the top. The food came. Four of us chicken and waffles and one had the rice and gizzards with gravy. We all loved the chicken, very tasty and quite crispy. Three of us liked the waffles, I being the dissenter. There was nothing wrong with them, it is just personal taste. I did not like the cinnamon added. We all took a bite of the rice and gizzards. Really good flavour with wonderful gravy. A good time had by all.WHOOOOOOOOOWEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!! that's some damned good fried chicken!

hahaha!! Forreally for real though... Ugh.... *Insert Homer Simpson-esque gargling sound here!* 

My cousin and I were spent the weekend being hermits and I got tired of it and offered her some LoLo's, never one to turn down a free meal, she happily said yes. We brought my mom along and were Lo-Lo's bound.

When we got there I saw the lil tent and mini bar of doom. I've read the many reviews warning me about Lo-Lo's 40+ minute wait... but seeing no one standing in the way of the misting fan, we decided to trudge on in... and we were SO lucky to find more empty tables than filled. We sat down in the nice cool mustered colored room, lined with Framed pictures depitcing the Jazz Era... 

We were quickly brought menus and we ordered a round of tea... I had the Half sweet & Half unsweetened tea... my cousin chose the sweetened tea and my mom the chose the unsweetened tea. When the HUGE mason jars hit the table they were excited! I held my own taste test and concluded that Yelpers are always right and that the half & half rules. 

Our waitress was nice enough to explain some of the dishes to us. We ordered and waited a lil while... not as long as I did the first time I went. While we waited and talked the rest of the tables around us quickly filled and we considered ourself fortunate to have arrived when we did. I told them of the warnings about going to Lo-Lo's after church on Sunday... Expect an hour long wait! They whistled and said that it couldn't be that good... 

and then the food arrived...

It was better than I remember it! i chose the Soul-food platter which comes with 3 pieces of fried chicken and your choice of two sides... I chose a waffle and smothered potatos and a large muffin type hunk of cornbread. My mom ordered the same thing but chose potato salad & yams as her sides. My cousin got a pair of drumsticks with a waffle. 

We were all silent for a good five minutes. When we finally went up for air. My mom couldn't believe how good her yams were. She looked like she wanted to cry! lol... and she said the potato salad was great and that the chicken was EXACTLY what she wanted!!  My cousin was inlove with the chrunchy-type crispness salty sweetness of the chicken & Waffle combination. and I, I was about to DRINK my smothered potatos, which are nothing but simply boiled potatos swimming in this basil-thyme(?) flavored chicken gravy that was sent here from heaven!! IT was the BEST gravy I EVER EVER tasted!! I was happily taking a bite of chicken with a bite of waffle and then followed it with a nice perfect smothered chunk of potato... when... when... it was GONE!! ARGGHHH!! When are they going to invent never empty bowls?!?! huh?! WHEN?!

There was nothing but small micro bits of potato swimming in the most amazing grazy... and all I had was a fork... but there... was still some left... and not a spoon in sight, but I could pick up the lil mini bowl.... 

"DON'T EVEN think about it!" My mom scolded me while reading my thoughts

DANG! 

I reached a happy medium when I got smart and skewerd a nice piece of chicken and dunked it in the gravy and I was SO back in business!! :D whoo hoo!! It was heaven. pure heaven. 

I know very few things about heaven... I know O'odham Cumbia in Heaven... and I know Lo-Lo's gravy is poured from FOUNTAINS in heaven!! haha.... 

Meanwhile - back on Earth, we devoured our food. I honestly thought I was going to have tons leftover for my lunch the next day... my mom thought the same... no such luck for any of us! My mom was in extacy over her yams that she asked for their recipe... the waitress said she'd ask and quickly came back with: brown sugar, cinnamon & vanilla - boiled and NOT baked... and that's it. And PLEASE let me tell ya'll - she has NEVER ever done that with me before... this woman doesn't like ANYTHING/BODY... and that day, she fell in love with those yams! (Where's my calender?!)

We were laughing and talking about how good the lemonade is (oh yeah - when I needed a refil, I just asked for some lemonade instead of more tea, she did it no problem... she also did the same for my cousin who tried the red kool-aid) and how great the food was when I got a call from a good friend of mine. I told him where I was when he made fun of me and told me to clog my artaries... I made a face and asked him in a rather rude tone if he's ever been to Lo-Lo's, he said no. And then I told him... he'll never get how little I care about my artieries when I'm here until he tries it for himself! Only until you try it do you get how amazing it is...

So simple, so devine. So yummy, so Lo-Lo's.After living in Flagstaff for over 10 years I have given up all hope of finding a barber/stylist that can give a decent fade, or any decent haircut for that matter.  But, luckily my fiance has family in Phoenix so I now have a reason to go there often enough to scout for god barbers. Luckily, I had to only go to one place...and that place is Twin's.  To be honest, Regina did such a fantastic job that I would have no problem going to PHX once a month even if that was the only reason. The place is decked out really nice and I had fun talking with the employees.  Regina and the other crew are the only people that touch my hair form now on. I can't wait to go back.This is a great little buffet. I have been coming here for years. The egg rolls are amazing.if you order lunch to go, you will eat for two or three days off of it.Friendliest and most talented nail technicians. This place is amazing, my friend and I have been coming here since middle school, up to our twenties now. I have been to different nail salons across the valley and I continually come back to Tommy's above all others. If you're looking to have  top notch, long lasting, and incredible nail work done, come to Tommy's.A review for Taco Bell - "this guy is nuts" you might say.  

I'm not going to lie, Taco Bell is a guilty pleasure of mine.  The food is good and cheap.  But, the thing that sets this restaurant apart from any other fast food restaurant is it's service.   A matter of fact, this place has better service then probably 90% of sit-down restaurants out there.  The staff is always friendly and extremely hospitable.  This may sound crazy - but go check it out and you'll be blown away.  

I'm trying to convince my HR department (I work in hotels) that instead of recruiting out of any other avenue - we need to go find where this Taco Bell gets their associates.  Must have great management.Came here with my friend who was having problems with his laptop and they give a free 15 minute diagnosis.  The guys there were great and spent plenty of time making sure everything was okay on his computer and after testing it and finding nothing wrong.  He suggested the problem was probably internet related with my friends home service.  Turns out he was right and it cost us nothing which is way to generous in my opinion.  I had to come on here and Yelp about it.  The place isn't fancy and is in front of the bowling alley on the NE corner of 35ave & Union inside the strip mall.  Check it out if you have a chance and skip the Geek Squad!I placed a claim under our home warranty and AZ Fire and Ice was dispatched to see why our heater wasn't blowing out hot air.  I submitted the claim on a Friday and that same day someone from the company called me to set up an appointment and had an availability that next day (Saturday) which was great.  Wade showed up right around 1pm (beginning of the 3 hr window) and took less than 15 mins to diagnose and fix the problem...the thermostat was set up incorrectly.  Whoops!  I'm glad we had a great first experience with our home warranty company and Wade was professional and nice. Thanks!on of the best bars in az great food drinks and good people and if you found anything wrong here then you were look for a 5 star 100 bucks a plate place.Can't say enough good things about this place. 100% the best there is when it comes to gyros. Fast service and very fresh. Had the normal gyro sandwich with their sauce...very good. 
If you want authentic greek food, you will get the best here.Awesome!!!!!  I had the gyros, then I could smell the kabobs.  I need to come back soon.After seeing all the positive reviews it was time to make a trip from Surprise, and WOW WHAT AN EPICUREAN DELIGHT! The owners made you feel so glad to see you and the food is authentic and very tasty. Had the Gyro "yeero" and it was stuffed with meat and not a lot of fillers. Plenty of meaty fries and a soda for only $6.99! I loved this place so much I brought my wife back 2 days later. We went with 2 different platters, one Chicken (oh so good) and Beef that had a huge portion served with a great flavored rice and veggies. The Hummus the owner said he makes fresh and daily. All the food tasted like it was prepared fresh. If you like or love Greek food you are missing the real deal if you don't visit this high quality low cost restaurant. KING GYROS IS THE BEST HANDS DOWN!The name says it all.   This lovely little store in Mesa probably has something that would fit anyone's taste.  It is divided into section by color, which is my favorite way to shop.  I was looking for green pillows for our couch and its so easy to just go over to the green section.  They even had a pink and green section that would have been wonderful two years ago when I was planning my wedding!  The selection is fantastic and is a nice departure from Pottery Barn and Crate and Barrel.  In addition to home decor Domestic Bliss also has a small section of women's clothing and jewelry.  Its moderately priced but it was all very nice and well chosen.  

This was really my first stop in reconnaissance for decorating our new condo.  I have a feeling I will be back for a few items that caught my eye.I spent 6 years in Germany and my buddy who was with me Friday night is German.
We absolutely loved the food. I had the lamb shank with the jäger (mushroom) gravy with the fried potatoes and red cabbage. A little Asbach to wash it down. Delicious.
My buddy had the Bauernschmaus which he loved. Made him a little homesick. 
The owner, Werner came out and said Guten Aben to everyone and asked how the food was. Just, a great experience.Since moving to Arizona, I have found it difficult to find "mom and pop" shops in the East Valley. Imagine my delight when a coworker directed me to The Bread Basket. This is a quaint, privately owned bakery that has excellent customer service and delivers a fantastic product. My husband and I chose this bakery to make our wedding cake and we were not disappointed. We ordered a three tier square cake. It was a marble cake with fresh raspberry filling...no fruit preserves allowed. It was delicious and beautiful, exactly what we had wanted. One of the owners, Brenda, delivered the cake to our venue herself. Since then, we order a miniature version of our cake on every anniversary and continue to enjoy the baking bonanza at The Bread Basket.Never had a problem with this Starbucks. They are as friendly as can be and the drinks are made perfect every time. Keep up the awesome customer service!I see Jim Allen for myopractics and massage, and he is amazing. I have seen a chiropractor before, but I definitely prefer the myopractics where soft tissue manipulation is used to balance your body instead of just cracking it back into place. It's a much more holistic and gentle way to restore your body to it's natural state of movement and relieve tension and pain.

His massages are equally amazing and the best I've ever had. He has many years of experience and education, and he is continually learning new techniques. 

If you are into energy healing and natural healing arts, you will love Jim. He can make you feel like a new person. Jim is amazing and genuinely cares about each and every client, and it comes through in his work. He also does cranial sacral and ayervedic massage and can incorporate specific essential oils to suit your needs.The is our favorite place for breakfast. We take everyone here when they visit from out of town. We've never had a bad meal out of all the times we've eaten here. I have been to several of the locations and they are all fabulous food and service wise. The lunch menu is yummy too! They offer some healthy choices as well which is always important!O-M-Goodness! What luck to have eaten here for breakfast!! Huge portions served with fresh fruit slices or mixed berries. Great service and very nice to sit on the porch under the heat towers as it was a cold morning. The only downside was there were so many good things it was hard to choose!Everything here rocks!  Excellent java...iced or hot and they will give you a roader...I had eggs over medium...cooked perfect with a nice buttery taste, a crazy great piece of grilled turkey...IDK what it was but so darn tasty, fresh fruit and the cranberry toast...oooo I want it now!!!
My mates had choc chip pancakes and they were tasty, fluffy and so yummy!  The home fries were awesome as well...this was a fantabulous foodtastic time!If I lived in the Phoenix area, I'd try to be a regular at this place. $3 ice-cold PBR, awesome live music (AKA REAL country-western), fun decorations, nice bartenders, and no pretension. It's a old-school western dive where one feels right at home...the kind of place where strangers smile at and laugh with one another. I've heard that you just about can't even get through the door during snowbird season, so I'm happy we were able to have a great time here TWICE last week. If you visit Scottsdale, you HAVE to stop here for a cold one, or four.Food was sooo delicious! Went in for lunch with a friend, had great service and great food. Waiter suggested a few good sushi rolls and they were so good that we asked for seconds! Also, its very beautiful inside the restaurant. Nice way to end our shopping trip in the fashion square mall at Kona Grill. Will definitely be going back. Thumbs up!I got the coconut shrimp sushi roll with macadamia nuts and mango. Very delicious and a bit sweet! I also got the simple tuna roll, which came with a bit more rice than I would have liked. Still fresh and tasty though.So far, this is the best place I've found in Phoenix (been here 5 weeks on business, eating out most nights).  This place is the closest I've come to finding a 'family run, no frills' restaurant similar to what I"m used to in the Bay Area (if there's one thing I'm tired of, it's the 'over-fancy' places in Scottsdale - let's focus on food, folks, not winning an architectural design contest!).  The veal piccata was great - thin and tender, as was the veal marsala.  The 'house made sausage' was also tasty (though a bit salty). The pita bread they serve on arrival is perhaps the best I've ever had - no idea why! And the salads were great too.  The cooked veggies served with the meal were super-fresh - another surprise.  

The service was friendly but not overbearing, and it was nice to see a place that is independently owned and been in business for 15 years.  If they could somehow move away from the rowdy drinking hole next door, life would be even better!  It is a tad on the pricey side, but typical for Scottsdale.The property is fabulous!  This is my third stay, and I can't say enough good things about the entirely friendly and professional staff, the grounds were impeccably maintained, the linens in the casitas were divine, and the spa spectacular.  If you want the best deep-tissue massage ever, ask for Mr. Stacy at the Centre for Well-Being.  He is an amazing massage therapist, you won't be disappointed.  I can't wait to go back.Beautiful hotel, great pool, nice restaurants, fantastic service, fabulous place to stay.The Phoenician, Scottsdale is a hotel that you don't want to miss if you are ever in the Scottsdale area. The grounds are immaculate and the service Starwood provides is spectacular. The hotel is part of Starwood's Luxury Collection of Hotels so expect to pay a premium for meals and services on site. However, there are plenty of surrounding restaurants such as Blanco and True Food Kitchen that are much more reasonable. Although most families, including ours, will never be able to afford paying $500+ a night for a room at the Phoenician, the hotel is definitely worth using your SPG points especially during their off-peak season so you can realize an even greater value. We highly recommend the Phoenician in Scottsdale Arizona and hope you have a chance to check it out!

Traveling VeggiesMy wife and I had late supper last night at CC and it was a fantastic experience!  I always expect great food and wine, which they delivered on again-- Tiger Prawns, Duck Confit, Chile Relleno and of course, the famous Chopped Salad.  But what really blew us away was extraordinary service from waiter Bryan Mummaw.  I am in the business of helping companies of all sizes and types improve their customer experience.  Bryan was among the best waiters ever.  Personable, attentive, interesting to talk to, very knowledgeable about the wine and food, a subtle salesman but not pushy, and there when we needed and wanted him, not overbearing in the least.  The mark of a great waiter/waitress is staying as much of the dining time as possible in visual connection with his/her tables so he/she can sense their needs from a distance.  Bryan is not just good at this, but a true master.  Thanks Bryan for making CC a special experience for us last night, even though we've been there at least 10 times before.Love Streets of New York.  It's one of my favorite pizza places in the Valley.  I had an awesome first date here on 2/1, which led to four more dates with Aubrey.

'And Aubrey was her name.  A not so very ordinary girl or name.'  Like the Bread song, I met Aubrey two weeks before Valentine's Day.  Ironically, our conversation online was mediocre.  Like an idiot, I told her, 'I don't think we'd be a good match.'  Talking more, I suggested a date going to a Haiti fundraiser dinner at Streets of New York.  My attitude was nothing to lose, probably an average date and great pizza.  Our date well exceeded expectations.  We clicked on everything and stayed over two hours.

I'll always associate this location of Streets of New York with this date.Dr. Hoecker is a caring and professional doctor. His nurse also made a lasting first impression. This facility is extremely professional and clean.Regal Rags is a hidden gem! Regal Rags carries so many designer brands from Boutique labels to High End Runway labels. You never know what you will find. There is something here for every women and every budget. Currently there is a 75% off sale going on tell the end of August. Then a few days before Thanksgiving there will be a large parking lot sale where merchandise is 75-90% off. It is absolutely mind blowing, and amazing. Come in and take a look, you won't be disappointed.


We have the best customer service here. You are welcomed upon entering, given refreshments, and treated like royalty. It doesn't matter if you purchase or not, you will leave with a smile on your face. 

So come on down bring 10 items to cosign that are in good selling condition. We only take Women's clothing, no children's or men's clothing!This place gets it right from the moment you walk in the door. Signed baseballs jerseys and bats by legends on the wall, a friendly host to greet you and when you sit down they ask if you want free chopped liver. It comes with bits of egg and onion, warm rye bread and bagel chips. 

Our waiter, Jeff, was friendly and attentive, even lending us his flashlight to read an old newspaper story in the rafters. The cream of mushroom soup made from scratch was superb. Our mains were baby back ribs, the specialty of the house, cooked perfectly with a flavorful sauce. The 'broasted' chicken was to die for: moist and juicy with a crispy outer skin. The fries were piping hot, as they should be. And the portions are beyond generous.

We topped it off with key lime pie, light and tasty, an ideal complement to the meaty mains. And the bill was under $60, an amazing deal. As a bonus, some of the players drop in during spring training.Love this place. Truly one of the best Italian restaurants in the valley.. Great ambiance. Authentic Italian food. Very reasonable priced as well. Great serviceBest sashimi in the valley hands down! The yellow tail, tuna, salmon, rainbow rolls are all amazing!Hands down the BEST pizza in the Valley. We've been going here for many years but I've never written a review. We usually eat at the Old Town Scottsdale location once a week. The pizza and service is always consistently good. We love to get a table right by the kitchen so we can watch the pizzas being prepared. The crust is thin and always cooked to perfection. We always order a large pepperoni (the pepperoni is never greasy), sausage (has the perfect balance of spices), mushrooms (fresh), & onions.
They use fresh mozzarella, not the processed which makes a huge difference. Their sauce is just the perfect balance of flavors. It's sooo good I could drink it by the glass. Wish I could get the recipe. I'm hoping they will start selling it soon.
Service is always outstanding. Our server was Matt, he's new but worked at the Grimaldi's in TX where he moved from. He was hands down the best server we've had. There really aren't any bad servers but he went above and beyond. 
The manager is Mike and he's been there 3 yrs. He does a great job. Always tries to make it to your table to make sure everything was ok. It's amazing that he gets around to most of the tables with all that he has going on. If you watch him you'll see him delivering drinks or food, then back in kitchen overseeing things. Great guy and very personable. Give this one a try, you won't be disappointed. One last thing.....be sure to save room for their NY cheesecake...it's delicious!!!I was shopping a little on my 30th birthday in Old Town and I decided here to stop here (Feb. 4th) for lunch. My husband was at the Double Tree down the street at a trade show so I figured I would try to enjoy my day. I ate by the bar and had a wonderful conversation with the restaurant's manager Rose. She had an outstanding personality and actually got me through this bittersweet day, as all my friends are back in RI and I was sort of having a lonely 30th. I had the roast beef sandwich with the au jous sauce, salad and fries. I also had a glass of riesling (my personal favorite). And as Rose and I were talking about the difficulties of relocation I mentioned it was my birthday- no not to get anything for free. But I was treated to another glass of wine on the house and a slice of cheesecake. She did tell me that she does not work on Saturdays- sorry to other Yelpers who had bad customer service- she did tell me about Karokee but my singing days are over. I would definitely go back for lunch again just because I was treated so well.This is one of the best restaurants in the area. You always get great food. The drinks are good. The service is very good. Make sure you have a reservation unless you do not mind to wait for long time.Just dropped in for drinks and an appetizer of the mac and cheese which has disappeared for now.  The grapefruit drink with basil was completely amazing and refreshing.  Matched it with homemade chips and onion dip.  Not to mention there always seems to be a pretty crowd in the JADE bar.I recently stayed here for a business conference. I really enjoyed this hotel for those little things that matter (to me). Here is a rundown on my list:

The room was very spacious with a double sink, a tub/shower and large closet in the bath area (almost like a walk in). There was a door separating the sink area from the shower/tub area (I like that). The room had a microwave, refrigerator and small coffee/tea maker.

The 'hotel supplied' shampoo and conditioner were fantastic, enough so that I brought the extra's home. Great stuff. I travel very light and take my chances on those items and wasn't sorry I didn't bring my own.

The hot water was REALLY HOT, fantastically so. Assuming it was like most hotels, I started it at the hottest setting and walked away. When I came back and put my foot in... holy cow! I had to add cold water before I got in. This is NOT a complaint...there are not many things more important to me than having a really hot bath, except of course things like world peace and solving world hunger :)

Have you ever noticed that many hotel thermostats seem like they are they for looks and not actually functional? Not so here. If I set it high it immediately warmed up the room. As someone who is always cold, I really appreciate when I can warm up a room quickly.

The bed was extremely comfortable and the bedding was perfect for me. One of my colleagues found the down comforter a tad too warm. They requested a replacement blanket and were very happy after that. I loved everything about that bed.

There are 2 gyms on the premises. The 'free' small one and a nicer one located at the SPA. The Spa gym is $35 per day, but free if you purchase a service at the spa that day. Being in a conference all day and group dinners at night, I finally got the chance to do a quick work out late Friday night. Spa gym closed at 7, but free gym was open 24 hours, so free gym it was. It was perfectly fine for a quick 'out of town' workout. It had one of those band machines with 2 pulleys and different handles, 2 adjustable benches, enough free weights (for me), 2 leg machines, treadmills and eliptical machines. There was a bottled water dispenser machine and towels which was great because I forgot both. 

There was only 1 bad thing I can say which is true in most hotels. The blow dryer was terrible. For some reason hotels do not include the funnel tip. There must be some reason for that, but I don't know what it is. If you need a funnel tip on your dryer I suggest bringing your own.  If I ever visit again I will have to make room for that in my bag.

I deducted a star for the blow dryer, but then I added it back for being able to make the room warm enough so quickly and the ability to take a boiling hot bath!  Great hotel, highly recommend.We stayed here during our first visit to Arizona. It was a great place, very spacious, though a little dated. It was so big and spaced out with all the amenities that the resort have workers constantly driving around in golf carts to shuttle guests back and forth from their rooms. The staff was friendly and extremely helpful. They were always there to lend a hand. They have an efficient shuttle service to/from the airport. 

Staff was also very accommodating when it came to requesting a later check-out time. Check-out is at noon but when we requested a later check-out, we were granted 1:30pm without any extra charges or fees. 

The holiday decoration here was lovely. Put me right in the Christmas spirit.Food is great! The patio is one of the nicest parts to the place. Certain nights they have music outdoors. Chimnea fireplaces lit. Very dark. Great place to take out of town guests, or for date night. Inside it looks like an old Spanish hacienda. Have had steak, shortribs, gazbacho. All great. Good wine list.Wonderful staff. Very helpful. I echo what others said:  rice with dates and raisins, Persian ice cream. Big portions. I had lamb kabob and was very pleased.  A fine experience.

This year is same as last year. Outstanding. Make a reservation!When I first moved to Phoenix I was looking for a nearby bike shop so I took a day off and went to a bunch.  I would go in the shop and check it out and see how staff responded.  My record was 4 shops in a row where no one said anything to me.  I have been to many more bike shops in Phoenix since then and those kinds of shops seem to be the rule.  Rage Cycles is not that kind of bike shop.  They won't give you attitude because they suspect you do not belong to the club.  They are willing to help anyone.  I have been talked out of spending more money because they thought it wasn't worth it.  They really care about bikes and your happiness while you ride.

The only problem is they are far away from where I live.  But I keep going because they are the best.I love china wok!! Ever since moving out here's years ago I've been looking for a good Chinese food place in Arizona and when I found china wok I stopped looking. I have to have it at least 3 times a week. They know my order I go so much.  Everything is fresh and they make it quick.Best meatball sub i've had in a long time.  Meatballs were big and just soft enough.  Plenty of sauce and cheese.  I got a half order and I was so full!  Probably hard to find a seat during the lunch rush and I've heard complaints that they are slow, but  we didn't have any trouble.Wow, outstanding.

Had the eggplant parm sandwich - (half - it was a HUGE half), and it was SO delicious.  The cheese was melted just perfectly.

My boyfriend had the Il Purista - w/o the meat since I'm a vegetarian so we could share - so fresh and so tasty.

We also shared the artichoke salad, and gorgonzola stuffed green olives. .... Amazing.

I can't wait to go back - like, maybe for a second lunch in 30 minutes.Fantastic Italian subs! Just like back in Jersey...So much meat, it's like the opposite of all the other sub chains. 

Why do they have to be so far from home?Not only is George and Son's super tasty, but George himself is one of the funniest nicest guys you will meet! 

My company has hosted the annual Christmas luncheon at Georges two years in a row now, and there is a good reason why, The food is ALWAYS spot on and the service is always above and beyond! 

My boss always orders ahead of time and it seems like coarse after coarse comes out from the kitchen. 

Some of the highlights that stick out in my head, The Shrimp with glazed walnuts, the noodles w/chicken, and the pot stickers. We had about 8 different dishes and I cant pretend to remember them all. 

One note of warning. George likes to mess with people. My boss had duck sent to the table, George set the plate in front of me with the ducks fried head just staring back at me! Eeeep! hahah 

If you are up in this neck of the woods go drop by!I'm not a beer drinker but the food keeps me coming back. If you order any type of sandwich, make sure you ask for it on beer bread or you're seriously missing out! My favourite is to get the roast beef with au jus on beer bread with a side of beer fries - add cheese on top for more extra tasty calories. My dad loves the beer too so if that's your thing, you won't be disappointed. The atmosphere is also awesome - the porch is kept cool with shade and misters all year 'roud and the inside is dark but open with super high ceilings and large windows. You can see back into the brewing area and there's a million TVs with various games and news on if your conversations ever lull. The wait staff is always nice and prompt with service, too. It's just a great and highly recommended place for natives and tourists alike. They even have breakfast!Got in right away. Ordered the sampler beer and was so worth it. Haven't been here much but did find the beer I like which was actually a dark brew. The food was so yummy and quick. The waitress was friendly and attentive.I can't believe I haven't written a review for Four Peaks! I've only been eating here for about seven years. I have my favorite meal and when I have a fav it's hard for me to get anything else so I get the Carne Adovada. Tender with a rich smoky flavor which is really unique to Four Peaks. They serve it with black beans, rice (which I don't eat), sour cream and two big, soft, warm tortillas. It's not spicy but I add some additional kick with some AZ hot sauce. They recommend a Hop Knot which I love but I actually prefer the 8th street with this meal, just a bit lighter. 

Today's visit was very nice, our waiter was very attentive offering samples of the beer, water and checked on us often. Our food came out crazy fast. A woman who I think was the manager came by and checked on us. The bus boys removed our plates quickly. We walked around to look at the building and a gentleman from the back area came to speak with us and gave us a bit of history on the building. 

A great experience. The place is always busy with college aged kids but you can be a *bit* ;) older and still have a nice experience there.Calling all stoners, Calling all stoners. Well ok not just stoners because the food here is awesome for those of us who aren't stoners too.

The menu names will make you feel like you are breaking the law just by ordering a La Canna Blunt or a Kush piner but the only thing illegal about these is how good these "toasted" subs taste. No matter what your mental state when you get one of these you will chow them down like you haven't eaten in day.

My personal favorite is the aforementioned La Canna fileld with your usual selection of italian meats and olives, throw on some of there pickles and you have a tasty snack to munch on. 

Don't forget to order one of their special brownies filled with all kinds of chocolatey fudgey goodness when you get the dessert munchies.Being my first review, there is only one place I've always had a 5-star experience. Hoodlum's is the ultimate music/cd/vinyl/DVD/used music store in the Valley. ZIA and Stinkweeds are a distant second in terms of selection, price and overall experience.

Steve and Kristian are two of the nicest local business owners I've ever met. They know a ton about music and the local scene. They'll help you find anything you need.

Tucked in the SW corner of Guadalupe and McClintock (next to Traders Joe's), this is a special place to find that CD/DVD you've been waiting to purchase. 

They also have a wide selection of used CD's and DVD's to are at bargin prices, be sure to check that out too!I love this place. Great menu and tons to choose from. The staff is just a bunch of hippies but whatever. I recommend the chipotle chicken pizza, it is awesome! The pita is so fresh here as well. You will not be disappointed. The price is actually ok too! Hummus is great, teas and juices are even better. You won't regret this choice.Fantastic crew! I went to the wrong hotel, and the Shuttle guy and front desk were very kind, patient and helpful in figuring out where I was and where I needed to be.Amazing, plain and simple.

I don't quite have the experience that my girlfriend does when it comes to Pho (she grew up back east), but this place has the best Pho that I have tasted.  I took my girlfriend here to try it out because I saw the reviews here on yelp and I am glad that I did.  The food we had was amazing and we will definitely be going back for more.  

If you are in the mood for great Vietnamese food, Khai Hoan is the place to go.Big rig pasta here is the bomb! A def must try if you're feeling like pasta instead of pizza. The pizza here is also amazing but I LOVE the big rig!Fabulous store!!  My husband and I purchase all of our dog supplies from here, and we come back over and over again!  We love the high quality food they sell (no gluten, fillers, etc.), as well as the exceptional service.  They remember us very time we come in, and they are always excited to see our dog, Lucy.  We lived close to this store for a while and never knew they sold dog supplies, but after we've shopped here, believe me - we won't be going anywhere else!!I may have just been the luckiest woman in the world to have the best wedding vendors- ever.  Arizona Inspirations Catering was no exception.

This for me was my first and only stop for food.  My husband and I are foodies and so this was a very important part of our wedding.  

We had 2 tastings, and they were awesome, but were invited to as many as we wanted to attend.  The food we tried was great and the food at the wedding was better.

Nik and his chef made my day.

I'm searching for another reason to have them cater.Turkish coffee!!  Drink so much.  
Thick as dirty motor oil and the fine grounds in the bottom are like chewing on sand. I Love it.
The food is also really good.This place is super hard to find and you'd never think to eat here unless someone refers you. Well I'm referring you. It is awesome! I haven't had anything I didn't like but there gyro is so good. They give generous portions and it is delicious. Also their feta is amazing.I have loved Haji-Baba for 20yrs or so.  Cheapest way to get spices (if u save ur old jars).  Never drive by w/o stopping.  usually get babaganouj, tabooli, & falafel.Went to Eric after I bought a car from a small...now realizing somewhat shady dealership (I will review them after they do or don't fix things).

He spent 30 minutes checking out my car and then another 30-40 minutes explaining what kind of repairs I should expect with a car at 50,000 miles. Now of course I just bought this car 2 weeks ago and...yes I should have came to Eric before I signed the papers because he took the time to show me how he measured my breaks and why I will need new ones in about 5,000 miles. Awesome.

He also gave me a packet of information which (I will take a picture of and post) tells you when you need to get all these things done to your car. I don't know why teachers don't give you this packet in high school...something actually useful to learn. I will treasure this packet. He also has some discounts on his website and if you are an Employee Network (check employeenetwork.com) member you get 10% off your total invoice. He did not charge me anything for the "courtesy inspection" he called it.

Side note, after owning an 2001 Toyota Camry I have much respect for people that take care of old cars. He has a 2003 is a smoker but does not smoke or let any family members eat in his car. I am not a smoker but I bet that is an extremely hard thing to do. Great guy, you can tell his heart is in engines and making his customers happy.

I will be making this my new Auto repair shop.The margherita pizza is as good or better than Four Peaks! WARNING: IF YOU LIKE THIN CRUST, DON'T ORDER 7"  !!!!   
For some reason, they can't make the crust thin on those little pizzas. All other sizes  are very thin and nicely crisp. That is the way I like mine...thin and crisp!!
This review is only for their 11"+ thin crust pizza's.Fantastic food. Fantastic atmosphere.Excellent place to dine on a nice evening...huge outdoor dining area on patios under trees and lights. Bar area is also nice for a small meal or if on the road alone (such as I was). 

Food all looked incredible and it took me too long to decide on what I wanted but I finally settled on the scallops and a cheese board. I can't decide which was better but they were both equally delicious. Great and unique flavors, quality ingredients and well prepared! The cheese selection was varied and they were beautifully paired with honey and mustard. The grilled bread was perfection.The theatre company I work with needed to find a new place, as none of us lived near Chandler....I spoke with Christine who gave me a great quote and was exceedingly friendly.

We started using them for our season and have been happy from the get go.  Our banners look awesome, the programs are spot on, and when we had a problem, (our mistake, not theirs) they worked with us to fix it.  (Coming in on a Saturday to finish our job?  Thank you Charles!!  Staying late on Friday to get us through the show?  Colleen, you rock!)  

So really, great prices, quality product AND amazing customer service?  This is what a business is meant to be.LeSueur Car Company is hands down the best car dealership I have ever been to.  It is family owned and that makes the atmosphere  laid back and welcoming! I just recently bought a 2011 Nissan Sentra from this dealership and it looked exactly like it did on-line. Their prices are fair, the service is great and they don't try to screw you with stupid fees and overpriced cars. Ryan Biggs sold me my car and he has been the best car salesman I have ever worked with. He answered all my questions and didn't try to trick me into anything.
If you are looking for a used car and expect great service, LeSueur is the place to go!Went for happy hour, 2 of us...ordered mussles, calamari, stuffed mushrooms, crab dip, bucket of shrimp, dessert, and two soft drinks for $44. And we couldn't even finish it all. Service was great and everything was delicious! Would def be back!Every single time I go here they are awesome. They ask to help and go out of their way. Its unreal. And the prices on a lot of items are cheaper.I come here often and want to update my last review.  This is a mom and pop establishment.  Margaret is a delightful personality who never stops working but had time for a friendly greeting to one and all.  He husband, Waldmoor, is the chef and a very good one.  He butchers his own meat an does the cooking so you know it's always consistantly good.  He also makes different soups.....hot ones in the winter time and cold ones in the summer.  My favorite soup is the beet soup which is superb.  My wife won't try it because it's pink.  If you can get past the color, you're in for a taste of heaven.  Wife declares all his other soups outstanding.  Her favorite is sauerkraut soup and pickle soup.  She says they have no equal.
A taste of Europe is a good restaurant serving good food served and made by good peopleAwesome! I got a coupon at Fry's for a $14.99 pedicure so I figured I'd give em a shot. Boy am I glad I did. Very clean place. I was dry impressed that they had a medical grade sterilizer on premasis and that the tools were sanitary. They did an amazing job. I also brought my grandmother and they did a phenomenal job on her as well. Very nice and gentile. Would highly recommend to anyone. Prices r a bit higher than most salons but very well worth it especially knowing that your not gonna come home with some creating crud infection or fungus!! 

Keep up the good work!!!Great place, it's like my second home. I stand by this place and I been Tatted all over the world., highly recommend this place.The food was delicious. I had the carne asada burrito with sour. cream, guacamole and cheese. The other people I was there with got the carnitas and there was no complaints there either.I had them come out last month to do an audit of my system since my master bedroom was not as cool as the rest of my house.  They found out that I had bad air flow since there was not a return in my bedroom and gave me a great price on installing one.  Wow, is it much cooler now in my room!  They also turned me onto a new thermostat that I can operate from my cell phone.  I can now turn my system on or off while away or change the temperature while I am away.  This is great because I hate coming home to a hot house when I am too cheap to leave the air on when I go out of town.  I am really impressed with Mast Air with their knowledge and how they keep up to date with the newest technology.  They have been in business for over 30 years and it really shows.I have been going to  Q's for over ten years. When I went to Alaska, I thought the fish would be better than Q's, but it wasn't , same in Seattle, San Fransisco, Bosten. I am still waiting to eat fish as good as Q's makes. I LOVE THIS PLACE.I have dined here every Saturday morning for the past two months. I won't eat breakfast from anywhere else. The portions are so huge I have enough for my breakfast on Sunday as well. The staff is wonderful. I will certainly eat here again. I order an omelette with bacon, ham, and sausage,  home fries, cinnamon raisin toast, and coffee.Wow we are here to review food people.... get a life.  The food here is amazing! i'll never eat another chinese again!Played 36 holes here with a group of friends on a golf trip recently. This is by far the best course we played during the trip. We rented a house in Cave Creek so the drive was about 35 minutes to Quintero....so worth it.
This Rees Jones designed course is a challenge, fair, incredibly well laid out, and an amazing value. We played the Grayhawk Raptor course and I can say without question Quintero puts it to shame for the money. Grayhawk is a great layout but for the money it is not even close. 

If you are into golf and in the area do yourself a favor and make the trip to Quintero.Stopped at this vintage A&W restaurant on the way back from Las Vegas last weekend for a nice cool refreshing treat.  We both had the classic rootbeer float.  It was delicious and brough back such great memories as a child.  Only used the drive-through so cannot comment on anything else.This mcdonalds may not have a playplace for the kids, but the decor inside is so non-mcdonaldsy, i gotta give it extra props. 

Unlike many of the newly remodeled fast food joints, the decor isnt cold & modern, but rather cozy & welcoming. There are brick facades, lattice dividers to keep it cozy, and tons of light & plants. I enjoy eating my occasional burger in here. 

Aside from that, i seem to get very fast & accurate service, especially at the drivethru. 

For what it is, its about as good as it gets.

5 stars.Took my 2.5 year old here after she showed signs of illness. Myself was diagnosed with pneumonia and I wanted to make sure my daughter didn't have it. We were trying to find a new pediatrician that's closer to our home, so I called them and they got her in the same day. We had a follow up a week later and seen two different pediatricians, not sure the names. But both were very nice, took the time to actually talk to me about my concerns. It wasn't like a in and out appointment that I've seen where they are just go go go. I didn't have to wait long at all, and they also let your child pick out a sweet toy before you leave! I highly recommend this office.I have been w/ Southwest since I started flying consistently and they have not disappointed.  There were a few late baggages, but they always compensated with a $50 voucher so I was always happy to get my next flight w/ a nice discount.

They offer sales all the time, and their Rapid Rewards program is pretty awesome.  You can get points not only for flying, signing up for their credit card and using it, for renting cars, booking hotels, dining at participating restuarants, and even filling out customer surveys.  There are so many ways to earn points, and they are so easy to redeem on their website when booking flights.  They also send drink coupons and cool birthday tokens (such as luggage tags) to you in the mail.

Their online system is amazing and easy to use.  Also, as an A-List member, I never have to wait in line to check in my bags, or wait long to go through security.

Their planes are rather small and bouncy, but for the most part I feel safe on their flights.  Thank you Southwest Pilots, and flight attendants for always making me feel welcome, safe, and comfortable.

Oh and don't forget their honey roasted peanuts!  They don't always have them, but when they do, it's delightful!

Yelp Challenge! Started 8/20/2011 (43/365). I have a lot of catching up to doScrew it, 5 stars!

Wound up here on St. Paddy's day.  Glanced up from my walk and noticed the $1.50 Hamm's banner above the door.  Oh hell yeah!  Imma git me some Hamm's for sure!

GF and I bellied up to the bar and were quickly offered some jello shots from the guy sitting next to us.  He brought his own cooler in.  Sweet!  The only thing better than jello shots is free jello shots.

The guy sitting on the other side of us wasn't doing so well.  Judging by the look in his eye and the amount of food on his face I'd say he'd been there for the better part of the day.  Within about 10 minutes he obviously got a little case of the "sleepies."  He shuffled over to the pool table and crawled underneath for a cat nap.  His legs didn't quite make it all the way under the table so the bar manager gave him a little encouragement with some loud words and a swift kick to the ankles.  Classic!

St. Paddy's day wouldn't be complete without some bland boiled food and this year was no exception.  The stateside was serving up free corned beef and cabbage.  Even though we just woofed down some pizza up the street I couldn't pass up a small plate.

We enjoyed some free shuffleboard, a few more Hamm's and called it a day.

I've been in here several times and not once did I leave without feeling truly certain that I had made the right decision when choosing a watering hole.

Thanks Stateside!!Clearly the best bar downtown and a must-visit if you haven't haven't been. It's an echo of the past with one foot in the future. 

Drinks: The drink selection is phenomenal without being pretentious. 
Seating: Lounge-y and bar seating. You can stay here for hours.
People: The bar staff and ownership are great. The crowd is always a mix of cool people.This place has been around since Fremont was "dangerous", I've always enjoyed the pizza but bummed on the early hours. (They were closed before midnight on a weekend!) 

Now, with Fremont exploding, Zappos moving in, and the people from the suburbs who no longer think downtown is "ghetto", Uncle Joe's decided to shut down for a brief moment and do some remodeling! It's better than ever ; new counter tops, ovens, a window to serve side walk customers..still the same great pizza!! An the most important, they are now open late, till 3am! 

If you want fast good pizza while bar hoping, go to Uncle Joe's (local, Independent an a downtown Las Vegas main stay.)

  Also, avoid the corporate chain place across the street at all costs!!!!went to their lunch buffet because it was in the top then of a magazine, at first wasn't very impressed with their variaty, there wasn't a lot to choose from but decided for the meatloaf, which was realllllly nice and juicy and for desset went for the bread pudding that was said their number one, and can't dissagree, it was the best, really looking forward  going back.Neon JunkYard is a "must tour".  As a local, I waited a long time before taking the trek!  The tour guides aim to please, and treat everyone special!  If you don't know exactly where you are going, you will get lost.
Don't miss this!  especially if you are an art lover!Tried many different gyros from different places in town and this will always be my # 1 ,  just the best! :)This is my four day review of McMullan's Irish Pub. Just to qualify, I flew from Orlando Florida to Las Vegas just to spend four days in this specific Irish Pub. I may be a bit biased.

The pub has three distinct sections. At one end is a bar with video poker machines. These are the multi-denominational multi game machines so you have choices. The bar also has a lot of promotions such as a free spin for prizes for every four of a kind you hit. Smoking is permitted in this room - picture old vegas and you get the picture. The middle section is more like a traditional Irish Pub - no gaming and lots of private seating for meals. Of course the Guinness is a proper poor - no sense reviewing an Irish pub that can't do that. The back is another bar that is mostly for private events and the like. It's got a full bar and plenty of room for a decent get together.

The Shepherd's Pie is wonderful as is the Farmhouse Irish Breakfast. (Before you ask - white and black pudding is sausage) The service is great and personable 24 hours a day.

We got in at 1:30am Christmas Morning and headed to McMullan's right after checking into the hotel. A night cap of a couple of Guinness while we watched the marathon of A Christmas Story on TV. After catching a few winks we were back again for Christmas breakfast of a few more Guinness and Corned Beef Hash and Eggs - wonderful.

We repeated this similar pattern until the 27th when we came back for a private party. The service for our party was fantastic! My wife made all of the arrangements and said that Brian McMullan was wonderful to work with.

All in All I'm pretty stingy with my five star reviews. This place is definately worth every star.Their food sounds fairly familiar on the menu, but when you taste them, they have a exotic strangeness that I like. For example, I never knew what "Marie Rose Sauce" tasted like until I went there to have some chips, but their Irish Curry tasted like a spicier version of my mom's Asian Curry. It even has the same greenish color too.

Any time after 5pm, at any day, is happy hour here. And that means appetizers are half price and so are some of the selected beers. And these are not small appetizers, a plate of Irish chips is about the size of a meal at a fraction of the price ($4) that I would pay for a Big Mac at McDonalds. Nachos and fries are ridiculously huge on the plate.

You'll find a lot of exotic beers here, with names that you never heard of anywhere else. The folks serving you drinks are bona fide Irish, they talk with a accent thats kind of hard to understand without concentrating. And the drinks have a tendency to creep up on me, it builds up to a drunk feeling that is a lot stronger than what I am used to. 

You can find a legitimate Irish Breakfast here too, with black pudding (blood sausage), eggs, etc. And it barely puts a dent in the bank account, just ten bucks!Hey after I got kicked out of Club Car Lounge for being accused of being cheap I searched for my neighborhood bar and found Jackson's. Even I was treading on enemy territory (since I'm a Viking fan). They treated me with respect and they had $2.75 miller lite verses $6 miller lite at club car lounge. The bartender Eddie was such a great guy was very very friendly. Wether your a Packer fan or not, this place is great! I will return with respect! But Vikings still rule! LolBest pizza in town... hands downVery friendly and knowledgeable staff! Made us feel welcome and comfortable...told us about the store and diff tiles then let us wander alone to browse. Didn't feel any pressure to buy and no salesman like attitude. They're selection was huge...almost too much to choose from. They let us take samples around the store to compare as well as take home. Placed and order with them and definietly wil be back for our next project!What a great experience and amazing food!  My husband and I came here and had the pizza, lasagna, and Carbonara.  All three were just splendid!  We couldn't stop eating.  Our server, Eric, had great suggestions and we had the pistachio dessert he recommended which again was completely amazing.  We will definitely be back.   My only complaint is when we arrived, we went to the bar to have a glass of wine and the people working the bar ignored us for about 15 minutes.  We tried to get their attention too, but to no avail.  We just decided to be seated and the experience was great from then on.CHOCOLATE CAKE CHOCOLATE CAKE CHOCOLATE CAKE CHOCOLATE CAKE CHOCOLATE CAKE CHOCOLATE CAKE!!!!!!

Order the chocolate cake - you have to order it with your entree so it's ready for dessert.  Mere words cannot describe it's deliciousness.Can't believe I have lived up the street from this place for 6 months and had not tried it yet. Went for my birthday a few weeks ago and have already been back twice since. Great food quality for the price and excellent flavor. The linguini with red clam sauce was awesome and at $13 it's a steal! Tonight we ordered an 18" pie with 3 toppings and it came to $17 total. Well worth it... better than a majority of the pizza places in town and cheaper with better quality ingredients. You know a place is good when its busy every night for dinner, even tonight on a Monday the place was packed and the kitchen was slammed. 
Looking forward to my next visit, probably next week :) haha
This is a must visit Italian spot with an old school feel and great prices!My bf and I have dined here twice in 2 weeks. Love the atmosphere, service, value and delicious Italian! The first time we went was on a Tuesday night and waited an hour for a table for two. Very busy and happy for them! ;) they take reservations an hour after the time you call so just call ahead!WOW! How did I not discover this little place before? I'm so glad my friends introduced me to Nora's. Service was great.The food was fantastic, the garlic bread is the real deal. I had the Chicken Parmesan. What a little gem tucked away in a strip mall. Definitely coming backBest corned beef hash ever.  Diner is awesome.One of my favorite hotels in Vegas. The standard suites are very nice and spacious. It had a sofa and a table with two chairs. It also had an iron, ironing board, hair-dryer, safe, refrigerator, two sinks, and large bathroom. Check in was a breeze, as well as check out. Ordered some room service, very prompt and friendly. I would definitely come back!Alright, this place has been working it's way into my heart all summer. Finally, I have to admit this is my favorite Mexican spot in all of Las Vegas. 

I drool over the steak thats marinated in salsa, the beans and salsa they bring to every table, the margaritas oh boy I'm getting brain freeze just thinking about it...I never had bad service or even a bad thing off the menu. This place is amazeballs.

I am so happy I have found you, Viva! :) BESOSTook group of 15 to dinner on Saturday August 6, 2011. Group of employees and husbands as well as our 4 teenage children. Awesome panoramic view of Vegas. Restaurant staff very professional but welcoming and friendly. NEVER made us feel stupid, which would've been easy since most of group not used to fine formal dining. Explained anything we asked about. Food was best I've ever tasted. Had cheese plate instead of a salad before entree. Loved it! I ordered the duck breast and since I had already had the cheese and much wonderful bread, I got full before I had eaten half. I shared the duck with several friends and all enjoyed it. So tender! We had a table of shared desserts. All were good but the creme brûlée was the BEST EVER!Dr. Baig is very flexible as far as psychiatrists go. She is compassionate and cares about her patients far more than many other psychiatrists I've seen. While her religious affiliation is obvious to even a casual observer, she does not allow her religion to interfere with giving the best, most professional care to all of her patients. 

Her waiting room is almost always full and waits can be very long, but this is the sign of a good psychiatrist. A psychiatrist with an empty waiting room is bad news because that means nobody wants to see them! 

I am extremely satisfied with the care I receive from Dr. Baig. In fact, I drive nearly 200 miles St. George, Utah to her office in Las Vegas just to go see her.The end of February was my first time visiting Vegas with my sisters and we figured we might as well check all the sights off our bucket lists. One of my oldest sisters has been very sick and we knew that this would sadly be the last trip we could all take together. We took a lot of pictures in the attraction and also participated in the two professional photo opportunities. I didn't plan on purchasing any of those photos but a young lady whose name was either Jennifer or Jessica convinced me otherwise. I'm so happy I did because my sister passed a couple of days ago and now I have those pictures to last me a life time. You can put a wax attraction any where, but this location in particular had some of the kindest employees I've encountered. Five stars for me.Took 2 of my friends to Fat Tuesday's for the first time this weekend and ordered for them my usual (the peach Bellini w/the extra shots). They loved it! No lie, best drink in Vegas!I always begin my vacation in Vegas with Fat Tuesday...and then I begin each morning with one too :) The atmosphere at Fat Tuesday is fun...always playing great music...and the bartenders are a blast...great way to begin and end your vacation...sheessh....I want one now!Second time visiting Spago. First was in Beverly Hills. They've done it again. Sent me off a happy camper. I had the Red Wine Braised Beef Short Ribs. Good God. That paired with the Ricotta Gnocchi was puuuuure freakin heavenly deliciousness. Also had the white peach Bellini and the eggnog Creme brûlée. To die for. Just to die for.While on vacation in Las Vegas I was looking for some gifts for my sisters and remembering that they love M.A.C makeup. The store was busy and i had no clue what to get or what i was looking at...I was approached by a girl named Jackie who asked me "how could I help you out today". I told her that I was shopping for my sisters and if she would pick out some things that they would like.She showed all of there holiday stuff. She put together some holiday gift bags for me, making this the easiest and fastest shopping experience. Thanks making me best brother this Christmas.This review is only for the margaritas that we enjoyed both times we were in vegas.
The first time a few years back was before the extensive inside renovation which highly confused us this time.
We had remembered walking straight back to a huge bar with 99 cent oversized margaritas.
Yes that right, sompaired to other that charge upto $30!
Now we wandered through the endless maze of Circus Circus not knowing where we were going, everything was newer, bigger, better!
Finally we found a new margarita bar (by the left side of the entrance) and got the super kitchy yard long margaritas on a sling and mixed tropical mango and strawberry lemonade margaita for a yard long drink for two while we explored the strip.
Only in Vegas baby, only in Vegas........................I was looking for a huge wallet to fit all my receipts and ended up here at LV. This place is nice but not too much selection showed. The sales people are friendly too. After looking at the wallet I had to purchase a purse that would go with it...lol...im such a sucker for bags...lols..Anyways to end this short I purchased a Monogram Vernis Amarante Zippy Organizer and a Rosewood Amarante handbag. With all the excitement, i didnt even look at the receipt when i left.
When I got home from the trip i decided to look at the receipt. They had charged me 2 handbags instead of just one. So I immediately went to the LV at the Beverly Center and informed them of the situation. The salesperson was very nice and was able to help me. He ended up calling the LV @ the Wynn hotel and everything was settled. They immediately credited my credit card for the mistake.Ask for Jackie as your waitress and enjoy the best dining experience in Vegas. The food is fabulous. But Jackie made it a night to remember. If you're ever in San Francisco, Jackie.... just sayin  :-)Speechless. Unlike other Vegas hotels who tend to imitate european architecture, they have the most unique and exceptional designs. Check out the waterfall fountain and beautiful garden.I like this place.  People say the new expansion should be called "Ego" instead of "Encore" but you have to respect the man for doing it right and setting the standard.  I love the design, the shows, the restaurants, and most of all, the cocktail waitresses.  The King Baller of Vegas.I've never actually stayed in this hotel, but I always make sure I visit when I'm in Las Vegas.  
My favorite part of this hotel is the outside seating area by the water. They put on some water show.  I was truly impressed.  
Normally I only go to Vegas for work, but when I do again on my own I'd want to stay here for sure.
The hotel itself is beautiful.Fact...the Wynn is as good as all of the hype claims it to be. The casino decor includes fantastic mosaic tiles--modern and bold, but not overdone at all. Also around the casino were the restaurants other reviews told of...great looking, smelling, and tasting food! 
With the Wynn being so high-end, I thought I might feel out of my league there. But the customer service was personal and welcoming, professional but far from stuffy or aloof.. The accommodations were more than fantastic: my room had a panoramic view that overlooked the golf course and pool. The bathroom was done tastefully and had an awesome dual vanity/soaking tub/standalone shower. My bed was dreamily comfy, and the turn-down service left slippers for my footies! 
Seriously, I will make it a point to stay at the Wynn from now on. Elegant but not stuffy decor, great staff (I love you Frankie!), tasty restaurants, and super comfy accommodations. I have finally found "my place" in Vegas.BEST hotel in Vegas.  Impeccable restaurants, service, atmosphere, rooms, best best best all around.. :)Went for a summer vacation and I think we found our Vegas hotel.  We paid extra for a suite with a view of the strip.  All I kept saying was so this is how the rich live.  My wife said the margarita was the best she's had (couldn't hurt that it was delivered poolside).  Staff seemed to be friendly.  We got escorted by the chef to each station within the buffet so my wife could  be informed of what contained peanuts or nuts.  It is located near the mall.  Being at the end of the strip meant none of the drunken drama that is up and down the strip.Located in the Fruit Loop which is kind of like Las Vegas' Gay Bermuda Triangle....is a grungy bar called The Buffalo. It's in a charming strip mall next to a Gay items store called Get Booked with an older weird prissy owner who recommended the bar to us. He told us, "Tell the bartender that blah blah blah sent you". I told the bartender that blah blah blah sent me and I got a free drink!

The ruggedly handsome bartender was really cool and laid back. He had a well trimmed beard and a baseball cap so you knew he was not necessarily the twinkoid WeHo type. It kind of gives a clue as to what crowd frequents this place. According to him the crowd is diverse even though The Buffalo has a bear/leather/daddy reputation. In the end all that mattered to my BF and I was that the people in the bar were cool. We were chatting with a bearded old guy from San Francisco who had a ton of good stories. There was a much younger guy who was literally passing out at the bar too. Another older guy came in later on.

I was concentrating on the cheap and strong drinks and my BF was concentrating on the slot machine in front of him and right on the bar. We were killing time basically, waiting for our room at the hotel to be available. It was pretty empty since it was the early afternoon.

It was an especially cool day for me because dvd player was broken haha! Why, you may ask was that soooo cool? Well, it was really, really ridiculously cool and memorable because the bartender was compelled to use the vhs player and the tape that was in the machine had some really cool 80's new wave videos on it. 

There are a couple of pool tables here.

Parking is no issue during the day but in the night it's another story. We came back and the lot was full.

It's true! If you want to be surrounded by unpretentious people this place is really worth your time.I loovvveee this store! This is one of the best locations I have been to. Their selection is unbeatable.Great Vet... Holistic, knowledgable and delivered results which I have not been able to get for the past 2 years.  

Highly recommend her for holistically oriented people!Fun experience, personalized m&m's for our little ones!We felt like royalty at Marrakech!  I took my fiancee here for our first anniversary as part of a full day of activities in Las Vegas.  After driving from Los Angeles, seeing a show, and wandering around, this was the kicker at the end of the night...and it didn't disappoint.

Marrakech is a very unassuming restaurant from the outside.  It looks like a regular hole in the wall joint, with nothing spectacular going on inside.  This is where this facade ends.  Once we stepped in, we felt as if we'd been transported to a distant land, where the royalty had lavish tents filled with food, drink, and debauchery.  The interior had a beautiful, and romantic appeal which seduced us with beauty, aroma, and ambiance.  We were lead to our section of the "tent" and began our meal.  It was explained to us that the menu is prix fixe, and if we had any preferences (vegetarian) to let them know.  We did not, so they began to serve us.

Before the meal started, they washed our hands in rose water over a beautifully elaborate bowl, and we knew that we were in for a treat.  Next, they began to bring out the food.  Each dish was extravagant, and each dish progressively tasted better and better.  We were wowed by the presentation of the dishes, and the flavors exceeded even the visual appeal of the beautifully prepared dishes.

Just when we thought we were done, they brought out the dancers.  Now this was a year into our relationship, so I began to avert my eyes from the dancers, and enjoy the company with whom I was spending my time.  My fiancee, however, thought it would be a good idea to make me dance with the dancer.  I obliged, and after an embarrassing (but fun) dance, I was affirmed of the excellence of this place.

We have tried looking around for somewhere similar in our area, but have yet to try something, since this was one of the best dining experiences we had.  We have never found Moroccan food to even come close.Best meal I had on my trip!  The Prime Rib was excellent and the horseradish was very fresh.

Service was excellent.I came to Vegas for a weekend trip, and I HAD to come back here because I've had some intense cravings for the salsa ever since I was here the last time in February. It was like nothing had changed - still had the delicious mesquite salsa, still had the incredible service, and still had the large portions of flavorful food. Now my craving has been satisfied and I got my friend hooked on this place as well; this place will always be on our itinerary when we come back to Vegas.What a nice surprise! We've been staying at New York New York for years and had never eaten at Gonzalez Y Gonzalez. I honestly don't know why because it was wonderful.  My husband and I split an order of fajitas as they are quite generous. Everyone in our party had a great meal, we will go back next visit to NYNY.  They have $5 margaritas and daiquiris during happy hour. Our waiter, Raymond, was a gem! Probably the best person we dealt with at NYNY.I can't believe this place is actually in Circus Circus.  Circus Circus is a low-rent joint catering to parents who bring their tykes to Las Vegas.  The place is crawling with kids.

But The Steakhouse is a respite from all of that.  First, it's old school elegance.  You walk in past the display cases where all the meats are hanging.  It all looked so good.  And the menu was excellent.  The bread basket had a nice variety of breads.  I had king crab legs on ice for an appetizer.  They were by far the best crab legs that I've ever had.  For entree, it was the filet mignon.  One of the best steaks that I've ever eaten.  My father had lobster tail.  Again very good.

Now because it is Circus Circus, you might think this place is cheap.  It is not.  But it is worth every penny.A wonderful dining experience. The service was impeccable and the food was wonderful.  We started with the crab cake with cajun sauce which was delicious. We each had a salad. The caesar was good and the croutons were obviously made right there because they melted in your mouth. I had the 22 porterhouse steak, medium rare, which came out exactly as ordered. Delicious clear to the bone. My wife had two 4 oz filet mignon medallions. One was served "oscar" style with bernaise, crab and asparagus. The other was served with a jumbo shrimp and a large scallop.  For sides we chose the asparagus, sauteed mushrooms and the potatoes au gratin. The whole meal was a great dining experience. For dessert we had coffee and the lemon cake. We will definitely be going back on our next trip to Vegas.What took me so long to go here .... best steak house ever!!!

Went here for my wife's birthday dinner w/some friends and we split sooooo many yummy items!

- 32 oz waygu ribeye wow mmmmmmmmm served medium rare and pre-cut sooo goood

- Accompanied with a 14 oz lobster tail ... mmmmmmmmm

- Sides included the Mac n' Cheese and Mushrooms, fantastic

- Appetizers were the delicious crab cakes and shrimp cocktail

- Dessert, since it was the wife's birthday we got a delicious lemon cake (that giant thing) and we also ordered the banana bread pudding

The Service was top notch!

Go with a group so you can share.  This place is insanely good!Reading all the reviews, I expected to get mediocre service.. but I was pleasantly surprised. Our server was very attentive and very cool.
We ordered...
-the LINGUINI with CLAMS and PANCETTA was very tasty... the linguini was perfectly al dente which is hard to find with fresh pasta.
-my husband ordered the HONG KONG STYLE HALIBUT.. which I thought was ok, but he loved it... it was a little too tart for me. He said you have to have each component of the meal to balance out. I personally would never order it.. but he would totally order over and over again.
-they have a kids menu.... and my daughter got the cheesy pasta... it was simple and my daughter cleaned her plate. Too bad that you have to order each thing separately... we had to order her milk separately... which was like an extra $2.50 or $2.75.
-SANGRIA.. was really tasty. the apples were really crisp. The pitcher was only $25.. how can you beat that?

oh.. and the bread.. VERY GOOD... crusty on the outside and soft on the inside... and the olive tapenade that they serve with is.... mu-ah! I could just eat that ALL day long!

Overall... will definitely be back!Ask for Pierre, best waiter I've ever had.

Pistachio Souffle, unbelievable. 

Duck & Black Cod, outstanding.

Best view of Vegas while you dine.We enjoy eating at Outback at least once a week. We always ask for the most friendly and efficient server. Joe Broderick make our evening fun and enjoyable!! The food is excellent and always prepared the way we like it. Can't say enough good things about going to the Outback!!! :-) :-) :-) :-)My fiance and I wanted to by a new couch. We were convinced that rc willey was the only way to go. We found a leather sectional couch that we would "settle" with at Rc Willey. When we went to buy that couch we found that it was sold out. Thank god! We had already went to Ashley furniture and Macy's furniture and all the other ones out here. Except for Bassett. We looked them up online. Saw that they had a great sale going to on the day we were planning on buying. Went into the store and fell in love with the Dillon couch. The couches at Bassett are of much higher quality then all the other furniture stores. They are a little pricer then others but look for a sale and plan and wait if need be. Just like a luxury car; if you want nice, you have to pay for nice. As for the sales people, they are not like used car men. They know that their product is good and they stand behind it. Thomas Bednarczyk helped us and he was great. We weren't rushed or pressured. Even when we couldn't decide between two couches because they were both so comfortable! We felt like every other store ( other than Macy's which is already known for high quality products ) has very mediocre products.LOVE LOVE LOVE this place!!!

After a horrible experience at another vet, we tried Blue Cross and fell in love! My poor little dachshund (Diablo) had IVDD, an open abscess, high liver counts and was horribly mistreated for 3 days by a so called vet, who only cares about money and not about the well being of animals. They tried to push expensive surgery on us without trying any other alternative first. They refused to treat his infection unless we did surgery on his back-telling us it was unethical to treat him without surgery.

We walked into Blue Cross and immediately felt welcome! The front desk staff was so friendly and helpful. We were helped right away and the vet techs and staff were again so friendly and treated my baby with love. Dr. Wiggers is amazing! She listened to our whole story, and talked it over with us. I felt that she cared so much about helping my dog. She went over different courses of action for him, letting us know what her recommendation was but not pushing anything on us. We decided on a path of care and Diablo starting improving within a day! By the end of the week he was his old self!

I can't say enough wonderful things about Dr. Wiggers and every person at their office. I am so thankful that they were there to fix the horrible experience we had elsewhere. They definitely do so much more than the basics, but I'm thankful that is the ground they built themselves on. They know pets are family, they treat them as their own, they show them love and they really want them to be healthy and happy. 

I would give them way more stars than 5 if I could! Thank you Blue Cross-You Rock!!Got our invitations and they came out perfect!! They are even addressing the envelopes for us so it is literally hassle free. They are great and we will definitely be coming here for our other paper goods needed for the wedding.Let me just start this yelp review by saying this was my first dental visit in a few years. I am not really fond of going to the dentist, but I knew It was time to go in for my check up. So I made an appointment at Image Dental for my oral check up and X-Ray. When I arrived there I was greeted by Dayna and Amber. Amber was great she made me feel comfortable and cracked jokes all the while informing me of what I need to fill out and the information that I needed. After the paperwork was done, Lorita took the X-Ray and introduce me to Dr.Hoang.
          After a short period of looking at the x-Ray Dr. Hoang told me that I needed to go to an oral surgeon to extract a tooth, after that news.. I wasn't a happy camper, but it is what it is. Dr. Hoang was honest and I appreciate that.
        I would also like to mention that I do not have any dental insurance and thought that it would be expensive, but they worked with me about the financials and kept it affordable for me. Lori, the hygienist, did my deep cleaning. She also told me that if i felt any sudden pain just move my hand and let her know. I didn't feel much pain and she did a great job.  Overall it was a really Great experience,I was in and out in an hour.The employee's are nice and helpful. This one time a woman went on a scavenger hunt for matte's. I was like, 'whoa, calm down.' Very helpful. The only complaint I do have about the employees is that if the one and only employee working there is helping someone with a custom frame job and you are just waiting to check out the picture frame you are buying, it is going to be a wait. And I understand, that person was there before me and I should wait my turn, but they are doing a 30 minute job and I just want to buy a frame. I wish there were always two cashiers working but then again I understand that they are not the type of store that is always busy.
Anyway, their selection on frames is wonderful and the frames are so beautiful I could just buy them all. They sell mirrors and other home decor. And you can't leave without scanning their clearance section; there are always goodies there!Great locals pub with bar-top gaming.  The servers and bartenders are the friendliest people in town.  Quick service, GREAT FOOD, and a decent selection of tap beers and spirits.

Seriously, I don't understand why there are so many negative reviews!  I guess the one thing I can say is that their Internet jukebox is a bit wonky...Five star service from the time I sat down til I left. We had an INCREDIBLE dinner tonight. We ordered from their Plant Based Menu( Vegan menu). plenty of great options to choose from will be back soon!!I needed a snack for the long flight to the Baltimore Washington metro area.  Have to say they have the best nuts I've ever eaten (almonds, cashews and walnuts).  Crispy, fresh and perfectly seasoned. The woman working the counter was nice and courteous.Excellent place if you're looking for a cheap and quick shoe repair!

I recently bought a pair of Jeffrey Campbell Litas on eBay that were supposed to be in "great condition", but when I got them in the mail last week, I noticed that the rubber tip on the bottom of the heel on one of the shoes was missing (just my luck)! The wooden heel was already worn down as if the previous owner had actually worn the shoes out with the rubber piece missing (the HORROR). So I decided to Yelp a decent shoe repair shop and B & L came up.

I stopped by around 3:30 in the afternoon on a Tuesday, and there was no line as I expected. I was greeted and helped as soon as I walked in! I told the repairer that I wanted to replace the heel tip on the other shoe in addition to adding a heel tip to the shoe that was missing a tip, just so the height and the color of both heel tips would match. He told me that it would take up to 20 minutes if I wanted to wait, but he said I can come back before they closed at 6pm, which is what I did. I was given a ticket stub for my shoes and I left.

I came back around 5:30pm, and there was one other lady in front of me being helped (she was quoted $40 to replace the leather soles on a pair of shoes, which is decent). After 5 minutes of waiting, I was able to inspect my shoes before paying, and the heels on both shoes looked perfect, and I only paid $12 total for the repairs! And FYI, I am VERY picky about my shoes and the condition they're in. I uploaded a photo of the before and after of the damaged heel if you want to take a look.

Overall, the repairer was helpful, friendly and he didn't push me to purchase other items I didn't need, the place was pretty easy to find (corner of Eastern and Tropicana near the 99cent store), the prices are very affordable, and the quality of the work was well worth the money!

This is definitely going to be my shoe repair place from now on!I live in LA and I'm too familiar with the hookah scene and can distinguish good vs bad pretty well. Paymon's has great hookah especially when its happy hour time! If you don't smoke hookah, the happy hour is ridiculously amazing and the food is SOOO yummy. I love the Pesto Pizza and Athens fries! Good quality for a Good price. The drink menu is pretty great too! HOWEVER, this one time I went to Paymons (April 2012) I was with 6 other people and all but 1 of us were over 21. We wanted to smoke but the 1 guy who was under 21 was not allowed in the lounge area where you can smoke. We asked to speak to the manager and no exception was allowed since the bar is in the lounge area. Pretty lame since he was NOT going to drink or smoke, just came to eat in the lounge and watch us smoke. In anycase, just be aware its 21 & OVER for happy hour inside the lounge/smoking inside the lounge/drinking inside the lounge. Oh and happy hr is ONLY given inside the lounge : )Today after I ate these I had a sugar seizure. Doughnuts have got to be the single worst breakfast food ever conceived! But empty calories are delicious. Hate yourself, not the doughnut.

I don't really understand all of the complexities of doughnuts so I choose Al's because going Krispy Kreme seems so corporate and unfashionable. Whenever I have a chance to stick it to the man, I'll do it.

The place was friendly and not hard to find. I got co-worker doughnuts and everyone said they were better than Krispy Kreme which I assume is true because I have not been to Krispy Kreme since like 2008. Not big on doughnuts, people but also not hot for "big doughnut".

A lot of other people seem to be focusing on the negatives of getting doughnuts at Al's so let me share my personal negative thoughts on the place:

The box they came in was super annoying. Brown instead of pink, can you imagine!?

The price was so low I couldn't even guilt trip people about how I spent tons of cash getting doughnuts for them. Way to take the fun out of giving!

The didn't have any diet doughnuts OR any baby panda doughnuts, caviar doughnuts or any other rich person type flavors that would show off my classy status. Aaaaaaaaand, I'm being sarcastic....

I guess I don't have high standards for doughnuts. However, I think a small business deserves a shot over a corporate chain. Down with big doughnut!Went in on my lunch break to get the tire on my jogging stroller fixed and I was out in less than 20 minutes!

I think my techs name was Gilbert and he was super cool and friendly. 

I'll be back for future repairs3 1/2 stars? As Christina Cuenca would say "Really?"

Come on Las Vegas, fresh house made pasta, perfectly crafted thin crust pizza and an amazing wine list.

Really?

A party of five who is beyond lazy but knows collectively that "we" want Italian for dinner. I personally don't have the energy to skip down the Strip to the Venetian and figured eating within walking distance of my hotel would suffice. 

I did a quick check on my trusty iphone Yelp app and found Lupo. The reviews were lackluster at best, but after a hard days work of golf, nap, drinks at the Foundation Room and an amazing caviar appetizer I (we) were in need of something quick and easy. 

From the elevator I was able to secure a 7:30 reservation (and awarded 1000 points by the way) and me and four hungry guys headed over to Lupo. We were greeted by two awesome hostesses who immediately seated us towards the back nearest the open kitchen. Within a few minutes our waiter came right over and took cocktail orders and presented us with the wine list. I did a quick scan and found a moderately priced zin from Tobin James in Paso Robles and before we knew it our drinks and bottle of wine were brought right over.

It was now time to order and let me tell you right here. You cannot get five guys together in an Italian restaurant and not have pizza. We got one to split with meatballs and OH! yes, it was good. Slightly burnt crust  and simple but flavorful toppings, I thought there was no way our entrees could top this.

I was wrong.

My 
Scialatielli "Ai Quattro Passi" con Salsicce alla Bolognese, Basilico e Lamelle di Parmigian (yes copied and pasted from the online menu) was amazing! And the portion size was gigantic. It was so huge that after I was finished the waiter looked at me and asked if the dish was "not to my liking", because he thought I had not touched it. Trust me, I loved every bite, but the Flintstone plate of pasta was more than any man could handle.

This place is in no way a 3 1/2 star restaurant. Everything from the service to the food is a hit. And as I lay here in bed, I am half contemplating getting dressed and head back down there for seconds.

Mama Mia!The perfect resteraunt!  From the service to the food, this place is top notch!  The best Italian resteraunt I have been to in Vegas hands down!I've been living in Las Vegas for 14 years now and I had never stepped foot into a Blueberry Hill.

Came in for lunch and was immediately seated, it was not very packed, I assume it's because of the weather. I usually drive by and the parking lot is full.

The only thing that disappointed me are the specials. They have different ones for different days of the week and they only serve them on the days assigned. I will definitely be coming back on a Tuesday for their pot roast special. 

I decided to go with the popeye chicken. It was really yummy. It came with green beans, mashed potatoes with gravy and a side of chicken noodle soup. The chicken itself in the entree was really juicy, smothered in cheese and spinach.  The chicken noodle soup was very hearty. I was very satisfied with my meal.

To finish the meal off, I ordered a stack of the Oreo pancakes. All I can say is WOW. I had never seen such big, beautiful, fluffy pancakes. I took a bite and my taste buds exploded. Service was great. Our waitress was friendly and our food came out pretty quick. The restaurant itself has a nice, old school vibe. I need to come here often and try everything!I LOVE Lee's Liquor.  We've been coming to this location for years and have hit up other locations in Las Vegas depending on where we happen to be.  At home, we normally shop at BevMo and I have to say that I wish we had Lee's in San Diego!  There is such an amazing selection of beer, wine and the hard stuff and the prices!  Oh my gosh!  They are amazing.  Very affordable and they run specials and have tastings as well.

This location has friendly staff and there is always more items that I want than I need or can afford! They also seem to have more parking on this visit... guess it's been a while since I've been back to this one.   I'll continue to shop here whenever I'm in town and you should, too!  

Just note that if you aren't near this location, check out their other locations throughout the Vegas area.My family has been bringing pets here for 20 years. Dr. Hauck is a FANTASTIC veterinarian! He is patient and gentle with the animals, and very kind to the owners. 
They do a variety of things: boarding, spay/neutering, tail docking, ear cropping (Our Doberman), inoculations, etc. 
I wouldn't take my pets anywhere else beside Dr. Hauck!!!

*He treats birds too!
**The staff is very helpful and kind too!This place never disappoints for amazing Mexican dishes. Attentive wait staff, great atmosphere, delicious margaritas and tasty food. Don't miss this place!!Best service I' ever had. The manager was our waiter that night. He checked that we had enough sauces, drinks (refilling when drinks were not even half empty!), even napkins! We ordered a burger plus a side each. My husband wanted two different sides and they gave us the second as a courtesy of the house. I recommend this place to everyone who is after a good and unexpensive meal. (burgers at 7.99 and are huge). Open 24/7. Also serve breakfast.I LOVE this place. After having  an uncomfortable experience at another vet I turned to Yelp and decided this was somewhere I wanted to check out, so when we got a new puppy we decided to start him of fresh here and I'm so happy I did. I have been nothing but pleased with my experience here. The doctor, Dr. Hagewood, is amazing and you can tell she truly loves her job. It is the one vet I have been to who  comes in, spends plenty of time with you, answers any questions, tell you her honest opinion, tells you exactly what she is going to do to  the animal as she does or what she will do when she takes them to the back and last but not least calls you personally the next day to see how everything is going. No not a call from the receptionist but from her. I love it. I can imagine going anywhere else after this. If I really had to complain about anything it would have to be the blonde woman at the front desk, you can tell she is disorganized, scatter brained and totally unsure of her self. Shes made me wait before in front of her to make a call to someone about making a mistake in the file, dog marked as a female who was neutered. Please never reveal your mistakes to other customers and never make a phone call over speaking with a client that is already in front of you. Also if you go here and let them know that a current customer sent you TWO great things happen. 1. you get a complimentary Exam and 2. the current customer gets 10 bucks of their next visit!Great food, amazing guacamole you must try it.  Reasonably priced.  Show up before six for happy hour.I wish I had this place on a daily basis. Ginormous, amazing portions of food. We went there twice with 3 - 5 people so we tried 8 - 10 different dishes, all spectacular. The bartender hooked us up with awesome margaritas. We had our photo taken and given a free souvenir postcard :) Every dish was superb, the staff was nice, food came quickly. Yummy chips & salsa beforehand which they generously replenishes. All in all, a wonderful place.I love Sushi Mon!! I go there every time I want all you can eat sushi.  This place is always busy!! But of course I never mind the wait, its well worth it! They have very fresh sushi and a huge selection to choose from! I love sitting at the Sushi Bar and interacting with their Sushi Chefs.  The best part is, when you get all you can eat, there is a huge menu of not only sushi but other dishes you can have along with desert.  I love the mochi balls.   My fav is the strawberry.  For $25 a person, you can't go wrong! Sake Bombs!! Sake Bombs!!  :)  If you don't feel like all you can eat, they do have a very reasonably priced sushi menu!! YUMMMMY!Only place in vegas that I know that offers all you can eat dessert too. I always get my fill of mochi ice cream here.  This is a small interior so it fills up fast. Sushi is super fresh, with nice fish to rice ratio where you are actually eating fish, not rice. If the uni and fresh shrimp is done right, the place is 5 stars in my book.  This was my favorite place until Goyemon opened up, which I only prefer due to location, but is well worth the drive if you want to pig out on ayce mochi ice cream too.We eat here all the time. Literally..We've ordered food here atleast 50 times since we moved here a year ago.  We order here so much that unfortunately I just know that one day I will get tired of there pizza and wings.:-( so after tonight we will be distancing ourselves for atleast 2 months loltoday was my first time going to that clinic, I was surprised with how gentle and hospitable both the nurse and doctor were when interacting with my puppy.We went here this morning for breakfast and it is awesome. My husband loves corn beef hash and he says that's it's the best he has ever had! The staff was very friendly and she even called for us to book a massage! I recommend this place to everyone I know. ThanksCame in for a mani/pedi and was placed with Andy, I was very pleased with his service. He was very attentive, periodically checking to see if I was happy with the length, shape, color and service in general. He paid attention to detail and was very kind, I am extremely happy with my nails and will definitely return to this salon.This place has one of the coolest vibes in Vegas. I took my wife for our anniversary. The service was superb. I had the three course meal for $28 and hot green tea. The app I chose was the shrimp cocktail. It was two huge prawns with a housemade cocktail sauce and fresh lemon-probably the highest quality  in town. Then I had a pancetta and shrimp pasta that was nearly a perfect dish. But the best part was the dessert. The lemon pudding cake was incredible and my wife's chocolate cake was even better than mine!  Everything, even the green tea was simply great and I can't wait to find an excuse to go back.The nicest walmart in Vegas, not nearly enough cashiers or employees (they should hire me, I've applied MANY TIMES) The shelves are always well stocked, I usually run into a sisterwife here or one from their brood! 

Love this store, you'll find me here OFTEN :) and then the Sams is right next door!The best pizza I have tasted period. Glass Nickel pretty much ruined me for any other pizza place. I usually order the MEDITERRANEAN  pizza which is my absolute favorite. I also order the spinach cheese bread very often too, its a great deal for $6.25, its more than a meal for me. My husband and I frequently order the cheese bread and a build your own salad. Did I mention there salads are bomb too. They have really unique pizzas you dont find anywhere else. I have never had a bad meal there and there servers have always been knowledgeable, friendly, and fast. glass Nickel must be a great place to work for too because I have seen the same employees there for years.They have an extensive beer selection and have great drink specials as well. One of the places I eat most at.Well finally trying pizza bianco Been hearing about this place for ever Let's see how it compares to my personal favorite Serious Pie in Seattle The place is small and quant we sat at the bar and started with the veg salad it was excellent with a honey mustered vinaigrette The pizza came and looked great the first bit I tried was the crust it was crisp smokey And a little burnt Heaven!  The second I got was the sauces and cheese and a little basil Outstanding this truly is a great pizza  it's pretty close but I love the crust here  the sauce a little better at serious pie So I guess its a tie ! I guess il have to try both again to determine a winner Stay Tuned !I can never get enough of Durant's  . Maybe it's because of the fifties vibe that make me envision men in dark suits and old ladies with fur stoles. 
Maybe it's the walking into the kitchen with no apologies or awkardness just a big hello and on with the show. I love the traditional food of the place, my succulent shrimp cocktail , oysters  with hottest horseradish know to man , thick meaty prime rib and a lovely lemon drop cocktail that 
begs me to keep sipping away.  The place just symbolizes a different style and era of dining and I love it. If  they get rid of that red velvet flocked wallpaper I will seriously cry .Richardson's is often described as fanastic, but a little pricey. Now I'm not the wealthiest man, but I have to disagree. For the quality of ingredients and the portions that are generous to even a fat man, you can't call Richardson's plates expensive. Not to mention, I usually get something off the Santa Fe Trail side of the menu which is usually $10-$15. Then there's the brunch menu, carrying my favorite enchiladas and eggs. For ten bucks I get a hot manhole cover size plate with two shrimp enchiladas, two eggs, beans, potatoes and green sauce, that's a gift for the money.  There is also a special place in my heart for the GCP, a twice baked sweet potato in a hatch green chili, stunning.Okay, seriously. I'm obsessed. I don't even care about designer brands that much...and I'm obsessed. When I can buy a lingerie top by Vera Wang for less than I can buy one by Xhiliration...yeah, I'm there. 

In fact, I am so there that....(I can't believe I'm about to reveal this)...I have created a spreadsheet. 

A spreadsheet to keep track of my deals. 

Yes. I am for real. And, according to my calculations, I have saved over $2000 in shopping at Last Chance over the last 6 months. 

I don't find something every time I go, but I also go (gulp) every day, with the exception of weekends. I work and live nearby, so it's easy for me to take 45 minutes out of my day and poke around over there. 

I mostly buy tops, shoes, jewelery, and cosmetics. 

Last Chance has a vast, ever-replenishing supply of cute tops. Some are designer, some are just Nordstrom filler brands...about 45% of them are something you might want to buy. The others, you will discard due to condition and personal taste. Tops range from $2.97 - $9.97, and there are often 25% - 50% off "deal days". 

Shoes are also marked way, way down - my current "personal best" shoe bargain is a pair of Kate Spade wedges for $14.99. This takes some digging, but it is almost always worth squeezing through the aisles and taking a look. Keep an eye out for the sales they have on certain color tags - they often mark a random tag color down 50% for a few days out of the week. 

Jewelry and hair accessories are usually not designer, but you can occasionally find something with a recognizable name on it - a few months ago, I found a Marc Jacobs necklace for $9.97. Designer or not, you can find cute stuff for next to nothing, just to fill up your jewelry box. They also have a good, rotating selection of headbands and hair clips, if that's your thing. Be sure to check out the motley displays by the register to increase your chances of finding that special designer necklace or ring on huge clearance. 

It is a little known fact that Last Chance occasionally has jaw-dropping deals on high-end, UNUSED cosmetics. Most of the time when you go in there looking for cosmetics, you'll find a half-empty bottle of crusty tinted moisturizer laying on its side, leaking onto the counter a little bit. Said bottle will be priced at something ridiculous, like $14.97, and you will be disgusted. HOWEVER, every now and again, every once in the bluest of moons, you will walk in the door and find a basket of brand new Stila lip pots. Or maybe Smashbox blushes. Or even Duwop eye palettes... for $.97. Ninety-seven cents. Truly. 

As far as the claims of shopping violence, aggressiveness, and cattiness...I have experienced none of these things. I have also witnessed none of these things, and, like I revealed earlier in this somewhat humbling review, I go every day. Honestly, I don't even feel that the shopping environment is any more competitive than in any other discount retail store. No one has ever snatched anything out of my hands, or tried to get me to move. People are a little pushy, but that happens everywhere - just lock your knees, and stand your ground! 

I never feel stressed out or overwhelmed shopping there, but, then again, I am an old hand at it these days. I took my boyfriend recently, (it was his first time), and he was completely overwhelmed moments after we entered the store. It gets crowded, there are running and screaming kids, and things end up on the floor - welcome to Ross. If you can handle discount shopping elsewhere, you can handle it here. Don't believe the hype, don't fear the horror stories, and soon you, too, will have your own embarrassing bargain tracker spreadsheet.Best Mexican food in Phoenix.  I have lived here for over 25 years and have been around most of the well known Mexican food places  from upscale Scottsdale to dive South barrio.  Via De is the best there is.  Their Pollo Fundido is the best and their burro selection can't be beat.  My favorite dish is the Calupas with a side of grilled corn.  If you are looking for the best Mexican food in a casual family friendly environment or if you like a W I D E variety of Tequilas to choose from, come here

I know they don't serve any IPA's, but hey, Mexican food deserves a Mexican beer or a margarita anyway.Best in town I've been going here for 10 years...  pollo fundido death row meal ...One of my favorite coffee places in scottsdale. I like their smooth and dark espresso roast. The atmosphere is quiet and casual. Excellent place for my meetings.anything, and i mean ANYTHING, that has the words "CHOCOLATE" and "FREE SAMPLES" attached to it automatically gets 5 stars. i mean, how can it not?

there's a free tour in the beginning, after you walk past this little M&M store. the "tour," which was kinda weenie, basically has you walking through a hallway type area where you can see machinery, read about the process and history of chocolate, and view displays of awesome chocolate art. then you exit and there's where you meet the nice lady offering a FREE SAMPLE OF CHOCOLATE! 

when we went, we tried some kind of cinnamon truffle. i'm not a cinnamon person but this one is soooooo good.

the store is a chocolate and souvenir paradise. they package their chocolates in "themes," and we had to get several to try...a lot of them were really good, although i can't remember what their names are.

there's also a cactus garden outside to stroll along. i never knew there were so many different kinds of cacti! really awesome, combining chocolate and cacti! but this is only good if you can stand the vegas heat. if not, chill in the delicious chocolate lounge and splurge on yummy, arty chocolates.I had a decent experience at Stratosphere- both stay and casino!
I booked 2 nights and 3 days, but due to my stupid drunk liver, I had to spend 1 day staying in the bed.
Luckily, I won $120 and something at casino, which led me to extra 1 night at here! great compensation for hangover!
Clean bedroom, bathroom.
Friendly staffs, fine parking lots.
I would definitely stay here again at my next trip to vegas.
I still have 20 hour to stay at here but I already miss this place.
If you are not coming here with your car, might have to walk a bit to the strip.Super good Thai food. Comparable with Ruen Pair in Hollywood.I've been here so many times that my "food I've had here list" would exceed Yelp limits, swears.

Anyways, everything I've had here exceeded expectations but there's always one dish that I tell anyone visiting to get and that's the Garlic Prawns. If you've had it, you know what I mean and if you haven't then you will know what I mean ;) It's a large dish, I say definitely meant to be shared!

This place also gets my vote for the *best buffet* in Vegas. Quality is on par and the price is kinda shocking (because it's so cheap!!!!) Curry is my faaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaav. *drool*

They pretty recently renovated and doubled the size of the place, which I was very happy to see because when I first started going, there was usually a 45 min wait for dinner.

I suggest you high-tail it there asap.As you pull into the strip mall, you're not really sure what to expect!  But let me tell you that you're in for the surprise of your life.

The food was SO yummy!  Satay was delicious.  Bacon wrapped shrimp in a wonton wrapper.... how can you beat that?

The duck and seabass were both great.  And keep in mind that when they say spicy they mean it - an 8 is VERY SPICY.

What a great way to spend a dining experience... only 3/4 mile from Sahara.

Definitely something not to miss and worth the money.  Two for dinner with wine and two appy was abotu $ 100.Best Thai food I've ever had. We came for dinner and it was so good that we grabbed lunch here before we skipped town. 

Service was friendly. They gave good suggestions. 

The hot and sour soup had my mouth on fire for 10 minutes though.One of the best meals I've had in a very long time.  I was on a work trip and I was very pleasantly surprised to stumble upon this place.  Had a bunch of different dishes and one was better than the next.  Plus they have an extensive wine list and everything is very affordable.  A must go!!!I read about this place in Los Angeles magazine and was impressed by what the writer of the article had to say... " I would put Lotus up against anything I've had in the U.S. for Thai food. I'm blown away by the level of execution and consistency of their dishes." (http://www.lamag.com/features-hidden/2013/05/16/vegas-chefs-choice) 

Really now mister fancy chef dude? With all of the top notch Thai places in LA that is a rather bold statement and I decided I must witness such cuisine myself. 

My wife and I are in Vegas and we decide to make the trek from the strip to this place that is located in an oddball shopping center. We saw the place and were skeptical... we walked in and our nostrils were immediately welcomed by delicious Thai aromas. Skepticism melted away as we walked past the bunch of people waiting around for a table. We put our name down and the wait was long - I wish we had made a reservation. That right there folks is the only gripe I have.

When the hostess took us to our table she warned us that since they are busy the wait for our food might be lengthy. At that point we had already invested too much time to turn back and after looking at all of the yelp reviews we were ready to try this stuff, so that warning did not detour us. We were then greeted by a friendly waiter and he took our drink and food orders efficiently. The hostess' warning turned out to be unnecessary as our food came out in a very reasonable amount of time. 

Okay, enough semantics. The FOOD. Oh, the glorious food. The drunken noodles with soft-shell crab were stunning. I took the first bite and I felt my eyes pop out of my head. The flavors were so amazing! Then the panang curry with crispy duck was unbelievable. I've had "crispy duck" before and never, never in my life has it been as delightfully crispy as it is here. Perfection!  

My wife and I dine at some pretty spectacular places when we are in Vegas and we have talked about this meal more than any other. I will certainly be returning to this place each and every time I go to Vegas. So, yes. Mister fancy chef dude's bold statement is absolutely valid. Yes, I too am blown away by their amazing Thai food!Best Thai food we have ever eaten!
The sausage itself, encompasses all the flavors of this magnificent country.The food was absolutely delicious. I swear it was almost orgasmic. I didn't want to go to the burger bar at first but I decided to go when I found out about the dessert. Let me tell you, I was NOT disappointed. The black angus burger and fries were so good. I had the chocolate burger for dessert and it was so cute (I didn't eat though because I was full). 

If you plan to go, wear loose clothing because when you leave, your stomach will be bursting XD.What hasn't already been said about this place? 

I can honestly say that their kobe burger(named after the great Kobe Bryant.  lol jp) is the best damn burger I have eaten in my 25 years of existence. Prior to dining at this gem, I'd be damned if I would pay 20 bucks for a slab of beef between a bun. But I've never had hamburger meat literally melt in my mouth. DamN!

I'd gladly pay it over and over again if I werent 300 miles away   =(

The salmon burger is the bomb too!I have seen a lot of magic shows and this is he best one I've ever seen. Penn & Teller are true students of magic and theatre and it shows. While they may refer to what they do as 'tricks,' they are much more like mini-plays. Each routine tells its own story.

If you want to be wowed by large props, bright lights, smoke and loud music...then this show is NOT for you. If you want to be truely amazed and learn something at the same time, then thi sshow IS for you.

The theatre was nice but no over the top. The jazz music before the show was very good. Penn and Teller also stay after the show to take pictures and sign autographs. 

One of the best shows in Vegas!Awesome show, worth the price.  I plan to go again and pay more to suit closer.

We sat literally in the very back row and could see and enjoy the show. The only negative was its at the Rio, which is off the strip and doesn't have any good restaurants.This was a great show. I have always wanted to see them. I have seen them on TV a few times but never in person. I was coming to Vegas with my beautiful girlfriend and when we talked about going to see a show I suggested this one and she said yes let's go.
What a good choice. I like the jazz duo that open the show. They are very good. Mike Jones is an amazing piano player. I think it is funny how most of the audience didn't seem to realize who was playing the stand up bass. Right at the start they have a bulletin border with an envelope posted on it and an empty wooden box on stage. They ask that you go on stage and check out the box and sign the envelope. I thought that was pretty cool. I also like the fact the my awesome girlfriend got us seats right down front. You really can see a lot more when you are upfront. They were great seats.
I really liked the fact that it wasn't this big fancy magic show with laser lights and smoke and all of the stuff. It was simple and about the tricks not some crazy flashy stage show. They do some great illusions and slight of hand tricks. A few times you think they are explaining the trick to you but they are still tricking you.
I don't want to give too much away but trust me it was a great show and I would go back to see it again. They are very entertaining. Very funny.
It is also great that they both go out to the lobby right after the show to take pictures with everyone. They are very nice and get to everyone. Just be patient and wait your turn. They won't run away. They will get to everybody.
This really is one of the best shows in Vegas and it is no surprise that they have been there for 13 years and counting.NO seats even with 2 day notice, but bar area has seating with full menu available. We arrived opening 5pm and claimed seats right away. Coffee rubbed filet was awesome - very earthy and cooked perfectly rare. 6 spice chicken was one of the best things I've ever had. Small portion - but PERFECT. nick kick to it too. Twice baked potato was only complaint - good, but I love the skin and it was too dry and crispy. Banana cream pie was awesome.Green chile burger was delicious at lunch.  The appetizer was very good as well.  Service was good. We had no complaints.What a great place. The prices are just right, and the food is fresh and delicious. My friend and I shared two appetizers: crab rangoon and summer rolls. I don't usually order crab rangoon, because it always seems like something taken out of the freezer and thrown in the deep fryer. Not so here! They were light, crispy, and just the right amount of greasiness. They definitely tasted fresh. We shared an order of squash curry with tofu, which was amazing. We asked for 2.5 star-level spiciness, which was perfect. Hot enough to give you a buzz, but not so hot that you need to take breaks while eating. The service was excellent too. I wish I could go back today, but they're unfortunately closed on Sundays!!Argus is where it's at! 

They're menu is never-ending, with a wide variety of vegetarian options to choose from.

Exceptionally friendly interaction between the employees and their patrons. Argus has a sort of Cheers feel to it. They could use a bit more space to accommodate such a fantastic crowd of people, though.Great local restaurant! Diner-ish experience. I love the grilled cheese, but everything I've had has been consistantly good. Don't forget the pie for dessert!Memorial Union is important in defining the Madison experience. Great place to study and grab eats/drinks for students during the school year. Amazing place to relax and enjoy the scenery during the spring and summer. I miss my summer filled lazy days at the union. This place will always be loved.I love this place!! It has not changes for 20 years!!! Crazy I know. 

The story behind this fantastic little martini/restaurant bar is that it is owned by Karl Kopps from Milwaukee, WI and it has sister bar in Milwaukee that is called Elsa's. Both have the same vibe and menus. What's interesting is that the artwork rotates from place to place and keeps the vibe changing. 

I highly recommend the burger!  Yes, I said BURGER... as in Hamburger!  It's awesome. Therefore, kick back and savor a martini while chilling to good tunes and munching on a hand-packed piece of Americana! 

The bottom line: if your looking for a chic little place that always has a a great vibe. Than this is your spot. 

PS. Be prepared to wait for a table or come early as they so get packed!!Sweet little shop, great service, great location and awesome espresso. Try their cappuccino it's deliciousI went to the movies and had a great time and the young lady in the snack area named Gaby was very nice and friendly and made the experience way better... I appreciate great customer service and she executed it very wellWe at first had a ok experience than it went down hill from there. Didn't get checked on in over 20 mins. After our waitress came and check on us we told her about our Facebook check in for a free beer. She told us she had to get a manager to verify it. We watched her walk to the manager and he went somewhere else grabbed fries and walked right past us. We were pissed off by that. Than we asked for a different manager and ny this time we were really mad and yelling. A new manager band Mike came and helped us. Took care of us. I know it was a busy time when we got there but Mike still took time out of the busy day to help us. He turned a bad experience into a good one.This is one fun place!

Go and experience it for yourself!

Go now!As a special trip, we splurged and got a Bellagio partial Lake View Suite which cost a ton but was a once in a lifetime sort of thing for us. We both loved the room. Huge layout with three bathrooms total. His a her bathrooms with giant hot tub, giant steam shower, power drapes with a incredible view of the fountains, giant screen HD TV's, mini bar, sitting area and super fine service. Fist time I have ever had a room with a door bell. It was like a condo. With this room you get VIP status with private limos from and to the airport, special line passes for the taxi and restaurant lines and a private executive lounge with all sorts of drinks and goodies. They will service your room twice a day if you like with a turn down service in the evening. We spent as much time as possible in the room and were sorry to go. What an experience. Would do it again.I love the Bellagio! I stay here every year for a week-long work conference, and look forward to it all year. When I come out on vacation and stay with friends, I always end up here for a drink, or to play a little Blackjack.. or even walk through the flower display.

The Bellagio hotel has more people staying the night every night than the total population of the town I grew up in. Seriously. It's a great place to sit and people watch (I recommend one of the comfy chairs by Jean Philippe's Patisserie.) The fountains are a must see.. with shows running on a regular schedule to a changing music selection.

Bellagio.. it's the definition of Vegas!They saved us from the dreaded Luxor! 

Liza at the lobby desk, Rich at the American Bar - the first two NYNY staffers my sister and I came across made us NYNYers for life. 

We thought we had better save some cash and try Luxor, got bad directions to our room and (an hour later) almost threw up walking into the room. GROSS. Dirty! SICK! WTH is this doing on the strip?? And who knew?? 

After getting our money back and heading to NYNY the rest of our trip was perfect. Every encounter with staff was excellent. The room with the view was more than we could ask for and the entire hotel had everything we needed we really didn't have to go anywhere else. Piano Bar and Pizza were our fav's. 

From the Slimko Sisters, Thank you for saving our trip and give Liza and Rich raises! Or at least a high-five for making you shine :) 

Cheers, kLove staying here. It's a little smaller than most trip casinos but the ambience and amazing restaurants make up for it.This was the most expensive meal I ever had, but it was also probably the most delicious. Three of us shared an eight-course menu crafted to suit our dietary needs (they are very gluten free friendly) and preferences. The fish and scallops were so incredibly fresh. The only negative is they should go easier on the finishing salt.Zumanity is by far the best Cirque de Soleil show I have seen. 

My girl friend and I went to the 10 PM show on 10-8-13.  Once we got inside the lobby we picked up a drink at the bar called "The BIG Jimmy" and for 24 bucks this drink lasted the whole show.

Zumanity was packed with SeXy people (guys and girls), AwEsOmE stunts, and plenty of crowd interaction.

We went in with a open mind and has a blast!  But, If you get offended easily... this show is NOT FOR YOU.  

NOTE: Get in early for the pre-show.  Doors open half an hour before the actual show starts.Very nice. It might not be perfect but it gets 5 stars for simply being an experience that EVERYONE should have in vegas. It's a really nice place with really nice rooms and have stands successfully as a truly unique experience. This is a hotel that doesn't need to copy any other hotels.

I recommend this great experience to all. Oh yea, lots of good looking people here...hehe.we had such a great time in the room...love the curtains that block out ALL sunlight!!Right after I walked in and looked up...I was impressed.  

The decor is beautiful, classical and grand...  I especially love their rendition of the Sistine Chapel ceiling and the art filled shopping area.

The suites are also very nice and spacious with a seperate sunken living room area.

The Venetian definitely has alot of charm and I wouldn't mind staying here again...This is not what Venice really looks like, effin' liars! Nevertheless The Venetian is charming, and beautiful and elegant, and just might be the next best thing. Everything about this place is perfect, and you can see that just by walking around. 

Rooms are huge, a bit pricey, but not extreme, and the service is impeccable. 

Even if you can't afford to stay in the hotel, or you'd rather stay somewhere less expensive to save for other Vegas-adventures, you can still enjoy what The Venetian has to offer, even a gondola ride. The shops, well, that really does remind me of Venice somehow. The canal, the gondoliers, the sky-painted ceiling. There is a bit of Venetian magic there.Great hotel, great location, large rooms. Lots of things to do around the hotel and the grand lux restaurant is a treat affordable place to eat with a large menu. It's basically a cheese cake factory rebranded.My husband and I and our 18-year-old daughter wanted to get away for a couple of days midweek to celebrate both their birthdays.  We booked the least expensive room at the Venetian.  On previous trips we had stayed at the Bellagio and wanted to see what another hotel would be like.  

From the moment we arrived in the beautiful lobby, we knew this was the right place to be.  We were pleasantly surprised to find that our room was spacious and lovely, even for three of us.  My daughter slept on a pull out sofa for no extra charge and said it was perfectly comfortable.  Our king size bed was wonderful.  We also could not hear any noise through the walls or in the hallway each night we slept there.  

When we opened the curtains, we had absolutely no view, but since we weren't there to stay and admire the scenery it didn't matter to us.  A plus was being on the fourth floor, which is the same floor as the pool.  All around very accommodating, extra towels handed to you as you enter the area.  There are plenty of lounge chairs and it was not hard to find a place to sit, unlike some hotels where there aren't enough for all the guests and people "save" them all day with their belongings on top.  

My brother and his teenage son also came along on this trip, and although they asked for a non-smoking room, the previous guests apparently puffed away.  They were offered another room right away, but decided to stay in that room because they were tired.  The hotel put some kind of ionizer in the room and within a couple of hours the smoke smell was gone.  We asked for extra blankets and a few others things while we were there and everything arrived very quickly. 

 Another plus is the valet area in front of the hotel.  It was very easy and not time-consuming to wait for your car.  This is one of my complaints about the Bellagio Hotel, by the way.  While it is a beautiful hotel, you could die and have your funeral in the time it takes them to retrieve your car, and waiting in their covered, underground-ish valet area in the summer might hasten your demise.  

Getting back to the Venetian, the casino areas were not overwhelmingly smoky like some of the other hotels.  For a restaurant meal the first night (hubby's birthday) we asked the hotel to recommend something.  We wanted a nice but not extravagant dinner.  They recommended First Bar and Grill.  When we found it, we thought, "Aha, they are recommending this because it is away from the shops and gondolas so probably these restaurants need more business."  There were only a few other diners.  Well, it turned out to be the best meal we had on the trip, with lovely, friendly, attentive service.  I had the coconut red snapper which was a thick flaky large chunk of perfectly cooked fish, with an amazing curry sauce.  My brother had a steak which he liked, and hubby and daughter both had fish and chips.  

The second night we ate at Postrito, the Wolfgang Puck cafe in San Marco Square, also very good.  The only negative about that was altho' while making the reservation I had said it was my daughter's birthday, instead of giving us a nice table where we could easily see the singers and performers they sat us in the back.  

For breakfast both days we ate at Bouchon up on the 10th floor, where we all said we had the best breakfast in years both times.  (Coffee not quite hot enough, tho').  The eggs poached medium were amazing.  If you get them on the brioche the butter sauce sinks into the brioche, but if you get them with a baguette (better choice), the eggs come sitting in the butter sauce with the baguette on the side.  They make their own butter.  Surprisingly, ordering a la carte was less expensive.  Even my fussy daughter was happy with her choice, the sourdough waffles.  My nephew had the French Toast, which was served like a custard with caramelized apples inside.

 All in all, a wonderful stay.  Everyone from the bellmen to the valets to the waitstaff and so on were a class act.  Will stay there next time, and prefer this atmosphere to the very nice but not-as-much-fun Bellagio.Unbelievable. Delmonico's was an unforgettable experience from start to finish.  We went there with a group of six to celebrate a 30th birthday. We called two days in advance to make a reservation (you can do it on their website too).  

We arrived and were seated immediately and it was then that I realized that it would be a dining experience. We had 4-5 servers around out table at any given time. We were immediately served water, delicious little bread knots, and out drink orders were taken. I thought it was interesting that they did not give a drink menu, rather the server recited all drinks in the given category to each person (wines: red or white, beers: IPA or Stout etc). Then they reviewed the menu with us and took our orders. There were many specials available, and they brought us a sample of a cheese tomato pesto flat bread, on the house. 

The meal took a good 20 minutes, but it was worth every second (and dollar!). I had a filet, which was prepared to perfection. Sides are a la carte, and family style. The green beans, potatos au gratin, and country smashed potatoes were to die for. Very very delicious.

This is hard to imagine, but the servers were almost too hovering. They filled your water after one or two sips. They definitely took care of us to any need. The prices are high, but worth it. Delmonico's is something I will always remember about Vegas.T me Delmonicos earns a five star rating for two reasons.  For one, I've never had a bad experience eating there... Their food and service has always exceeded my expectations.  Secondly, their Pan Seared Foie Gras literally took my breath away because I was enjoying it so much I damn near forgot to breath.  That is saying a lot because normally I don't like liver!  For a quick recommendation, try their filet mignon, duck or ask for their filet medallions, it is off the menu but the flavor is amazing.

For a full review read my post at:
http://foodilistic.com/reviews/delmonicos-las-vegas/Great food, amazing service. A must have when in Vegas.This place is awesome, girls everywhere, location is cool. The pool, lazy river was amazing. Overall had a great stay, they renovated all there rooms.This continues to be my favorite bar of all time!!!  And that's saying a lot since I'm half irish, half cherokee and all drinker.  The drinks here are super cheap, one vodka redbull, one black russian, and two buds ran me $20.  How great is that?  Even better, they had a punk rock elvis cover band.  Where else can you hear a punked out version of Suspicious Minds?  If I could I would move in here.My favorite bar in Vegas hands down. 
They have Fernet, High life, rad bartenders and a kick ass jukebox.
Met some really cool people here this weekend. Oh, the drinks are cheap too.
I will for sure be making the Double Down a mandatory stop every time I am in L.V.A true gem in the city of sin!  This is the best dive bar I have ever been to and I found it thanks to Anthony Bourdain. The bacon martini was great, and so was the ass juice!  Friendly people, and a friendly bartender. I'll be back next time I'm in town!******NOT RATING THE HOTEL, I AM REVIEWING THE CHAPEL!**********

- Look, imperial isn't very good looking. They are remodeling.  If your on a tight budget, your doing things yourself, want to be affordable and still have some style, this is the place. Yes I know,  hotel is getting remodeled so calm down. I got married in the skyline chapel. It's great. It's like walking into the twilight zone. You go from ugly remodeling casino to a beautiful wedding chapel! For the money it's great! 75ish seats beautiful dress up , great staff! It was affordable here to get married! It looks like the picture online too with the blue lights. So if your getting married, your on a budget, but you want something nice check out the Skyline Chapel! For real! They have a dj for the ceremony, officiant, and on site cordinator. I loved it, Need pics - let me know. We went small on the wedding and going big on the Honeymoon. CheersSat on patio and watched Bellagio's water show while eating. Was amazing! Great view. Try the filet mignon or the steak with bleu cheese atop... very goodOn this beautiful sunny day, we made our stop at this famed restaurant again.  I love everything about this restaurant!

We had steak sandwich, great!
We had smoked salmon open face sandwich, delish!
We are home now, my kid still talk about their smoked salmon.  

When I think about this restaurant, I think about white gossamer, elegant tea set, pink  petti-tutu, purple haze lavender... Such a romantic place!

Mon Ami Gabi, I am forever ur fan!I am a big food snob and I know it. This restaurant delivers in both service, although a bit slow, and food. I highly suggest you give it a try. Ask for Isabelle, sit outside and enjoy. The chicken liver mousse is just divine! I also tried the gazpacho a friend had and found it perfect. For an entree I had the frisee salad with warm bacon and a poached egg on top. The entire dish was simply amazing, the egg perfectly poached and delish! My partner had the prime burger with brie, it was Cooked to perfection and tasty too. I hardly ever give 5 stars but this delightful restaurant surely deserves it!Three of us had the steak frite - fantastic!  Reasonable prices and a great meal.Always love this place.  Year after year...you can't go wrong with any item on the menu.

Best kept secret: puréed cauliflower...Wow!  I wanted to take gallons home with me last time I went, and I'm not even a cauliflower fan!Long story short, last night there was fabulous and could not have been more perfect!

My wife said all things considered, it might be the best dining experience she's ever had. That is saying a lot. We've dined at nice and quite expensive restaurants all over the country. None of them matched  Mon Ami Gabi for the totality of the experience.

My wife and I both had steaks that were quite flavorful and done exactly as we requested. I had onion soup which was rich and flavorful, and all the sides especially the pommes frites were wonderful. Ymmm...

My wife loved the Châteauneuf-du-Pape wine. Don't let the price scare you off it is wonderful and worth every cent. My wife worked in high end private clubs a number of years ago and remembered it from then. It was so good she went for a second glass.

The service was also marvelous. High marks to Matthew Dunaway our server.  He had the perfect combination of menu knowledge, timing, was appropriately engaging and completely professional. He made it a very enjoyable evening for us. Great guy, ask for him !

The al fresco dining is the best way to enjoy an evening there in my opinion. You get a great view of the surrounding area, the Bellagio fountains, the Eiffel tower and the colorful crowd walking below.

We'll make sure we go there on every future trip!

 I suggest you do as well. This business really cares about their customers and that is refreshing to find.Tacky spectacularness!!!!!!!!!!!!  

Jacuzzi firepits... Velvet booths... Neon lighting piping through the mirrored walls... This place is Vegas at it's finest.

I was first introduced to The Peppermill back in 2003 by my cousin's friend who swore it was the only place to go in Vegas for breakfast.  5 years later and I have to go at least once a trip every time I'm up there.

Honestly, the food is just typical diner fare.  I can't say there's a stand out in the food category besides the fact that the portions are GINORMOUS!  The thing I make sure to order every time is their signature Bloody Mary.  It goes down soooooooo easily after a good night in Vegas.

Go for the cheesefactor, if not for anything else.  I swear, you'll be stoked that you did.This place is A-OK. We only stopped by briefly for a drink at the bar but I loved this place! It reminds me of a New Jersey diner. It brought me right back home. 

There's fire pits and these pretty water fountains. An average but cool bar. 

We ordered two drinks from their custom menu. I had their Godiva martini--It's to die for! and my husband had a guy drink.

We will return late night again to check out their food because I heard MANY good things :)Most of the time I come to Vegas I stay at Luxor because I the price isn't too high, they don't charge from extra guest, it's on the strip, modern, has 2 clubs, a bunch of exhibits, cars, restaurant, shows and a big casino floor.  The rooms are spacious and has a nice shower.  The TV aren't to fancy, but we have a great view of the strip. The guest service is great, but the valet gets a little bossy at times.I have something to confess, I think I'm a gay man trapped inside the body of a straight girl -- I LOVE THIS MAN!

I must admit, I grew up with my Mom playing the piano with all of these *Liberace Favorites*  piano books lying around. We watched him in awe on the TV. (hey, I'm a kid from the 70's!) Simply amazing. 

So once I was in Vegas with my Dad, & I was DYING to go to this museum, but bummed it was off the strip. So I begged, and away we went! 

This man invented BLING! He knew how to accessorize anything and everything, right down to his piano & even the cars he showed up in. I'm so happy for all the artifacts he saved to make this museum, and he picked the perfect place on Earth too! Land of excess brought to you by Liberace. 

I promptly  ran to the gift store to pick up my Liberace *Legends of the Fridge* magnet with a patriotic sequins outfit, and with HOT PANTS on no less! God I love that man!This is truly a resort destination in Las Vegas. The theme is very exotic beach and many of the restaurants reflect Pan-Asian cuisine. 

Junior suites are the perfect size for relaxation. The rooms are designed as if you are in a high-end beach resort in a far away land. Make sure to pair your stay with an extended treatment at the spa. I had a seaweed salt rub in the past while my brother, a massage therapist, experienced one of the best deep tissue massages of his career.

Food experiences are phenomenal with a famous wine "cave" located on the premises. Late night dealers are more than happy  to give lessons for the games less known. The killer feature is the fake beach area with the lagoon entrance style pools and wave pool and the mini waterways...Fun for everyone while feeling like you are not necessarily in Vegas.made reservations for 5:15pm (the earliest they could seat you) because we had to catch a 7:30pm show in new york new york. 

They seated us right away and we were given a menu. We ordered the prosciutto ($14) for appetizer, which was basically a ginormous plate full of proscuitto slices. For some reason I thought it was going to be served with something else, not just plain prosciutto. However, it was the best tasting prosciutto I had in my life, recalling back to the taste of fresh ham from my childhood in Bolivia, though thinner and chewier, and possibly fresher. 

entree: I ordered the bison ($39), and my bf ordered the kobe flat iron steak ($58, if i remember correctly). The bison was tastier than beef. I chose it because I read it on yelp somewhere that bison is just really good. I thought I'd try it at Tom's restaurant so I could blame him if it sucked. It didn't. It was juicy, tender, lean, and it had a kick to it. My bf's kobe was a hit. He said that it doesn't hit you (how good it is) until you're about to swallow. I'd say the taste and texture of kobe definitely develops as you chew it. Perhaps next time, we can try the wagyu (still have yet to try it).

For sides, we got the yukon mashed potatoes ($11), and the asparagus ($11). Next time, I'd just get the mashed potatoes and save myself an extra $11. The asparagus was great, too, but it wasn't to die for like the prosciutto or the mashed potatoes (which also tasted like my childhood mashed potatoes that were made with fresh cow milk and loads of butter).

Our server asked us what kind of wine, if any, we would like to pair with our steak. I asked him what went well with bison, since I never had it before. He suggested the pinot noir. I personally like zinfandel with everything so he gave me samples of each to taste (I chose the zinfandel, $17). My bf sampled the merlot and the shiraz and went with the shiraz ($18). 

The total bill was $204, tax & tip included.

the experience? priceless. I'd say this is the best steak house we've gone to so far. 

The only pet peeve I have is eating a steak that gets colder and colder as you eat. I'm sure there is SOME way to combat that, considering that some steakhouses serve your steak on 500 degree plates or cast iron skillets that are still hot. 

We told our server that we had a show to catch and we were out by 6:45pm. However, the wait time for our food was about 45 minutes. We're not the most patient people but I think this is somehow normal in vegas.

I'd totally go back, and with more money next time.Went here last night and had a great time. Service was very friendly and attentive. Our table went with the Summer Tasting Menu which was the way to go in terms food and price. For sixty dollars we got the following:

1st Course:
Grilled Quail
Watercress and Cucumber Salad
Roasted Red Peppers

Main Course:
Diver Scallops in Citrus Butter
Kobe Rib Eye x2
Roasted Chicken

Dessert:
Molten Chocolate Cake
6 Different Types of Ice Cream and Sorbet (Coconut was the Best)
Fresh Fruit
Monkey Bread

We also add Fore Grais, Corn Soup, and Oysters to our meal and they all were excellent. This is the place to come for simple, perfectly prepared food.I'm not even sure what I can say about Craftsteak that hasn't been said. This place has AWESOME food. It's totally worth every penny, like everyone says. My husband and I had the fall/winter tasting menu ($70/pp) which you have to now ask for (it was that popular that they don't talk about it on their menus anymore, so be sure and ask!) and you literally get to try everything they mention on the menu. I've never been anywhere that did that before, usually you have to choose your "app, entree & dessert" out of a few choices. It was great to be able to try it all! The wait service was one of the best I've had at any restaurant in my life. They kept bringing out more and more food, I couldn't believe it! Definitely a place where you get the most bang for your buck. We had 4 salads (a fennel salad, mozzarella salad, quail and cranberry salad, and a cucumber salad), 3 entrees (two kinds of steak, both cooked perfectly, and giant scallops, also cooked perfectly), 3 sides (the great potato puree everyone talks about, some awesome braised brussel sprouts, and braised mushroom medley), and two desserts (lava cake and monkey bread). I've never eaten so much in my life, but it was so worth it. Also, the hostess heard me mention (totally off-hand, she asked why we were in Vegas) that it was our anniversary, and they gave us the lava cake as an extra dessert for our anniversary (complete with "happy anniversary" piped on the plate in chocolate, yum!) What awesome service! I highly recommend Craftsteak for the service, the ambiance (nice low-lit booths, very romantic), and OF COURSE the food. Eat here if you can! :) Definitely in my top 5 best meals of all time.one of the best steakhouses i have ever eaten at. if you're going with a group of 4 and money is no object, i'd suggest doing the kobe tasting menu. it's 3 courses but the amount of food is so generous. especially the desserts. personally, i don't think the upgrade to surf and turf is worth it. unless it's a 2 pound lobster tail or the sea scallops. sometimes the prawns and crab legs surf options are little too rich because of the butter poaching. my favorite thing on the menu is the kobe skirt. also if you like your whiskey on the rocks, the restaurant has an icemaker that makes a 2 1/2 square inch cube.This is just a phenomenal place and the service is super. This place is on fire. Great decor. The bar tenders and wait staff are literally running to make sure the food reach your table warm and fresh.They make all the tortillas and tortillas chips in house. Comes to your table warm. Totally delish was the lobster taco served with the lobster cooked and served in its shell and the Bacon wrapped stuffed jalapeños. Can't say enough about the Diablo Nachos made with Scorpion chili cheese sauce and habanero beans. It will set you on fire but the burn it great. Make sure to order with cold beer. Big shout out to the bar tender Brian who was doing an amazing job.Keller has game - no question.
Fois gras - heart attack enough for a whole family - delicious.
Scallops - really fresh and tasty.
Chicken - up with the best I've had
Maccheroni au gratin - very good.
french fries - very good but not world bending.
The Julienas had a bit to much alcohol for my tastes.  I prefer the regular bottling, not the reserve (Pascal Granger)This is how it should be done.

I have eaten at several Thomas Keller establishments around the country, and while in Vegas for a convention, I decided to escape the endless corporate buffets I had been subsiding on all week and seek out something a little more satiating.  I managed to con one of my co-workers into coming with me; she was very pregnant at the time.  I was a little bit concerned as it has been my experience in many Las Vegas 'clone' haute cuisine restaurants that the price is certainly high, the food is passable, and the service can be abysmal.

The restaurant is in the Venetian, and is a beautiful recreation of a French Bistro.  Black and white tile floors and nice display cases show off the pastries and the fruits de mer.  We were seated immediately and were engaged by the server in very short order.

He was fantastic, I wish I could remember his name, but he was truly passionate about the food and very knowledgeable.  He was very quick to supply my colleague with some fresh bread of her choosing to satisfy her needs.  He also was well-versed in wines and was able to explain menu items to my dining companion, who was a fine-dining novice, in terms that did not intimidate or patronize her.

My first course was the charcuterie plate, which was fantastic.  A very healthy portion of a number of fresh, house-made sausages and confit with some amazing pickles and spreads.  They were also generous with the mini-baguettes, I hate it when charcuterie plates are stingy with bread.

For the second course, I went with the waiter's recommendation of a platter of a half-dozen or so oysters, again, very great suggestions and very fresh.

For my main course, I had the short ribs, which evaporated into rich, meaty love in my mouth.  The waiter paired up a fantastic red to go along with it, played off the marrow perfectly.  One of the best servings of short ribs I've ever had, including my own, which I can make pretty damn well.

For dessert, we had a selection of pastries, among them profiteroles, which were perfect with the very fresh dark coffee they served me with it.  The waiter was kind enough to call an ambulance which whisked me away after I entered a post-dinner food coma.

A fantastic meal, with fantastic service - I don't hand out fives frequently, but am proud to give this establishment that honor.I'm in love! I'm super thankful for the awesome Bouchon staff that was able to accommodate me for a quick and delicious Sunday Brunch before I left Vegas on a jet plane.

I told the host that I needed to be quickly seated and out of the Restaurant in less than 50 minutes. The host told me that I could immediately be seated at the bar, which I found my way just fine. The server was extra attentive to my needs and understood the immediacy of my visit. He recommended a few dishes and even the Manager (so i think it was) came to the table to let me know that their French Toast could be made immediately. 

I decided to take my chances on time and go with the Salmon Baguette and the Yogurt Parfait. They also served a complimentary twisty bread with jam and butter. Mmm...! Everything was so neatly displayed and delicious. Don't you just LOVE brunch time?

Anyway, to keep it short, Bouchon was fab and the service was exceptional! They even bumped my order to the top of the list to get me out of the Restaurant on time. I will definitely visit Bouchon again try out other items from their menu without having to be in a rush.

Je t'aime Bouchon. Je t'aime.Have been coming here once or twice a year and I am always being treated like a king. The Sommelier Paul is exceptional and always send a nice bottle our way.
Quality wise, the restaurant retains the great food and most of all service.
I guess that is why most of the employees  are still here. I am surprised at some of the reviews here, as we never had a bad experience at Bouchon.
If you come to LV make sure you try it. Try the oysters, grilled octopus salad, foir gras and my fav steak frites!
Try it and enjoy!!!I had made reservations at Olives for my friend's birthday because she's never seen the water show at Bellagio, and what a better way to see it than from your dining table on the patio overlooking the entire lake? I had booked reservations for 5pm but we were running late, and I called the restaurant to let them know and they were totally ok with it. When we got there I requested patio seating and it wasn't a problem at all, which was great because I was worried that we wouldn't get one based on reviews. You can't reserve specifically where you sit via phone/web, you have to ask when you get there. Thank goodness for us they had one available!

Because it is summer and weather in vegas is ridiculously hot, they had mist things on outside, so you get a little damp from the water. but i think that's ok cuz i'd rather be a little damp and cool than sweating my ass off.

When we were seated the waiter immediately came over to take drink requests and with our menus. He was super friendly and courteous, which I appreciated very much. He was quick to bring us our drinks and the bread with olive tapenades, which were AMAZING. He was helpful with deciphering some of the items on the menu as well, and when we ordered, was quick to bring out our food. Just so efficient! And when our food came out the water show was going on so we didn't touch our food yet, and he came over concerned that there may be something wrong with our food that we weren't happy about and wanted to know if there was anything he could do! He was truly the best.

So, my friend and I shared the Tempura-Fried Soft Shelled Crab, the Fig & Prosciutto Flatbread, and Parmesan fries. All were delicious. I'm not a big fan of crustaceans, but the Crab was amazing! The flatbread was a little too salty for my taste, but still delicious nonetheless. The fries were good as well. My other friend ordered the Ricotta Ravioli, which seemed good as well.

Because I had informed them that the dinner was for a friend's birthday, they came out with a trio of truffles for her at the end of our meal, with "happy birthday" written in dark chocolate on top. So beautiful! the three truffles were placed on top of caramel sauce, and i think they were key lime, peanut butter and jelly, and dark chocolate. We each sampled one and they were SO GOOD. 

Overall, an excellent experience. The staff was great, food was great, ambiance was fabulous. I can't wait to go again =)Service was good, Scenery is fantastic (Bellagio Water Show), Decor is elegant. Drinks we're good AND strong. I felt for the price the food could've been more flavorful and appetizing, but it definitely isn't bad, I just had high expectations. But Overall, I enjoyed my evening here.This restaurant is the bomb. The risotto is probably the best in the United States. It just melts in your mouth. It is so delicious. The service was good also. You must try this place if you are craving French food.No need to write more than what others have posted. Tom is a great server and we enjoyed our dinner. We will be back...top notch service and food. This is Vegas at its best.It's worth the price tag! Yummy treats that leave your taste buds wanting more. The service is excellent!Easily the most expensive meal I've ever had but well worth it. The service was amazing and the wine suggestions from the sommeliers were perfect. The servers were attentive, fun and helped make the experience. 

Amuse Bouche:
Foie gras soufflé with an edible marigold flower. I specifically came to Le Cirque to try foie gras for the first time so I was excited that it was the very first course. It was amazing! 

Appetizer:
Sautéed foie gras with this light puff pastry bread with pears. Easily the most delicious thing I've ever put in my mouth and would return just for that dish. My friend got the lobster risotto which was cooked perfectly and had a bit of spice. Also delicious. 

Dinner:
Milk fed veal with the crispest asparagus tips I've ever had and black pepper mashed potatoes. I ordered my veal medium rare and my friend ordered hers rare and both came out cooked perfectly. Perfect portion sizes and just delicious. 

Dessert: 
I had the Tahitian vanilla bean creme brûlée. It was easily the best creme brûlée I've ever had but the Tahitian vanilla didn't really taste different from any other vanilla. Just my opinion. My friend had some fruit sorbet cream thing that came out in an ice bowl so the presentation was much nicer than the actual taste. 

It's a once in a lifetime experience that I highly recommend for everyone who has $300 to throw away on a meal. I'm a total foodie and will remember this meal for the rest of my life.The Crystal Corner should impress, as the place has grown on me after being a regular patron for only a matter of months.  I'm usually very picky when it comes to bars, and few of them enter my 4/5 star league.  The Crystal Corner is also not the typical bar I would frequent, but it has all the right elements to just make it one of those places worth being at.

What amazes me the most about it is the variety of ages and personalities.  On a typical weekend night you're bound to see everyone from the punk gother, the trendy hipster, the preppy 20-somethings, the middle-aged cougars, and the averge joes.  There's a good reason why everyone is there though, and its that the setup and atmosphere is perfect.  From music that is almost always spot on for your mood and at the perfect volume (sure that's all relative but it just seems right to almost everyone there), to a long circular bar where you can schmooze with your electric peers, the Crystal Corner has got it going on.

The bar itself definitely resembles the typical neighborhood bar as others on yelp have mentioned, with a few TVs and an old hand-me-down feel.  But aside from that, it's unique in almost every other aspect and promotes good times.  If you get bored of just socializing and having drinks, they have a few pool tables where you're bound to catch a game, and darts for those of you who like to do that sort of thing.  Prices for drinks are reasonable, although nothing here nor there.

The only drawbacks that I'd say (and nothing to take away a star) are the lack of comfortable chairs and the always busy bartender.  If you can deal with that, you're in for a treat.I love the variety of beers and food. Great, friendly and helpful bartenders. Reasonable prices and fun ambiance make this a fav when I'm in Madison.If you love burgers than you should eat here at least one time, especially if you love sweet potato fries!

Just get their standard issue burger with a "basket" of sweet potato fries.  Literally, it's a shopping cart basket filled with their fries.  It comes with this orange sauce that's amazing.  They'll cook your burger any way you want it so if you're the kind of person who wants the beef still mooing, they'll bring you the cow.The first time I came here I was impressed by the fact they let you try everything before you order. I decided on the emerald chicken and jade chicken with the black beans and the jerk fried rice. Me and the person I was with were so impressed we ordered again for dinner/left overs as we ate our lunch #DontJudgeMe lol

It was dangerous because at the time I lived a short distance from this location, which I still visit when I happen to be on that side of town because for some reason it just tastes a little better from the original hole in the wall location. Maybe it's just a little more love put into it. While the Chandler one is still good.. just something about the original. 

Over all PHX or Chandler.. I"m a fan!The buffets in Vegas are greatly over rated and have started to get pricey to the point that a fine dining meal is often a better choice.  The Bellagio Buffet is probably the most consistently excellent food for buffet style dining.  They have an excellent selection of high quality ingredients that few places can match.  The flavor and cooking isn't always where it should be but that is the trade off challenge with buffet dining.  The biggest negative is that the legend of this place precedes it so there are often long lines to enter this gastronomic experience.  I would certainly recommend you experience dinner here at least once in your life and you might make a habit of it on your subsequent Vegas visits.I cant say much other than purw amazement! This place had EVERYTHING and the best part is it all tasted as if I made it at home and thats saying a lot since i'm a classically trained chef! Much love to all the kitchen workers here... They do a GREAT job! Our server was awesome tooOMG the best buffet food I've ever had.  They have all types of food.  Mexican, asian, middle eastern, southern, italian...you name it they probably have it.  Kind of pricey but worth the money if your really hungry.Definitely my favorite Vegas buffet.  It's much higher quality food than standard buffet fare, and the wait staff and chefs do a fantastic job.  Quality early lunch spot to fill your belly full of things to soak up all the alcohol you plan to consume the rest of the day.Great food, great prices, great atmosphere, great service!  What more can you say?  Packed with locals and tourists, I could tell this would be a great dinner and I wasn't disappointed.  Try the burger with an egg and onion straws.  Delicious!!!I moved from Madison a couple of years ago but I'm telling you, every now and then I get a huge craving for cheese curds and The Old Fashioned has hands down the best fried curds known to man. When/if I win the lottery, I'll be sure to fly to Madison on a regular basis just so I can have these curds.

I love this spot because it reminds me of everything that I loved about living in Madison. The midwest charm, good beer and other drinks, and the food!  I am surprised I didn't leave Madison by crane after the weight I gained.  Everytime I go back to Madison, I always make an effort to get at least one meal there.  

I usually vary up my menu items every time I go which is rare. The fish fry is excellent but a bit overcrowded and that is a little distracting. I guess when you have it so good, you have to expect it get as busy as it does.

TL;DR Before I die, serve me a plate of fried cheese curds from The Old Fashioned.This is an awesome club!  If you have a group (we had 7 guys for a birthday party weekend) get a table and bottle service.  Tao's VIP service team is the best in the city.  We got a table up at the Tao Beach pool area with access to the regular club as well.  Our two waitresses were total sweethearts and everybody in the group had a ball.  Things got pretty blurry as the night wore on, but that will happen when you order 4 bottles of Goose (that's Geese)......One of the nicest suites I have ever stayed at. This was my second time coming here and enjoyed everything this awesome hotel has to offer. Nice pool, spa, beds and comfort .  I will be coming back soon that's for sure.When in a rush and just wnat good food at a cheap (for Vegas) price, this is the place. It is behind the Casino in the Paris and has many different crepe options. Whether in the mood for sweet or savory, this place has you covered.

I got the savory crepe with prosciutto and it was delicious. The prosciutto was salty, but htat's the way I like it. It was ready in about 10 minutes and we were back at the tables within 25 minutes of ordering.

There is a cafeteria style area to eat right next door and is a good area for people watching.Looked for tickets online and the best prices I found were on the Bellagio "O" website under the 25% discount seats. I didn't get them because we weren't absolutely sure our friend was coming so we got last minute tickets.

Been living in Vegas for a year and had a friend visit from Chicago and this is our first show as "locals". Have seen "Love" and "Jersey Boys" before we moved here. "O" was great, we had seats in the back row, but was actually good because we got to see the whole stage and with so much going on, it was a good viewing point. Section 304 front row on the balcony would be awesome seats. 

The show was really good and entertaining.  We'd see it again if other friends or family want to see a it. Cirque always has some comedy features thrown in and the comedy in this one was pretty funny. The divers had splashes like Olympic divers. There was hardly any splash. The acrobatics were incredible.

A must see show for visitors or locals. As locals, we made a pact to see at least 1 show a month. Vegas has some of the best entertainment and after raising our kids it was one of our Pro's for moving here.so far..this is one of my favs..it's a water theme..and it was my first show..

the best show ever..i think i might of sat a bit too close..so if you want, sit a few rows back..maybe like M or even P..center of course..

it's very blueish..and the performance just stunning..you can tell most were asians..lol..chinese in particular..what can i say..we work hard!

i def recommend this as the last show to see..bc no other show will be comparable to this one..

word of advise on price..get them wen its on sale on travelzoo or wen they have promos on certain dates..This show was amazing.  Their use of sets is astounding.  These people are so creative.  They use everything to its fullest.  The lights, actors, set everything.One of the better Cirque du Solei's.     The technology distracts from the story at times.My husband and I had one of the best dining experiences here, we ate in the upstairs dining room and service was above and beyond. Food was even better, presentations are unique and seem small at first, but packs so much flavor we were more than satisfied at the end of the meal. Loved the unique creme brule with fruit on the bottom so creative, and also appreciated all the chef's little extras through out the meal. We also actually got to see the owner Rick Moonen which was so cool.If you are planning an event, I cannot recommend the excellent staff and service at GVR enough.  The resort was the first my husband and I looked at when we began planning our wedding, and after one meeting with the event staff, we stopped looking.  The grand staircase and patio overlooking the pool was the picture perfect place for our ceremony and reception.  

The event/catering staff, especially Kara, was so helpful, flexible and accommodating.  They offered suggestions when we were overwhelmed and stepped back and let us make our party our way when we needed to.  They really treated us like honored guests even though our wedding was small and didn't pull out all the stops.

We chose to have a cocktail hour with appetizer service instead of a formal dinner, and once we had decided on appetizers we were interested in, the event staff at GVR invited us to a private tasting to finalize our selections and try their cakes.  They really pulled out all the stops to please us.  I expected to try a few things in the events office, but when we got to the convention space of the resort, we saw our names with "Tasting for the Wedding in Honor of..." on the digital signs advertising the day's events.  We were led to a room with a beautiful table set up, white gloved servers and all.  A chef personally described each dish to us, some that we had selected and others they thought we might like based on our selections.  They really went above and beyond both my husband's and my expectations for help and service.  They also shared several sample cakes with us that day.  I was worried about having to have my cake done in-house, but I shouldn't have been.  Their pastry chefs are professional as can be.  All I had to do was email the event coordinator a picture of a cake I liked and there it was, like magic, on my wedding day.

The servers and bartender during our wedding were phenomenal as well.  The servers kept appetizers on everyone's plates with a friendly smile.  The bartender created a signature cocktail for the day that everyone loved and had champagne ready for the toasts.  

We had some problems sorting out room reservations and group rates with the hotel, but the event/catering staff, especially Kara, gave us excellent and professional service from start to finish.  They really treated us like valued guests which can be a rarity in Las Vegas.I ate here last night and order a burger and it was so good they put thousand island on it and bacon oh my it was delish and they also sell cheesecake from the cheesecake factory that was the icing of the cake I would re moment everyone go try itSpaghetti Carbonara to die for. Desserts wonderful. Busy, bustling, a little loud but wonderful old-school cafe. Don't let long line deter you, they get you seated promptly.this is a great place to stop by and have a brew. they keep several microbrews on tap to choose from. they have a little area up front where you can sit at the bar or one of a couple tables. they also host free beer and wine tastings and events, check their website for what's on tap and events. people we have met inside are friendly, laid back. staff are great as well. they have a huge selection of wine.This is probably the best nightclub in Vegas.  The music, the waterfall, and everyone there is just awesome.  Went here with a large group of friends and this place was bumpin!  Make sure that you have equal amount of girls as guys, as Girls will get in for free and Guys will pay whatever they are charging (as every place in Vegas will do).  The music was awesome, the waterfall was classy, the drinks were flowing, and if your not having a good time here then you don't belong here.QUESADILLAS VIANA=Large Flour Tortilla filled with tender sliced chicken, diced asparagus, melted cheeses and diced green onions served aside sour cream and pico di gallo.  Need I say more than the description???My favorite Mexican Food here!  Love the smokey flavors!  Great food, great service, wonderful bar, clean all the way.  The ambiance is unquestionably great.Visited Okada at the Wynn Resort and had a fantastic time. Robata Grill - Sushi Bar - Teppan Tables. Great food and service. Perfect portion sizes. Service was top notch, friendly and very professional. The Toro Sashimi sampler was over the top, each ones of the Robata items perfectly grilled and the Okonomiyaki delicious. Also, great dessert selection, which is very interesting for a Japanese Restaurant. A must go!Fez is probably my favorite restaurant in the Valley. Every experience I have had there was a great one.
The food is amazing, every time I come back there I had forgotten just how amazing the food is and then when I take the first bite it is pure bliss. The menu has such a good selection, I always have trouble deciding what I want. One day when I'm rich I will head over to FEZ and buy one of everything. The desserts are delicious, at first I would always get the cheesecake with nutella, but eventually tried creme brulee and mousse which where just as amazing.
I couldn't ask for better service, either. They always pay attention to our table, and everyone there is so genuine and friendly.
The atmosphere is really cool. Everything from the patio to the bathrooms, I remember thinking how cool the sink was the first time I went to FEZ.
FEZ is without a doubt a great place to go, any day.Awesome food, fast service, friendly waitstaff, great atmosphere... What more could you ask for!!!Good pizza! Bubbly crust with good flavor, fresh toppings!What can I say?  I love Grimaldi's, and this is my 2nd favorite location in metro Phx, just behind the Chandler location.  The coal-fired, ultra-high-heat cooking method produces a pizza that's great in ways that are hard to describe, you just have to experience it firsthand.  Believe the hype - especially when it's coming from Brak - this is the real deal.Amazing!  If you are local and haven't noticed, many properties like MGM have spring/summer tasting menus that are perfect for a nice night out.  They range depending on the restaurant of course, but they are amazing deal for a nice 3-4 course menu.  One of our fav meals so far still, and we've been here 6 years.Now THIS is my kinda place!!!  We loved it so much we were back twice within the 3 days we spent in Vegas.  The food is delicious and the entertainment at night is awesome as well.  I had the wings the first night we were there and my boyfriend had a cheeseburger, two foods that sounds extremely ordinary but were so much more than that!  We had a great time there and I just know we'll be going back every time we visit!I love love love the Dane County Farmer's Market! I'm going to miss it so much once I go back to London... where the majority of them are pretentious and only sell "specialties." I'll settle for a classically awesome Farmer's Market any day!

I love buying my produce directly from the farmers! Knowing that your money goes directly to them is great. There are also stalls selling baked goods, cheese, honey, mushrooms, plants, and even gourds. 

I've been enough times to know where all my favorite things are! When all my shopping is done, I love to settle down on a picnic blanket, have some lunch, and just people watch. 

P.S. Go around 12-1 for the best last minute deals! Lots of the pastry places start selling their goods 2-for-1!My favorite outdoor market yet! Beautiful produce, beautiful crafts, and I even loved the slow meandering human traffic that naturally formed around the square. Of course, being there on a day with perfect weather makes everything seem that much more wonderful.This buffet is such a good deal although I don't remember the actual price! I go whenever I stay at the Wynn because the selection and quality are top notch. This is easily the best buffet in Las Vegas, hands down. Great desserts, carving stations, food stays warm, good service, beautiful setting... SUCH a good deal!!Still youda youda best! Best I ever had. I have yet to meet a Buffet as good as here. Still the same delicious king crab legs and rare prime rib with kick ass horseradish! The only problem is the price, it keeps going up and up dinner for 2 $92! But I have a generous hubby so we ate to our hearts content! I also loved all the new dessert items, the tapioca with mango mousse, to die for. I also loved the cinnamon pumpkin cake, wowza. I forever love this place. Happy New Year!
P.S.  Didn't care for the ice tea, tropical flavor, I'm a plain girl!!This is my favorite lunch place in all of Vegas (I havet o admit that I absolutely adore Asian food) and it's located in my favorite hotel in Vegas, too. I'd recommend everyone give it a try - I don't think you'll be upset.

SERVICE: My service hasn't been anything terrible or stellar in previous visits. My most recent visit had GREAT service - a nice Southern girl who took several pictures of our table, gave us drink and food recommendations and didn't rush us at all. The hostess agreed to let us have this great "bird cage" table/room even though there were only five of us - so nice!

FOOD: This place is like an upscale P.F. Chang's with a larger menu. Our table ordered the panang noodles, the pad thai (with chicken instead of shrimp) and the Kung Pao chicken. Everyone at themselves silly because although the portions are HUGE, the food was so good and no one wanted to leave a noodle behind.

DRINKS: Two of our diners had a mojito and LOVED them - they even had bamboo sticks in them. Really cute. I turned the mocktail lemonade into a cocktail with gin and liked that pretty well, too. Great drink menu for a lunch stop.

ATMOSPHERE: I like the color scheme in this restaurant and have never been disappointed with the table we've been given. One thing I would admit: the other diners in my group did not find the chairs very comfortable.

OVERALL: This is seriously my favorite lunch place in Vegas - a must-stop while we're there. Don't worry about meals long after - you'll be full for the next five hours.Jazz brunch is it!!!!! Food just simply perfect.Wow what a quiet hidden gem in the middle of a loud casino. Food, service, outdoor patio all A++ amazing place for lunch on the patio overlooking golf course and waterfall.OMG if your in Vegas and want all you can eat go to Rio's Carnival Buffet all you can eat. The biggest, best buffet of all time. Just went on Friday Feb. 15th for lunch buffet. We got discount tickets from the discounters on the main strip then drove to Rio. Only was 13.00 each and got there before the dinner time buffet at 4pm, dinner time starts at 5pm. The best crab legs ever! If you want seafood go here instead of the main Seafood Buffet, this one has just as much seafood and even more better choices to choose from. You wont be disappointed at all.My boyfriend and I went a little too far yesterday. After a very late night, we decided to treat ourselves to brunch. We started off the only way you can: with a pitcher of sangria. That thing was large. Ridiculously large for two people. I swear, we each had four or five glasses and still hadn't reached the bottom. It was an endless supply. 

Which leads me to this: ordering brunch buzzed is always a bad idea. I am not responsible for the amount of food ordered after drinking.

After my third glass of sangria, I ended up getting the brunch special, which was some kind of baked egg, pulled pork hash with homemade tortillas. That wasn't enough for me, though. Oh, no. I also had to get myself an $8 side of mac and cheese. My boyfriend got the prime rib and tried to finagle himself another mac & cheese, but luckily the waitress talked him out of it ... we don't need to die of a heart attack before noon. 

When the food came it was like a little smorgasbord of heaven. Words were not spoken, only cooing and mmmm sounds for rest of the meal. When I finally paused to take a look around, the damage had been done. I ate myself sick. It was one of those: milk was a bad choice moments. It was hot and I had just eaten a ridiculous amount of melted cheese. By this time, I was sinking low in my seat while the boyfriend encouraged me to help him finish off that damn pitcher. I just couldn't do it. I gave up. Threw in the towel. The meal had won and I felt like that guy on Man vs. Food. I actually had to get a to-go box despite all the eating I'd done. 

When I got home, I took a three hour nap. 

That was some good eatin'.From a gori 
This restaurant changed my mind about Indian food.  I'd tried Indian twice before and hated it.  My bf (who is from Mumbai) persuaded me to give his nationality's dishes one more shot.  
Most people go to Indian buffets (a cheaper and pretty good option) but I went initially to a normal meal.  I loved it!  The butter chicken melted in my mouth and I was ravenous after the chutneys.  
I'm converted.  I love Indian food now thanks to Tamba.  
note:  Although technically on the Strip, it is isolated from the crowds and meets a steady stream of repeat customers.Amazing food and a cool atmosphere!We love Rosies!  For their Fish and Chips I am a addict, washed down with extremely fresh Guinness, total food buzz!   
If you don't like it Pogue Mahone!Extraordinary.For some reason, I walk into this place, drop more coin than my miserly ass usually likes to, and I have a good time and leave with a good buzz.

I'm low key and usually not wearing clothing costing more than $50 (total from head to toe!) and haven't been hassled here.

Maybe they just know who I really am - wait then I'd probably get da boot.amazing hotel. i enjoyed staying at a non-smoking and off the strip hotel. The hotel was worth more than $99, which i paid for 1 night. The room came with a $25 dining credit (good towards steak restaurant, cafe or room service) which i used for breakfast the next day and on the way out. The room was clean and modern. The bathroom fixtures were modern, had a mini fridge, blow dryer, iron board, coffee machine, a shower and a separate tub. The bed was firm with lots of fluffy pillows. I like the color scheme, it was vibrant and young. The hotel was super quiet and the staff was friendly. Check in literally took 5 minutes and check out was literally 1 minute. I don't recommend the valet. Yes, the valet is free but by the time you wait for a valet, get your luggage out and wait for a bell-hop, you could have already been in your room relaxing. Skip the valet, self-park (plenty of parking), walk to the elevator, check-in, total 10 minutes. The valet service can be hectic with impatient travelers (i was sandwiched between a honking mess, front car was honking and the car behind me was honking because the front car didn't understand the "self-Park" line..(the front car) turned off their car while waiting for a valet attendant and made a complete mess, valet attendant fixed the situation, 5 minute of chaos- bleh )

I used the $25 dining credit at the e.go cafe. Ordered smoked salmon bagel with onions and capers, and a cup of chai tea. Delicious!!! There were 4 people in my party and the $25 stretched for 2 smoked salmon bagels, 1 ham breakfast sandwich, and 2 coffee. 

I would definitely stay here again. Quiet, smoke-free, modern, clean, attentive staff, monorail within walking distance (literally 2 minute walk), and no riff-raff.PERFECT.

This was one of the most enjoyable meals I have ever had.  The table layout in the restaurant is delightful, the restaurant has a very cool vibe, the service was phenomenal, the menu was loaded with incredible choices, and the food is absolutely perfectly balanced and executed.  

We ordered the seafood risotto and the gnocchi.  Both were the best we had ever eaten.  The server and the overall service was perfect...literally, nothing you could find wrong.

Fiamma is the kind of restaurant where you remember the flavors of the food for life and you will have a meal memory--remembering exactly how the restaurant felt, who you were with, the server, etc...BEFORE GOING IN TO A BAR READ THE NAME!

It's a Dive... I know clever name! 

It smells.

The bands are loud. 

You might see a fight.

The clientele is not what you take home to your parents.

The music being played is not on the top 40.

It's a DIVE BAR, and does that title all that is needed.Great Happy Hour!  Went for late happy hour and was treated to good food, good beer and great prices.  They also had live music for an added bonus.  The only disappointment in the food department was the rib tips.  They were a bit dry and not a great deal for the price.  Other than that, everything else was good.  

The atmosphere was another pleasant surprise.  The decor makes you feel as if you were in the South, without the bugs and humidity.A barbecue joint my girlfriend wants to go back to?!?  Can this possibly be true?!?  Apparently so!  She loved their sauce so much, she bought a bottle to go.  The sampler was superb.  Where else can you get barbecue, fried okra, fried green tomatoes, and fried pickles (pickles are not my thing, but I tried one anyway, ALMOST edible) on one platter?  The brisket was tender, moist, and delicious.  Cheese and jalapeño grits? Check.  Peanut slaw was uniquely tasty.  The only glitches were (1) a few minutes delay between delivery of meals one and two and meal three (both meals were brisket but with different sides, so ... I dunno) and (2) I am PRETTY sure one of our "brisket" meals was actually tri-tip, but it still tasted great and we shared, so it was no big deal. 

We will ABSOLUTELY be going back.  I can  go out to eat and have barbecue with my girlfriend!  YAY!I will second Ellen's review under mine... and I am not biased!  Brian and Kara (the owners) are great - they have both done a ton of events and have great experience with triathlons.  They have limited selection but all high end triathlon products and really cute apparel too!

Triple Sports offers clinics for beginners and wetsuit rentals for those of you not ready to take the plunge and buy your own.  I always buy my running shoes at Triple Sports and I have not been let down yet.  Great goggles, swim caps, sports nutrition products, and even yoga products to complement your tri training!

Check out their website and sign up for their newsletter - it will keep you up to date on events coming soon at the store and in our tri friendly city!Forget the fireman.
Forget the cop.
Forget the business man.

All I want all night every night is the MILK MAN!! 

No joke... the milk man was HOT! And it wasn't the bangin' body I was digging, it was his smile (*wink, wink*).

I've been to a few male reviews in Vegas and I'd have to say this one is my favorite so far. The guys are super cute and pretty personal! Plus they're all really from down under and have the cute accent! 

Highlights for me included:
* The bar with really stiff drinks and drink specials! 
* The milk man
* The Birthday Girl (my friend) going up on stage
* The milk man
* The group pictures where we made them do asian poses! 
and of course
* The milk man!GREAT SERVICE, GREAT PRICE, GREAT SETTING
========================================
The service is superb (what else would you expect from the Four Season?). We were sat promptly on the verandah overlooking the garden and pool. The chairs and tables were comfortable. The staff were excellent, helpful, prompt and proactive. The food was great. The brunch buffet was amazing (they even hand make mini donuts to order). The fresh juices tasty and refreshing. 

Verandah has the kind of "can and will do service" that you'll be highly satisfied with. Also, you won't even feel like you're in Las Vegas the minute you enter the property yet it's right next door to the Mandalay Bay Hotel.We had dinner at the verandah and I think I have found my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas. I had the pre fix which was $39 for 3 courses. The asparagus hand made pasta with Ed sauce and Italian sausage was incredible. Just writing about it makes me want more. My friend had the osso buck and swore it was the best he has ever had. Before we left we were already planning our next trip back.This is my second favorite place to get brunch in Las Vegas, and favorite on the south side of the Strip.  On the north and overall, I still prefer Tableau at the Wynn but this is very close.Places like this is when I appreciate my iphone and the yelp app the most.

Was in Vegas and wanted some breakfast that doesn't come with the word "Buffet" attached to it. Looked up on Yelp and found this little gem.

It's around a 10minute drive from the Strip, without traffic of course.

I ordered the Crazy Chicken omelet with the muffin. They leave the whole carafe of coffee on your table, saving yourself from waving down a waiter(ess) every time you want a refill.

The omelet itself was very tasty, the muffin, while not as heavenly as some others claim, was indeed very moist and tasty and worth a try. The potato that came was what made my day. The fried squared shaped potato was crispy on the outside, but still mushy on the inside! Such a delight!

If I find myself in Vegas some other day, I'll definitely come back again!

Try to be here before 9am on the weekend, the waiting list was long by the time we arrived at 10am on the Saturday we visited.This place is as good as it gets. The best breakfast place in town! Since my first review the water issue has changed. I can find no wrong with this place. I love Egg & I.Liliana provided excellent service for our breakfast visit. My wife had the classic breakfast and said the bacon was very good. I had a special, the Hobo Scramble, which was exactly what the description said and really hit the spot. Their potatoes are deliciously seasoned. We both also had their tasty sourdough toast. Had already had coffee so can't speak to that but the iced tea was good. It was Memorial Day so there was a pretty good line but it moved quickly, only about a 15 minute wait. Hostesses were great, too!Over the years Phoenix has been fairly inconsistent in having good eateries.  Unlike major cities like Los Angeles, Chicago and New York, Phoenix has always been dominated by corporate eateries and little or no ma-pa eateries.  

In Chicago they call them joints...just great family owned neighborhood restaurants that do everything par excellence and that's precisely what we have here at Eden's Grill.  The owners are ridiculously proud and upon your first visit you will find out why.  Soups, salads, incredible beef, chicken, lamb entrees', Reasonably priced, extraordinary food, that's what this place is all about!Oh holy yumminess! I am so stuffed from eating that GIANT Gyro that came in my lunch special with the delicious greek salad!  I had literally been craving a gyro all day, seriously a random craving(not pregnant), and so I did a quick Google search, read some reviews & decided alright let's try it!  Seriously for $7.95 I think I just ripped them off for how much food came with it.  The tzatziki was PERFECT and refreshing, the pita was warm & soft and the meat was seasoned and cooked to perfection.  

I can't rave enough about this place & I've only tried it once!  CAN NOT wait to go back!

Oh and should I also mention their "A" rating from 3/18/13 posted in front, that always makes me feel warm & tingly inside knowing how well they take care of their restaurant(I've been through those state inspections!)A bunch of friends and I tried this place for my husband's birthday the other day after I found it here on Yelp.  For the love of everything tasty, this place was the BEST barbeque place I have ever been to (aside from a place I loved that went out of business in San Diego).  After reading all the reviews about the appetizers and entrees, I pretty much already knew what I wanted to order before even sitting down at our table.  

Our waiter, Lorenzo, couldn't have been better with his service and sense of humor.  The feel of the interior was a mix of casual and modern yet not too overly countryfied...there weren't dead animals hanging on the walls staring at me as I ate or hides either.

The group of us ordered the Onion Block for our appetizer.  I am not an onion person, but am a fan of the Bloomin' Onion at Outback.  But I can tell you right here and now that the Onion Block at BobbyQ's was A-M-A-Z-I-N-G-L-Y delicious!  It had the perfect crispy consistency, but what made it was the BBQ ketchup that it comes with.  I could have ate the sauce by itself.  The 6 of us ravaged it.  

For our entree, my husband and I went for one of the winning combinations, particularly the BBQ chicken and prime rib.  We decided on the ranch beans and the Mac & Cheese (after the reviews) for our sides.  I went to ask for an order of corn bread (3 for $1.50) but Lorenzo told me that he would bring us a basket for all of us.  So, I am not sure if that is something that is included, kind of like chips and salsa at Mexican food joints.  

The chicken was absolutely juicy and had the perfect amount of sauce and the prime rib was also juicy and melted in my mouth (we ordered it cooked Medium).  First, the Mac & Cheese was so very creamy and tasty that I had to stop myself from eating that and get back to the meat.  But the ranch beans tasted like so many others I have tasted, not bad though.  My friends and I, who also ordered the M&C, noticed a hint of jalapeno (not spicy, just the taste).  We asked Lorenzo and he told us they have two types of melted cheese in the kitchen, one being the cheese they usually use for the M&C and then this pepper jack/jalapeno cheese they use for other dishes.  He had said they must have accidentally used the wrong one and that it hadn't been the first time it happened.  This was so not a problem, b/c that jalapeno taste was actually what made it, I think.  I'll have to request it next time.  

The desserts didn't impress me much, but I knew from the reviews, we'd be getting free donuts before we left.  I loved that touch!  Mark my words, we will be going back more than once.  I'm sure we will take our in-laws and my family to give them the chance to taste BobbyQ's deliciousness!!!!!Awesome food!! My one and only spot for BBQ!! I am basically addicted! Our waitress Chelsea was awesome! Very curious  and charming! Ask for her when you come!If you're looking for the best cupcake you've ever had, it's going to be from here. I think everyone gets caught up in the hype with other places(Sprinkles Cupcakes), but they have nothing on The Cupcakery. The red velvet is by far the best cupcake I've ever had, but the grasshopper and the bugsy come in close second. A lot of reviews say the cake is dry, but I've never had that experience before. Overall this is my favorite cupcake shop and I highly recommend you give it a shotAll that I can say is get the trash can lid full of food you get all your favorites plus corn fries and slaw.  The Brisket here is awesome!  The ribs are very good! Not as big as shanes BBQ but still good.  The smell alone is enough to make you hungry!  The service is pretty good, drinks are overpriced but that seems to be the new standard nowadays.  The Portion size is huge.  You will be taking some home.  My favorite is the RIb Tips.  You get three times more rib meat and half the price of a rack.  You will not be disappointed.  This place is not for calorie watchers.   The sauces are awesome too.LGO is THE BEST pizza place in town... wait, in the country... wait, in the world!!! It is as good, if not better than Pizzeria Bianco too (minus the 4 hr wait). The sourdough crust is what makes the pizza, as do the high quality topics. My fave are avocado pizza with prosciutto, the mushroom one, and the gladiator (with sausage). Their breakfast, sandwich, and salad menus are excellent as well! It's fun to hang out in the "grocery" store next door where you can get good cheese, wine, bread, and little kitschy things. Their white sangria is the BOMB! And you can't beat the $6 bloodys and mimosas on the weekends. With the family-friendly laid back atmosphere and fun for all, this is a true Phoenix gem.We dined at Sensi on Saturday night and had a FANTASTIC time and an even more divine meal.
As is my habit, I usually ask the kitchen to send out what they recommend- what I got were these miracle medallions of perfect seabass on a bed of what think was shredded daikon- but I can't be sure, not that it mattered because it was a miracle.
The crispy shrimp appetizer was also super yummy and yes.... on the salted caramel ice cream.
Sensi is a not to be missed experience in Las Vegas.
Thanks again Chef Martin!AMAZING. It is tradition for me to visit this fantastic restaurant each time I visit Las Vegas. The kobe beef burgers are FLAWLESS, as is the yellowtail sashimi. The desert platters are UNBELIEVABLE. I honestly have no complaints.very good .. loved the presentation the ambiance and the food.. I would highly recommend the Lychee martiniVery good dim sum & prices are not bad for vegas.  I will come back each time i visit for sure.  I'm still craving this place when i got back to California & i tried a couple of dim sum places & they're not even comparable.  I may have to fly back to get my fix!So far my favorite pizza bistro! Love the music, the whole wheat pizza crust and the service. The main problem is that it gets really crowded Friday night. That's why I suggest to stop by any other day of the week and even try to make reservations if you are a group. I always sneak to the bar and enjoy the meal. 
Ingredients are really good in taste. I have tried also their salads and I'm waiting to try their pasta or other offers...but, any time we go, we end up always ordering a delicious pizza!Great food, fantastic menu, fun atmosphere, excellent service, and the best Arizona faire in the state. I always take my family and friends from out of state to eat here. Even take business partners here. Lunch menu is perfect. 

We all know where the original "pizookie" came from! BJ's can't touch it!My daughter and I just found out about this amazing bookstore yesterday, when we went there to buy tickets for a Sherman Alexie event.

The minute I walked through the door, I thought to myself, "OMG! This is the first time I haven't felt like an alien since moving to Phoenix." My daughter, literally, had to drag me out of the store. I could have stayed there for hours (honestly, days).

However, despite urging us out the store, as we were leaving, my daughter said to me, "Mom, this place feels like Portland. I've not felt this good since we moved to Phoenix." 

Not only does Changing Hands have a wonderful energy and an amazing staff, but  a co-worker tells me that they sponsor all kinds of book-related events, such as the Sherman Alexie talk, throughout the year, and apparently, have a Frida Kahlo "convention" each year. 

I wish I'd known about this place a long time ago. But, now that I know, I have a second home.Definitely one of the best seafood buffets I've been to! Pricey, as are most of the buffets in Vegas, but worth it! They have this shrimp and lobster tail medley which always has a line. 

We signed up for this text message service that texts us a couple times a week to get deals on things in Vegas. We ended up saving 10$ off each person at this buffet. 

Definitely look for coupons before going. Would definitely recommend this place if you're a lover of seafood.Love the assortment of women's boots! Just bought my first pair of old gringo boots! I'm in love! Oh they were on sale too!!!Like the rest of you, I was inspired to go to this show for the complex plot and character development... Instead, I was shocked to find a Vegas show with gorgeous showgirls singing and prancing around on the stage.

Against all common sense, I stayed and watched the show. The segments are very entertaining. Lorena, the singer, is multi-talented. Sean E. Cooper provides some entertainment but probably stayed longer than he should.

The showgirls... ah, the showgirls. In a city where attractive women are all over the place, these stand out. They're gorgeous, talented, and absolutely mesmerizing. The name of this show may be the most accurate description of any show in Vegas.I had my Baby with me when I went, so I didn't have too much time to explore. What I saw made me happy, happy, happy! Looking forward to going back! Already recommend this place to friends who share my love of retro style!

....... Oh and the girl who was working the day I went it was REALLY NICE! Makes it so much more enjoyable when the staff is personable and helpful!!!!! Very welcoming!Simple, Neopolitan-style pizza cooked to order in their brick oven. The crust is excellent, thin and soft.

They have an espresso machine, and if you like cappucino be sure to order one after you eat. It was one of the best i've ever had.I've gone back here several times but most recently with my husband.  Their wine selection is stellar.  The portions are generous enough to have leftovers for lunch the next day.A. Maze. Ing.

I am a MVF regular, and somehow I missed this episode.  I found this gem with my fabulous Yelp app.  We love to hit up a delicious place on the drive back to Phoenix and the Hash House did not disappoint.

Before we pulled up, I was expecting to see a hole-in-the-wall type of dive-y place (with a name like "hash house" that is what I pictured),  man was I off!  Nice prominent outside and an inside atmosphere that feels modern/industrial and yet cozy/family environment at the same time.  

The walk from the door to the hostess stand was a little icy . . . the two girls didn't smile at all, however they did quickly seat us, which was nice.  Our server was great, I forget her name (sorry). She explained that they don't use microwaves or heat lamps; as soon as your food is ready, you get it.  Very cool! She had a nice positive energy, like someone who enjoyed her job.  

Like all of the other reviews say, the food is phenomenal!  And the portions are HUGE!!!  Some of the most unique and creative menu items, yet all sound like the most delicious dish ever.  My BF got the fried chicken with mashed potatoes, eggs, and bacon.  I am not a huge fan of fried chicken, but this might have turned me.  Melt in your mouth, moist chicken and a perfect, well-seasoned, light, crispy breading. Yum!

And my breakfast was one of my favorite breakfasts of all time.  A vegetable hash with artichokes, mushrooms, spinach, sun-dried tomatoes . . . you know all the good stuff . . . not the silly filler veggies of normal breakfast places.  Served with potatoes and two eggs (over-medium) so I can spread the runny yolk all over my vegetable goodness.  My mouth is drooling just thinking about you.  Your's will too . . . just check out my pics of this stuff!

Oh, and how could I forget the homemade biscuits and homemade jam ("strawberry today" the server told us).  Again, I've never been a huge biscuit fan, but these were by far the best I've ever had.  Huge, softball size, light, flaky, buttery.  And that jam . . . oh, my goodness, I HAVE to go back!!

I almost shed a tear when I couldn't take home my leftovers, there was no where to stash them for the 5 hour drive home.  Whaw, whaw, whaaaaawn.

Next time . . . I will not wait until the last morning of my trip to go back!  As a matter of fact, we may just have to hit Hash House a Go Go on the way into Vegas next time!!Food was as good as it gets! We ate at the bar bc we came in during Sunday brunch.  Food came at a decent time and they even refilled our drinks after we wer done eating. This is as good as it gets with large tasty portions and efficient service!Lunch is a LOT cheaper than dinner.  I always love the view.  I've been here 4 times and it's a must go place for lunch every time I go to Vegas.  You can get 25% off entrees with a tix4tonight coupon.  You also get a free ride up to the top which, by itself, costs $16 to go to the top per person.  Service is always top notch as well as the food.  Lunch is very casual (shorts and a t-shirt are fine), dinner is dressy.Exceptional!!! Beautiful views of Las Vegas not necessarily the strip though 
The staff is courteous and helpful
It's very romantic and a crazy view of the city 
I got the soup and froi gras - which were both excellent
I would definitely recommend for a classy and romantic date in VegasDon't let the line fool you, it goes quick!  

The first time I went I was a little daunted by how ordering actually works but once we found out how it was simple.  The food was really good.  Not extremely filling, but filling enough.  I got the sampler dish and everything was good. As said before, the root beer cannot be better.  It is a very unique restaurant with great food.I have been eating at this place for years, and I have never been more impressed with Phoenicia than I have been in these past two weeks. 

The place is impeccably clean. 

The service is fantastic, in fact, Hakim proved to me today that good service is something the Phoenicia is striving for. 

The desserts are Ambrosial (see pictures). 

The gyros sandwich I had today had perfectly spiced meat, served steaming hot in a pita. One of the best fast food options out there! 

The slice of pizza had onions, garlic, peppers and herbs on it, and the crust is so thin and flavorful. I would rather eat this pizza than most pizza offered in the ares (i.e. Slices). 

The food offerings are not overly large, but I usually have enough to take some to go for later, and I never leave this place without getting a small dessert to go because they are that good. 

I also buy many of my spices here for cooking at home. Their spices are fresh and affordable. Even if you don't cook Mediterranean style food, the add any of the mixed spices like the Persian 7 spice or the Schwarma spice to your chicken or vegetables, and you will be regarded as one who can make a meal by your guests. 

Finally, if you use extra virgin olive oil at home (as you should because it is the best cooking fat that comes from a plant in the world) this is the place to buy it. Large containers are for sale at $9.99. You will save 20 - 30% by getting your olive oil here versus the grocery store (or Whole Foods if you are a yuppie. But if you are a yuppie, and spending outrageous amounts of moula on olive oil fills some void in your empty soul, please continue).I'm used to the old fashioned ice cream parlors, not the baskin robbins type place that u get it to go, so being still pretty new in town one day I decided I was on a mission to find a good banana spilt with all the fixings...after I googled best ice cream and Lappert's came up I figured I would give it a go. So I drive about 20 mins out of my way, park and was expecting a long line. To my surprise NO ONE was there. I ordered my banana split...and you can get as many toppings as you want for the same price ($5.50) and choose anyyy flavors of ice cream. Got served fast and the ice cream and split were delicious. I will definitely drive out of my way for this again, and again. If I lived closer, I would be in trouble. 

The negative? I COULD see this place having long lines time to time so I guess that was just luck. Also, its a pain to park in the casino and have to walk thru it to get there, ahhh the temptation of gambling. But nothing that wouldn't stop me from being back.Worth every penny.  As an animal lover, I couldn't believe how close we were able to get to the white tigers and white lions.  I had first seen the lions as cubs in the Siegfried and Roy show - and now there they were, all grown up.  Beautiful.  Snow white fur with big blue eyes.  Amazing.   

The dolphins are always a joy to watch as well.  They love attention and really put on an impromptu show for the passersby at the underground windows.  Schools often do educational tours of this exhibit.

I feel good that the money spent getting in is used towards the preservation of these animals.  I've always admired the efforts Siegfried and Roy have shown for these rare animals, and if I can contribute in even this small part - it just feels right.This place is sick! we got a 1300 2 bedroom condo for a few hundred dollars! The only downside to this is that it's not attached to the MGM hotel itself.  The upside.... you have a full kitchen and a few bathrooms which makes it super easy to get ready to hit the clubs! I'd definately come back here again!Super super clean, chic hotel, with a deli and Starbucks near the lobby. There is no casino downstairs, but the walkway to the MGM casino is not too far.

We booked a junior suite with a queen bed and a pullout sofa. Perfect for 4 people!

There was also a kitchenette with a stove, blender, toaster, refrigerator, and cabinets full of glass cups. The refrigerator was pretty roomy and came in handy for all the water bottles and alcohol we brought.

The bathroom had a double sink, jacuzzi, and separate shower. The toilet had its own door, so that someone can handle business while another showers and gets ready. However, every time our boyfriends used the toilet for that reason, they locked both doors, so nobody could access the shower or sink! Pointless haha, but that's just a guy thing I guess.

The jacuzzi is SO relaxing after walking all day. I fell asleep for almost half an hour and didn't want to get out! One side had two jets that hit your lower back perfectly. Heaven.

It was a little difficult to contact room service. It took maybe 4 phone calls until they picked up, but once they answered, they came shortly with our requested towels and extra water bottles free of charge (+tip of course)! Come to think about it, they gave us free water while we were waiting for our valet, too. I guess they want to assure their hotels guests are hydrated!I have been going here for a couple years and I love the gyros and the shwarma(spelling?) is really good. The owners do a great job with all their food. Enjoy!!!I LOVE Touch of Thai! I eat here any chance I get & I've never been disappointed with their vegetarian dishes. I haven't tried a lot of their veggie selection, but as for now my absolute favorite is #69 - Tofu Curry. Mmm mmm! I am also a huge fan of their Pad Thai and their Thai Iced Tea. Great stuff!** This is on my "MUST-GO" list whenever I am in Vegas! **

PROS:
- Best Pan Roast in Las Vegas!

CONS:
- Long Lines during peak dining hours

MY EXPERIENCE:
If you have read my earlier review on The Buffet at Bellagio, you might have noticed that I stated that it's been a while since I been to an AYCE location in Las Vegas.  And the OYSTER BAR located at PALACE STATION is the reason why I don't go to buffets anymore.  For the same amount of money, I can get something I love and cannot describe myself.  You have to try it out yourself.  My favorite chef at the Oyster Bar is BOB.

Remember... The Oyster Bar only have approximately 16 spots at its counter.  Don't go to the Broiler (the restaurant next to it) because it doesn't serve the same quality of food at the Broiler.  If you go during peak hours, expect to wait in line for 30-60 minutes.

There are plenty of different dishes available at the Oyster Bar, but I always order the following everytime I visit:
- 1 dozen of raw Oyster
- Combo Pan Roast #7  (shrimp, crab meat, and lobster)
- Bloody Mary Oyster Shooters

I have tried their House Gumbo before but think it was a little too salty for me.  The Combo Roast is a tomato based sauce that is sweeter and more to my liking.  

OVERALL:
I would literally drive to Vegas just to eat this.  I love their Combo Roast!  If I can eat anything as my last meal on earth- This is definitely it!Living and visiting Las Vegas I try to stop by The Oyster Bar at Palace Station Casino to get some of that delicious Pan Roast or Seafood Gumbo. I try to explain to people what the food is like and until you actually go and taste it you really can't get the goodness in words.

Here is a photo from last time I was there: http://www.flickr.com/photos/jeremyandrews/4826303270/in/set-72157624570150854/

This place is often imitated in Las Vegas, and I have tried some of the imitators and they can't get the flavor and experience down right. The Oyster Bar is not a high-end looking place or a restaurant per se, more of a cut out in the wall right off the casino. I like that it is in Palace Station, because if it was in a high traffic casino on the strip the line would be way too long. Plus, it is good to enjoy the old school casinos and take a break from the fake, and expensive ones on the strip (may just be me from living there so long).

If you go around lunch or dinner expect a wait because there is only like 20 seats which are high chairs around the Oyster Bar. You sit right next to other people, which is good for striking up conversation and talking about the good food you are eating. The cooks prepare everything right in front of you which is fun to watch and gets your appetite going.

My favorite thing to order is the Combo Lobster and Oyster Pan Roast which is served in a sweet and spicy tomato bisque sauce. I usually substitute the scoop of rice that is served with it and get linguine pasta instead. The highlight is the sauce and how they cook it in those steam pots, so if Lobster and Oysters are not your thing, add something else like shrimp or something, whatever you get, the tomato bisque will be GOOD! My second favorite dish there is the Seafood Gumbo which is served with a scoop of white rice, so many good flavors and tastes going on.

These are good sized portions so be prepared for a doggy bag. On the other hand, if you came to eat, enjoy some appetizers like Oysters on the shell (be sure to view a few before ordering, it's Vegas after all, and note the season you are in), shrimp cocktails, and I usually go for the Caesar Salad (nothing special, but tasty). There is also deserts available. Soft Drinks, Draft & Bottled Beer, and Wine too.

I seriously dream about this food from the Oyster Bar when I am not in Las Vegas, enjoy!

Oh, and they will ask you if you want 1-5 spicy for heat, instead I suggest getting a little heat like 1 or 2 and later just add hot sauce to taste which are available on the bar in front of you. Nothing like having a big bowl of great food but not a good idea to get 5 stars of heat and unbearable to eat.This is another place we always go to at least once every time we are in Vegas.

The sourdough rolls are always warm and go well with butter. The thing to get here is the Pan Roast. They must put crack in it or something, it is addictive.

There are only a few generic wines to choose from, but wine is really not necessary when you can drink the Pan Roast instead. 

There are only a limited number of seats to sit at, so sometimes you have to wait a while, but it is worth it, and the service is good because there are only a limited number of seats to sit at.Been back a few times. 

The BF and I decided to go and try something different and got some Bouillabase. It was pretty solid with a good broth. Plenty generous on the seafood including lobster, shrimp, crab legs, cod, clams and mussels. 

Yes, yes, pan roast is bomb, but sometimes I have other moods. I think we will come back and try more items. We kinda figured out some of the "slow" times where the wait is 30minutes to no line so when there's no wait it's really worth it. 

We've had Steve and Ricardo a ton of times at night and both are nice and offer great service. 

If you're a fan of bloody mary's, theirs is pretty decent. They do a special for $3.50 from 1am-9am so if you need some Hair of the Dog recovery stop on by for some breakfast pan roast and bloody marys!Wow! Combo pan roast, Level 8 was SPICY but so GOOOD. Don't be scared of the chef, he wears a hat that says, LOVE LOCALS, cuz he hates tourists. He snaps at you but its just a facade , he's actually a really nice man who pretends like he dont take shit from customers!I never would have ventured to Palace station, let alone Oyster bar had my school not set me up to stay the weekend here for a school/work thing. But my fate was in good hands. Our first night at Palace station we wandered the hotel to see what goodies it had to offer. I noticed the small, but crowded Oyster bar and the corresponding line. Checked it out on Yelp, and decided I would have a meal here before the weekend was over. 

On my last day, the bf and I had the pleasure of dining here. We shared a combo pan roast and had a half dozen oysters. Oysters were shucked in front of our very eyes and were delicious, fresh, and succulent. There is a decent wait for the pan roast which explains the constant line here. Each order is individually cooked (or should I say roasted) in this contraption thingy. I don't have a better explanation for what that thing is so you'll just have to come and see it for yourself! It is a very entertaining process to watch. The pan roast had a mix of seafood and has a tomato-bisque-like taste, but think more creamy, more melt-in-your-mouth goodness. One bowl was more than enough for sharing. Although I may have been seen licking my bowl at the end, and that's only because I couldn't get enough. 

Our waitress was delightful and pretty comical. She suggested an extra scoop of rice since we were sharing the pan roast, an excellent suggestion on her part. I'll have to remember to come here again the next time I'm in Vegas since it is a bit off the beaten path. I really just wanted to use that phrase. Well really this is a good 10-15 minutes west of the strip, definitely a cab ride or short drive away from an excellent meal!If you are looking for 5 star service, ask for "Eric" who also tends bar.  While all the staff do good service, Eric is the best of the bunch.    It you can, it's worth waiting for a table served by "Eric".

Also, the best value is the Tri-Tip roast.  For the price ($15) you get a great value with lots of meat and veggies.  You can get a small "Micro" salad on the side.

Want to save a few $$$ on an appetizer?  Grab some free popcorn from the Bar's popcorn machine.  Get a basket or two at no cost and it's a great starter.  If they are out of popcorn, tell "TY" the manger and he should make you a fresh batch.

So remember kits, Eric is your best server choice.  Get some free popcorn and hit up the Tri-Tip roast for a great value.Just had Sunday Brunch here. I actually enjoy it this time around. My first time here was back in 2004 and it was better than, but this trip I had brunch there and the food is amazing. I had a great time. It is probably because I was with my family, but either way the food is amazing when it is Sunday Brunch. I highly recommend this buffet over Paris Buffet. I still like Paris Buffet but this is nicer.Wait!  You haven't checked out the happy hour here?  Stop reading and do so and afterwards continue reading.  From 5-7, small plates and wine are only $6 which given the quality of the food and wine is a damn good value.  Throw in the patio on a nice summer night and this maybe my new go to spot for after work refreshments.Holy sh*t!   *#!@!!*#???  F**K !!!! Sorry, I'm not prone to using profanity, but that's how upset I am that today was my first visit to Stinkweeds.  I have wasted countless hours surfing iTunes listening to 20 second clips of music, when I simply needed to walk into Stinkweeds and say, "Hi, tell me about some cool music."  I am completely outsourcing my music shopping to the staff of this store.  Let me tell you about my first time.  I walked in the door. I am sure I looked disoriented.  I had not been inside a true record store in years.  The fact that the shelves were filled with an overwhelmingly large number of albums with unrecognizable band names amplified my disorientation.  A member of the staff approached me. "Do you need help?"  I hesitated, thinking to myself, I am so not cool,  I am about to be exposed.  I must have nodded in the affirmative because he quickly followed up with  "What kind of music do you like?"  This is the most perilous question to be asked by a record store guy. Visions of High Fidelity flashing through my mind, I mumbled, "Uh, I don't know."   "Yes, you do.  Tell me."  I managed to rattle off the names of a few non-mainstream bands that I actually really love.  I waited for a respond.  "Cool.  Let me play you something."  He proceeded to switch the music being played in the store to his pick for me.  Within minutes I was sold.  We repeated this process until I had selected 3 absolutely amazing albums that I would have never found on my own.  After wandering around the store for a while on my own, admiring the wide selection of stellar music, I decided it was time to pay and get on with my day.  Record store guy paused a moment before ringing up my purchase.  "Wait a second, I think we have used copies of all 3 of these albums. I'm going to save you some money."  Sure enough, after some searching, he returned with the promised goods.  Total price for 3 amazingly good albums?  $24 including tax.  I'm hooked.  Awesome music selection, friendly non-threatening staff (yes, I know that's redundant), lots of used CDs...  you know where to find me next weekend.everything here is awesome.. and the decor is amazing.

it's like anthropologie's lil sister, but locally owned.I dream about Garbage Salads........
There may be nothing more sublime than sitting down to a dinner under the purple aura that permeates even the bubbles in my glass of champagne. There are ENDLESS wonderful things on the menu however before deciding what to narrow down the choice to, one must take in the brilliant atmosphere. Order ANYTHING on the menu, it will be good. My favorites include, the rock shrimp, the garbage salad, the bolognese pasta, the mac and cheese, the gnocchi, never mind the yummy steaks!!! 
Order to your hearts content from one of many fabulous waiters, however you must, absolutely have to save room for dessert. 
Order the smores...I won't give anything else away  like the ending to the biggest movie of the year....
Enough said, go to N9ne, go often, eat a lot, and think about the next time you make a reservation always...Well done Michael Morton....Once we entered into the building,. the cocoa cola bear was on the right side, ready to greet and pose for the camera.  The camera man was so nice that he offered to take a photo with my own personal digital camera,.. YAY THUMBS UP!

My friends and I took the escalator upstairs and already planned on doing the cocoa cola tasting,.. $7 (SEVEN DOLLARS) to taste 16 different types of cola,.. THUMBS UP AGAIN!

The three of us just ordered one set to taste and we had alot left over,.. if you don't mind sharing germs and being the last one sipping the cup,. you can share it with at least 4-6 people =)

My favorite cola was the smart watermelon &smart apple.  They both happen to be from China!!! 

I can't recall, but one of the cola tasted horrible,. when I say HORRIBLE,. I mean BARFFFF,.. it was like taking a shot of vodka, but the flavor still stays on your tongue until you gurgle the next cola,.. I believe the nasty vodka tasting cola is Tray2 #7 Beverly from Italy?!,...

SCOREEEEEEEE,.. because I had an awesome time =) If you haven't had the chance to do the tasting!! DO SO NOWWWI do not miss Vegas, but I definitely miss Archi's. 

I used to go to Archi's about once a month with the ex, and we would order Thai iced teas, either the red or yellow curry tofu and the basil tofu, each at level 7-9...mind erasingly good. Unlike most Thai places, when you ask for spicy they give it to you on the Thai scale rather than the 'yeah right, whitey' scale, which I've come to recognize as a mark of respect. The service was always terrible and the place is tiny, but the heavenly food makes up for these mortal flaws.

I know this constitutes blasphemy, but in terms of vegetarian Thai food I think Archi's holds its own against Lotus of Siam.Easily the Best Restaurant in the Vegas valley.Chef Wes Kendrick really knows his stuff!!!Note, this pizza is real Neapolitan style pizza. So you are getting a pizza that is not loaded with a ton of ingredients, rather fewer toppings and more simple, traditional, sauce and dough. 

The service is fast, food always good, and staff very friendly. The pizzas are cooking in a wood fire oven that gets over 900 degrees F. Takes approximately one minute to cook giving the pizza's a thin crispy on the outside chewy on the inside crust. Most of the ingredients are imported from Italy, and the cook moved from Italy to help the owner start the location, which was originally of horizon and valley view. 

If you like your pizzas with so much cheese and the sauce loaded with so many seasonings that it doesn't even taste like tomatoes then this is not the place for you. If you like authentic simple recipes and high quality ingredients, for an all in all reasonable price, then you will enjoy this restaurant.I went in a group on a Friday night once and it was still pretty decent. Lunch is slow on weekdays and the alcohol menu is full of options. I keep coming back for the Green Turkey sandwich. The staff rushed us once, but other than that they're all nice and quick to provide refills and answer questions about the beers. I keep coming back for more and highly recommend others to do so as well.Top ten reasons you are doing your foodie loving self a disservice by not eating at Hanks when you are in Las Vegas:

1) BEST. DIRTY. MARTINI. EVER. . . EVER

2) The place suggests sex and intimacy- but not in a Las Vegas Hooker way.  It is beautiful, it is stunning, it is classy and it makes me wish I went with a significant other and canoodled in the booth in the back

3) The creamed corn is out of this world, I will salivate about it at random times throughout the day when I have a flashback about its awesomeness...and I usually hate creamed corn

4) The scallops are amazing.  Nothing more needs to be said

5) The hostess/host pulls the table out from the booth if you are seated at one.  Now that, my friends, makes me feel like less of an awkward fool trying to shuffle in and more like an elegant lady sitting down to a fine meal!

6) The filet mignon is the most succulent, juicy, flavorful piece of meat that I have had in a long, long time

7) The atmosphere is inviting.  So many times you go to a restaurant and you feel as if you are just another person waiting to eat before they shove you out the door.  Not at Hanks.  At Hanks they invite you to cozy on up to the fire (that has a fish tank in it) and stay awhile, maybe even put your feet up

8) The steamed Alaskan king crab legs are the biggest things I have ever seen.  They literally hang off the plate.  They are served ready to eat and the butter is heated in your very own flame heated mini bowl so you don't have to share...mmmmmmm

9) The service was impeccable.  They never lingered too long but they were always there when needed and added some great insight into the menu and the incredible wine selection

10) The chopped salad is something that I could eat every day, it is just that good!

A little side note: I was in Vegas with locals that have lived there for more then 25 years...they had two favorite places to eat, one was a sushi place by their house, the other Hanks, which they declared the best steakhouse in the city.  I would agree with them.Walking in we notice the live music, great singer. The interiors were beautiful large chandeliers, fireplace, walls of wine.  Really romantic setting for me. We chose a bottle of Duckhorn Merlot really enjoyed it.  To my surprise the Canadian oysters were delicious!  He ordered surf and turf and I had the bone in ribeye. Ribeye is my favorite cut because of the marbling. I actually liked the flavor of the filet a lot better and texture was perfect.  The lobster was perfect and served with candle melted butter. Service from aerating the wine to never empty glasses, as soon as we ate the last bite of each course the plates were cleared and the next arrived. This dinner made it as one of my favorite dates!GIPSY is THE original Las Vegas Gay Dance Club. (And actually the first gay club I ever went to. Ahhh, 21.)

The GIPSY is pretty cool and still rocks it every night of the week.  Drag contests, theme nights and a nice little $10 Liquor Bust on Sunday night. ( Ohhh, Liquor Busts.  Ahhh, 21.)

GIPSY sports a nice sunken dance floor in the middle of the club.  I've always been a fan of dance floors that are surrounded by people watchers, it's like an arena, and we're all waiting for the ultimate dance off.

Also, the great thing about GIPSY the crowd tends to be pretty mixed cuz most people, gay or straight, know about the GIPSY.  A great place to take your girlfriends or your boyfriends......GIPSY always has a nice high party energy.  And if you get there before 11pm, there's usually no cover.  But, come after and it's upwards of $15 to $20.  I know, that's just glam robbery!Recently went to Strip Steak on a quick weekend getaway and already wanting to go back! As some have noted below, we printed the Restaurant.com $50 dollar gift certificate and had no problems using it. I had made a reservation a couple weeks before on their online site, but when we arrived at 7:30 on a Saturday, they seemed to have plenty of tables available. 

Got our complimentary duck fries and they were D-E-E-E-licious. Our waiter Glen ran through the list of daily specials, but we already knew exactly what we wanted (I always come prepared.. haha). I got the 10oz filet with the mac and cheese and my fiancé got the Kansas City Strip with the scalloped potatoes. I was surprised by how fast we got our food (although like I said.. the restaurant was maybe 3/4 full). The mac and cheese seemed to be plentiful (although it was so delicious I wanted to eat it all by myself!) but the scalloped potatoes (IMO) wouldn't have been enough for just the two of us to split, so I'm glad we got two sides. My medium rare filet was so good that I was getting depressed eating that last piece. Service was excellent, always filling our drinks and coming by to ask if we needed anything else. Used our coupon and had no problems with that. Didn't have any room for dessert, although I think we would have had we not filled up on Fat Tuesday drinks beforehand! The place was a little noisy, so if you're looking for a quiet dinner, this is probably not the place for you. We were looking for delicious food to fill up on and not a conversation. :P Overall, a wonderful experience and dinner and I will absolutely make it a stop on my next trip to Vegas!60 rounds through an MK-46.  All I can say is... I hope it was as good for it as it was for me.Truly an amazing place!!!

I am from out of town and held my wedding reception there. from the very beginning patrick was so helpful in helping me coordinate the whole affair. he was attentive and easy to work with. 

the food itself was great!.... my guests couldn't stop talking about the Mayan chicken tamale and the guacamole. we had the rock shrimp chile relleno, blue corn chicken enchiladas and the beef fajitas. it was great!

lastly, almost everyone of my guests commented on their amazing service. they couldn't believe how nice and accommodating the staff was..

overall, i would go here again and you should too!This place is an absolute gem.  An explanation of the food just doesnt do this place justice.  I am currently on my 10th different pasty (Just tried the Pilgrim) and I haven't been disappointed in one yet.  

There is a great vegetarian menu as well.  I haven't ventured into this area of the menu yet, but all of those choices look just as delicious.  

Every time I try a different pasty, it becomes my new favorite.  I'm sure you will feel the same way.

Dont pass up the $3 Irish Car Bombs!  Its so good when it hits your lips.It is a big hot pocket!  At least that is how I tried to describe it to my friend before we went tonight. 

My friend and I went there tonight for a to go order, to take to our new favorite brewery.  There is no to go order area so we just sat at the bar seating. It took a few minutes for us to decide and just as long for us to be asked what we wanted. 

It was one of the rare occasions where deciding was hard, there is an entire vegetarian section of their menu. I went the Veggie Mexican, complete with spicy soy, eggs, cheese and potatoes.

 Once you hold a pasty in your hand you can feel the heft and how it will be a filling me. Each bite was full of spicy and savory flavors. The potatoes added a nice texture contrast to the soft eggs and soy. 

My friend had the bangers and mash, which he thoroughly enjoyed.

We did have a side of garlic chips (fries) they were neither needed nor great. 

Parking right in front can be tight but there is parking in the rear and easy access to the back door.A little pricey but definitely worth it! Everything is really fresh & their "designer" rolls are all tasty (what I've had so far).  The first time we went for lunch & it was just the 3 of us. The staff was really friendly & fun - they even encouraged us to "bomb" our saki bombers!  The place is very clean, even the bathrooms.  We've officially added this to our list of lunch spots to frequent!-Truely a 5 star event
-this place is known as one of the top clubs in Vegas, so glad I got to check it out
-Got a sweet deal, $15 admission with a discounted thing I found online.  Entrance to Playboy Club and Ghostbar as well.
-DJ Jazzy Jeff happened to be there that night spinning. It was cool to see him.
-The VIEW is spectacular, I mean seriously- It is.  You are on the 52nd floor of the Palms and get the best view of Las Vegas.
-Lots of hot ladies here, out and about.  Some were regular hot girls, some were drunk whores and some were prostitutes.  Hopefully most guys can tell, lol.
-Didn't get table service but the drinks were good. Vodka Soda was on point.  Saw some people balling it out, getting bottles of Grey Goose and red bull. They did look like they were having the time of their life on the roof.
-Loved, loved this place.  The music was great.  Jazzy Jeff was playing alot of current stuff, also mixed in some nice R. Kelly songs.  It was awesome.
-Loved the layout of the club too, sort of shiny, Moon-esque and silvery inside. It looked great.
-I will definitely come back next time I am in Las Vegas.

Normal admission on weekdays is $20, on FRIDAY and SATURDAY nights it is $40.

Views from Moon outside that I took with the camera.I will never buy another brand of jeans after finding Lucky about 2 yrs ago. Ive talked friends that would never dare spend that much on a pair of jeans into becoming true addicts like me. (some joke that i should be their spokes person) Their tshirts are a bit expensive for my taste, but as soon as you put them on you can see why. their the softest most puuuurfect fitting tshirts Ive found (even talked mom, the clearance rack queen into buying some). The most important thing that keeps me back is the service...I go to the fashion show A LOT. Lucky is the only store that always greats me with a 'honest' friendly hello.. a few of the guy remember me and have learned my taste so they're very quick to show me the new stuff that they just know ill love..and i will..cause I'm such a sucker in that store. ;)The Griffin is my favorite bar to visit when I am in Las Vegas.

The atmosphere is great, the drinks are great and it's reasonably priced.
It's definitely a very different vibe than everything in that area.
The music they play is hipsterish and so is the crowd.
The decor is kind of medieval looking but in a very tasteful way.

I will continue to go to the Griffin every chance I get.Great tourist attraction. feature shops, botquies, night clubs, art museums, Good Luck with finding a place to park. I highly recommend valet.

There is so much history in Old Town. You can find historical museums or take a ride on the trolley. My favorites are all the options to dine at after taking a stroll through all the shops. 

Farmers Market on Saturday's with local vendors. That is another great perk about old down many local shops and boutiques with a variety of things to enjoy.The BEST place to find any gift for any person. Baby? Hand-stitched onesie. Grandma? Candle or temp tattoos. Boyfriend? Book or shirt.
Unexpected gifts, this shop is full of surprises. I really enjoy the small, meaningful collection of books they carry, as well as the selection of handmade jewelry.Best breakfast I have ever had!!!!   Everything was from scratch...unheard of anymore...but so incredibly good!!!  Always good, but best when Bill is cooking.

The portions are huge and the prices are low. 

Eclectic patrons. Diner definitely has no frills, but the food is incredible!

Closes by 1pm everyday so make it there early.

The inside is a bit run-down and cramped, but the food is the best you will find anywhere!  It is always busy so cleaning is done quickly...so you may find a utensil that the washing machine missed a spot...just let the waitress know and she will quickly apologize and replace it with fresh silverware.    

I whole-heartedly recommend this place for breakfast (only eaten breakfast here).  My husband and I actually have cravings for the food here....sooooo good!!!

Cash ONLY!This is the best locals casino in Vegas.  I love it.  I don't gamble, but I frequent their many other offerings.  Their bowling alley is the best in town.  More expensive, but better.  Their movie theaters are really great.  Plus, so many great restaurants.  Their buffet is the best off-strip buffet in town.  I always find parking.  It is located right off the 215 so it is easily accessible for many people.  The architecture and decoration is comparable to the top casinos on the strip.  All the fun and beauty without the hassle of traversing the strip.This is definitely one of my favorite places! I go there all the time & I'm never disappointed. Great service, great food & great drinks! 4-8 happy hour is the best.. it's 2 for 1! Their sangria is my favorite, as well as every margarita I've tried and the other drinks like the pina colada and lava flow. I love the chicken nachos, their chicken tacos & their enchiladas. One of my friends always gets the taquitos but I haven't tried them yet.. though it's obvious he loves them. I personally love the decor.. it's really laid back and there's always a nice mix of people. Check it out!Hash House (not to be confused with Hash House A Go Go) is simply incredible. This is my kind of place. I tried the chicken and waffles with grits and entered breakfast heaven. For added appeal, the large selection of homemade jams (I tried the watermelon) will keep me coming back for more.I love this block I love this bar. The whole experience has me wanting to move to Phoenix. The galleries on this residential block had us initially confused as to which was the bar. Once we got in, we were treated to some awesome live jazz and a cool vibe which made me feel like I was in Portland.Loved it Loved it Loved it!!!!!  While it was pricey at a little over 200 hundred for two people and only lasted about 15 minutes, it was worth every penny, and I'd do it again in a heart beat.  My husband and I did the city lights tour and it was amazing.  So beautiful.  Our pilot was really cool and funny as well.  I think he could tell I was nervous.  I don't normally like to fly (in airplanes that is) or heights in general, but he put us all at ease and the flight was smooth and steady.  As long as all flights are like the one we took, I think I've officially feel in love with flying in helicopters.Great Happy Hour Menu!  Half Price on ALL drinks until 7, not just select drinks.  Mojitos are a MUST!  Never had Cuban food before, but loved it.  Authentic atmosphere and food and the waitstaff was friendly, will definitely go back!  Also, they have a great band on Saturday nights and Dj of Fridays, great nightlife atmosphere without having to go to the Las Vegas Strip!!!We really enjoyed the food service and the waiter!!! Really an enjoyable experience and for sure we will be back!!Go.  Go early.  Go often.  Try lots.  Start with the carrot cake sandwich.  Or a macaroon.  Or get a big box of assorted baked perfection.  So good.  So effing good.Best coffee in the city.  For a fresh take, have them add a shot of coconut syrup to your joe.  The French macaroons, the strawberry croissants, and the current scones are to die for.  Cookies are good fare but not "the bomb."  Also, the vegetable bread lacked some taste.  Stick with the ciabatta with goat cheese on top.  Ham and cheese sandwiches are pricy but yummy.  Staff always is professional anc courteous.Vanilla Macaron, I LOVE YOU. 

Always order a whole box of these when I come here.. they are simply delicious. 

Besides macarons, I usually don't order anything else... 

However, I did order the red velvet cupcake once and it was DELICIOUS. There was even cream cheese filling INSIDE the cupcake.. GENIUS! 


A little hard to find because It's not directly facing the casino, but if you ask enough people.. they'll eventually lead you to the right place. Oh, it's also right outside the Tao Beach exit!I love their macaroons! So far the pumpkin is my favorite. I also like the caramel and coffee flavor too.Anytime I can find a Yoshinoya I am there!! I am kind of a proponent for this place.. I don't know exactly why i love it so much, but I seek them out when I can find them. We don't have them in AZ, so I usually go out of my way when I am out of state to find one. You have to get the chicken and beef combo bowl. So good.. I am hungry for it right now!I can't say anything bad about this place. The service is excellent and they're all so friendly. You can see that they all help each other out. Location is in a nice neighborhood (just outside of Aliante). The restaurant is modern and clean. The food is fresh and delicious.What can I say that hasn't been said about In-N-Out.... It is AWESOMELY DELICIOUS!!! I like this location by UNLV better than the one off of Flamingo & Dean Martin Drive. That location is for the tourist who didn't rent a car or didn't check google maps for other locations. I like to order my burgers here animal style which is their special sauce that resembles thousand island dressing with cooked onions. If you get a chance to go to an In-N-Out burger, get onto the internet to see the special menu.love love love the spa!!I would much rather shop here than WalMart. This place is clean and the employees are very polite. They have a wonderful coffee shop and the best fresh soup and the large is only $3.99!!Finally a Japanese owned sushi bar beside Sakana in Ahwatukee!  I guess Sushi Ken has been here for a while, but I didn't realize what a great find it was.  

My wife and I went there to splurge on Japanese sushi since they are better than the typical Korean owned sushi places which are most common in the Phoenix area.  

We found we didn't splurge at all as we do at Sakana or Hiro.  We didn't break $30, which surprised me.  5 stars for value and great sushi!

Domo Arigato!Best chicken fingers in town! Rock n roll themed; records on the wall, rock n roll music playing, games like checkers battleship on the tables to play.Ever been to Italy and wish you could bring the real gelato home with you? That's Amore did just that. They literally brought the gelato bar from the old country and filled it with the most delicious, authentic, and interesting gelato treats imaginable.Probably one of the funniest shows we've seen in Vegas. Bought the tickets through Groupon and saved considerably on the price. The show was a little slow to start as he got the volunteers under hypnosis but once the show started we couldn't stop laughing. I would definitely recommend going.Been here 4 times and the food is just great.  Today I had the pizza and it was the best I've ever had. Have not had an avg or bad meal here.  Far better food then most restaurants in town.The best food and drink in Mesa, period.Consistently great coffee. That is what you need to know.
Depending on location, quality food: breakfast, lunch and dinner: sandwiches, salads, paninis, scones, cookies, etc.  
Wifi to stay all day, hang out, and atmosphere at all locations is always interesting.
My favorite might still be on Hwy. PD.
Staff is always polite.
I will never turn down a chance to go to Barriques.Had an incredible meal here, but may have been because we did the pasta tasting menu. The atmosphere is cool, relaxed and kind of chic, but the casino is in sight so that can ruin it. The 7 course pasta tasting menu was amazing. Very different pastas, very different sauces, and the desserts were great (beware-the final one--budino I believe--is very hot.). The cheek ravioli was absolutely amazing. My only complaint was that the balsamic brown sauce tastes a lot like balsamic, maybe a little overpowering, however the final taste you taste is the smooth meat inside. This could be a very pricey meal, but definitely well worth it.This park has it all aquatic facility, baseball diamonds, soccer fields,  basketball courts, dog parks, and picnic areas!I remember when this location housed a Pizza Heaven. Thank god they're gone so that people that make a consistently great product could move in and take over the world!

Okay maybe they won't take over the world but they sure could try with what are seriously some of the greatest cupcakes I've ever had.

Chocolate cupcake is just amazing.

Vanilla cupcake is great too.

I had another flavor that was awesome as well but I can't remember what flavor it was for some reason (I've had a couple of beers).

Rosewater cupcake that they used on cupcake wars was good though I wasn't a huge fan of it. I really don't think I'd make a cupcake that tasted good made with rosewater.

Irish coffee cupcake was a bit disappointing in terms of how high I regard this place but was good for what it was if that makes sense.

I haven't actually tasted their cookies but the wife digs them. I also dig their sometimes funny messages posted on their chalkboard out front. Service is friendly and they box their cupcakes well so as to make sure they arrive safely at their final destination.

I love you maker of great cupcakes, keep up the good work!I don't have much of an update. This is more of an UPGRADE of my original rating. After visiting Mr Tofu a handful of times now, I can confidently say that this place is as good as it gets. The Sundubu is to die for and it's all I bother to order. I've had combination, seafood, and beef - all medium in spiciness. I have yet to have even a mediocre experience here. Their banchan is probably the best in town. It changes all the time and there is always at least one item that wows me. The guy that works there is always quick and courteous. Even if we don't split the bill, it's never a hassle to pay separately.

The only way a meal at Mr Tofu could get any better is if the sexy sax man were to randomly appear and serenade us over our bowls of tasty Sundubu.

p.s. How could you not love a place that uses the Robotron font for its name? Mr Tofu 2084!I've lived here three years in 3 different units but now I own and I can't say I've ever enjoyed living any other place in life better than I love living here!This is a beautiful park has fishing volleyball courts with real sand ,skateboard park, basebal,l basketball, batting cages, it's playgrounds, Walking trails, biking trails, it's a really nice park just to spend the day at a nice barbecue pits. It would be a great day for barbecue now days with this weather so beautiful  check it out with your family and friends and have a BBQ.I never have a bad experience at Bj's.  I love everything about it from the layout all the way down to the Pizookie!  The microbrews are great.  I really like how they suggest certain foods with the different beers they offer.

The pizza's are great.  I have never been to Chicago, but it's nice to be able to get a deep dish only a few miles from where I live.  The pizza's may not look gigantic but don't let that fool you they are feeling.  The staff are awesome the place is always clean and there is always A nice buzz in the place.  There hasn't been a single time that when someone suggests Bj's I say no.  The place is great.Dined here over the weekend 3 times and I LOVE THIS PLACE!!! Blue cheese burger awesome!!! Dry aged bone in ribeye awesome!!!! pretty cheap too for a dry aged ribeye. Service was fast polite and and knowledgable. The front of the restaurant feels like a sports bar with so many plasma tv`s and when they sat me in the back it felt like a steakhouse...pretty cool!!!Authentic Mexican home-style cooking. Everything was tasty and cheap. Nice family-run business and friendly. I had soup and my bf had enchiladas. A real local joint. We want to go to Phoenix just to have the food again.I love the Scilian Pizza its full of flavor, the spicy spagetti is fantastic.  The owners are Italian and have a thick accent, the place is definatly casual and I have no problem going in with some bball shorts and a tshirt unlike most italian places.  the service is always friendly and fast...definatly a must eat at establishment when your looking for some great italian food but low key.I don't usually go to this Fry's, but I was running late one morning and stopped in here to get a quick breakfast and coffee from the little Starbucks kiosk by the deli. This Starbucks was better then some of the main stores I have been to. It was very clean and the girl working there was very friendly and made my drink perfectly!Phoenix Dermatology is awesome.  The entire clinic is run very well.  The receptionists are always very friendly and personable, and they always make sure things are running correctly and taking care of any business with insurance.   They are also super friendly on the phone when calling with questions or scheduling appointments. Wait time in the office is also short.

Dr. Darren West is also a great doctor - he's super friendly and spends a fair amount of time with you to make sure you know exactly what your treatment entails.  I never felt like I was being rushed so he could see another patient.  

And when it's time to leave, the front desk has all the paperwork ready for you!Best sushi in Gilbert. The PHX roll is my favorite. Nana and Harry always provide great sushi at great prices. Its a nice place that isn't loud and pretentious like other chain sushi places....

And their dumplings are to die for.This is a excellent place.  I just went last night for Happy hour.  The happy hour menu was excellent.  The place must be a hidden gem very few patrons.   I think people are missing out best sushi place ever!  Excellent service and I will be returning!  Try the Pink lady, Tootsie roll, Ultimate CA roll and Las Vegas roll.  If you like dessert try the mouchi ice cream.The breakfast club sandwich here was great and then to top it off their house shake with chocolate, peanut butter, and espresso was addictive!You can't get any better than Fair Trade in my book. And here's why:

I work for a grassroots non profit organization. This will be important later in the story. 

I first discovered Fair Trade through one of the owners, who also happens to volunteer for the organization I work for. (Remember I said my job would be important to the story?) I came in a few times and was continually impressed with the friendly staff, great coffee, and overall great atmosphere. 

Because of my job (and lack of office space) I have a LOT of coffee meetings. Sometimes it's all I ever do. And FTC is a great location, and it's way cooler than Starbucks. So my coworkers and I definitely give them a ton of business with our meetings! 

The Sunday brunch is awesome, everyone must try the egg puff and the potatoes, they are to die for. It's a great way to spend a Sunday morning!

The free WiFi is also awesome when I need a Central location to work. Sometimes I refer to it as my office. 

Lastly, Fair Trade donated coffee to the annual fundraising event that our organization holds annually. It's just a wonderful testament to how community oriented the staff and owners are, and how great Fair Trade is for downtown Phoenix!Always great service.

If they ever go public I will buy their stock.  They train their people well, hire hard working people, and move faster than any place I've seen to get your work done fast and done right the first time!

I get my flats fixed here even if I don't have their tires. They charge, but the amount charged gets credited for when you buy tires there. I always buy replacement tires here and refer all people to Discount Tire.Dr. Tonya Horner is Awesome!!! Love this place and the ease of scheduling, getting records, billing and most of all the care received! Highly recommend Dr. Horner.30 July 2013

Great customer service by the CSR (terminal 4 North) on the graveyard/swing shift! Courteous, kept us updated, and offered refreshing ice cold water! A necessity during 100 degree. Thanks v much! Xx

Price for RT service was less expensive than a taxi one-way.The Northeast is bereft of good Mexican food, much to the dismay of Little Brother and I, who reside in Boston and New York respectively and have nicknamed each other "Salsa." So when Little Brother and I took a  trip to Arizona in February, we vowed to eat Mexican food at least once a day, every day of our five day stay in the Sunshine State.

One day we were in the car, looking for a place to eat when we saw a sign for Pancho's Mexican Buffet.  Little Brother and I were smitten instantly and demanded to stop there ASAP.  Apparently we were the only ones in our family who had such amorous feelings for Pancho's.  We begrudgingly ate somewhere else but the next day Little Brother and I borrowed the rental car from our mom and headed to Pancho's for lunch, accompanied by our cousin who shared our good taste.

When we got inside I paid less than $25 for three people to eat at the all you can eat buffet.  And that includes drinks.  I felt smug.  Only at Pancho's could this public interest lawyer treat two people to a sitdown meal without having to mentally recalculate how much her net worth had gone down as a result of the expenditure.

Our eyes were bugging out at all the choices.  Four different kinds of enchiladas, refried beans, rice, burritos, chips and salsa, fajitas, ice cream, sopapillas, among many other food items.    

Pancho's combines the gluttony and endless choices of the all you can buffet with the hospitality of a sit down restaurant.  You fill up your plate at the buffet and sit down to eat.  If you need seconds (or in my case, thirds) you raise a miniature Mexican flag at your table, signalling to the server that you need something.  You then tell the server what you want from the buffet and they'll bring it back for you. I'm suspicious of this setup; Pancho's website makes it sounds like the server is there to enhance patrons' experience but I feel like this is a tactic to curtail the amount of food that people eat.  In the time it took the server to bring me a second plate of enchiladas, I could have already been working on a third of taquitos, had I been able to make a return trip to the buffet on my own. The same thing goes for the fact that you don't help yourself to the food at the buffet but are served by Pancho's employees who stand behind the counter.  But I digress; don't want to give the impression that poor Jeanne didn't get enough to eat.  We enjoyed our lunch at Pancho's so much that the next night, we casually suggested Pancho's once again for a family dinner, hoping the rest of our family had forgotten that Pancho's had been vehemently vetoed a day earlie. Unfortunately our family members weren't dumb enough for that. 

When I got back to New York I immediately when to Pancho's website, eager to see if there was a Pancho's nearby.  Too bad for me and Little Brother; Pancho's restaurants are located only in Arizona, New Mexico, Arizona and Louisiana.  On days when I feel overwhelmed at work and disillusioned with the criminal justice system,  I dream about a second career as the proud owner of a Pancho's restaurant.  If I can't bring justice to my clients, maybe I can bring Pancho's to the Northeast.Great mani/pedi spot! I have been hooked to their shellac and they do an amazing job. I don't live close to them anymore but they are worth the drive. Shawn and all the staff is lovely!The toilets were not flushing properly at our rental house.  Dennis answered the phone himself, at 9pm.  He came the next day and fixed the problem.  We were very happy with both his professionalism with our renters and with the price.  There are not a lot of plumbers out there that answer their own phone, come when they say they will and get the job done right the first time.  He certainly gets my vote.This sets the standard for all Gyros for me. Everywhere else has to try to at least be close to George's. All fail. I can't speak to the entire menu because I can't get past the gyro and side salad. The fries look great and they do have pasta on the menu. 

The gyro's are the perfect blend of everything and delicious. I highly recommend them. It is a local joint and although they have tried to "up" the ambiance, it really doesn't matter. It is what it is. They are closed on Sundays.I love the new look. I love the new covered parking. I hate though how the downsized their inventory. Yes, there is tons to buy, but with particular brands, one might not find a full line of the product forcing one to go elsewhere to buy. This use to be my one stop shop, but now I have to go hunting elsewhere for simple everyday items such as onion powder. Minced onion  I can find from small to large volume, but onion powder is only found in a small volume.  This is my one complaint for this location. Other than that, Fry's is my grocery of choice.If you have not been here, get off your butt and come shop here. This like what adult dreams are made of. A wine bar, Sushi bar, cooking demos, gourmet every thing. I love this place so much It hurts.....What a great shop! Our 2001 lexus failed the emission test this year, the estimate from lexus was close to $1k, toyoworks was half that. Unfortunately another problem developed during that repair, (not their fault, age of vehicle)  Andre went way out of his way to fix it at a very minimal cost. Can't say enough good things about how we were treated.I've used ExecuCar for the past few years because it's easy to schedule my car, they're professional and on-time.  I used them this week to get me to-from the airport and as always our driver was professional, courteous and on-time.  What I really like is getting a text upon my return to Phoenix so I can call my driver after I grabbed my bags from the luggage area.I love the chicken breakfast sandwhich with egg on it. So great and surprising since I thought of this as a lunch place initially. I love the little hasbrowns too. The splenda lemondae is great for those who like healthy lemonade. great service by happy people here.These guys do a great job on time. We use them constantly for our in house manufactured products and they are consistant in color and quality every time.Get a buttered tortilla it is incredible!  I like the green machaca, get the foot long it's worth the 90 cents.

It's fast, cheap, and easy but it is good!  You can't find better inexpensive Mexican food.  The tortillas are to die for.Love this place great place to stop to eat for a person that works late service is great and enjoy the foodHole in the wall spot in a somewhat sketchy area, but definitely worth the stop if you just want some great priced food! You get WAY more food for your money than you would get anywhere else, and it's pretty tasty too. They have tons of options. If you have a large family, then definitely check it out. I've only been with one other person, but they have some killer specials for large parties that make me want to order them just cause they are that good of deals!Authentic, cheap, huge servings and incredible menu. Tasty and done right. If it's not on the menu, which would be hard to believe, they'll make it! Real Chinese doesn't get any better. Hong Kong in Mesa.My AC kept tripping breaker, started out infrequent, then was after a couple of minute. I suspected a bad breaker, but wanted it checked. Called Cool Touch, and Susan answered near closing time. Turns out phone was maybe forwarded and said she would call back when she got home to a computer. Susan called back as promised and set an appt for next day. Susan called next day to ask if I was available as the tech was running ahead of schedule, perfect! Luis was professional and confirmed my suspicion. He asked if I knew how to change out breaker to save me the markup, etc. (I did). Great experience, on- time, and the $59 service call was well worth piece of mind. Thank you Cool Touch!Great service at a great price. Much rather support these guys and get good service than run the risk of going to Best Buy. These guys really care that you are satisfied with your purchase and want to make sure you come back if you need anything else. I would recommend this shop to any of my friends!This restaurant exemplifies how to make a customer for life. I was working late on Valentine's Day and my girlfriend was at Montelucia babysitting for a tourist, so I figured I'd take the opportunity to saddle up at a bar somewhere and get a quick bite to eat. 

Houston's had a set menu and was full, Oregano's was packed to the gills and offered a small menu as well, then on to SunUp, who had a limited menu as well. By this point, I was ready to pop... I just wanted a bite to eat, but I didn't want to settle for Subway again. From the moment I arrived at St. Francis, I felt 100% welcome. I asked the valet where I could self park, he said right up front I could take any place I wanted. The hostess, when asked if I could eat at the bar, said I could make myself right at home. They were all so nice. 

I saddled up to the bar and was immediately given a "couple's" menu featuring a rather steeply priced dinner for two. I got out of my seat and before I left I asked the bartender if she happened to know of a place in the area which wouldn't be on a set menu (who knows, she might have a friend in the industry that told her where they work wasn't doing anything special.) She snarked back that they were offering the couple's menu and that was it. Perhaps she was upset she was working V-day, but she was the only unhappy person I encountered. Her bar-back was on the ball and went to get the manager, who immediately offered to get me a burger and fries! Awesome!

The French Onion Burger was fantastic. It was a very high quality and inventive way to serve a hamburger, and was sided by some great french fries and a spicy ketchup that I found to be delicious. $20 for a burger and a beer was a little more than I would expect to pay normally, but this is a VERY nice restaurant so I quickly got over it.

Overall, this is a neat spot anyway, but the overly accommodating attitude of the staff made it an easy five-star review in my book. I can only hope they are like this all the time, and if they are, they will succeed for a long time to come.Wandered in on a sunday night after a long day of traveling.

The space is beautiful, and the service gracious while not being obnoxiously over-smily. They seated us in a quiet corner, as asked. The menu is short and sweet, I had a hard time choosing something from the many delicious sounding options.

In the end I went for the white fish with moroccan spices and the apero cocktail. Totally delicious, both of them. The fish especially was wonderful, light, the spices just right. Texturally, the almonds on the top went wonderfully with the steamed green veg and flakey-creamy fish.

I live nearby and am SO happy to have found a healthy & tasty place close by. Vive St Francis!the chili verde is great hear.

i also got to meet the manager at the local first az festival this past weekend.

their butternut squash soup and sourdough bread are amazing.Went here for lunch and had the chicken salad sandwich, it was fantastic. I will never have another chicken salad sandwich anywhere else as I'll only be disappointed. Great atmosphere as well.I went here because my tires (the cheapest I could get at Wal-Mart) and weird leaking had been a problem. Gene helped me track down the leak and a wobble I've had in my car for the six years I've owned it. 

He hunted down two used wheels to replace the curb-checked ones I had been driving on and got them on in the same day. My car now drives weirdly smooth.  Trust the rest of the reviews. Gene's is a pretty awesome find.I had to get some pluming done this past week and Benjamin Franklin Plumbing did a GREAT JOB! They were on time, which was great because i had no time for just waiting around. Their tech was very professional and he fixed us up in no time! Will be using again!Yummy!!! I love their food! the blintzes with berries, o wow yum. and the eggs benedict with fresh , another yeah! wish i could go more!I'm still seeing Jason about 4 times a year. His knowledge of my spinal issues lets me know that when I have a problem he knows how to correct it.

I moved a couple years ago out of the Scottsdale area and attempted to find someone that might be able to make the adjustments I need, but all they wanted to do was up-sell me in to treatments I just don't need.

So, I continue to make the long drive up North to see Jason.

And it's totally worth it!My husband and I ate here last week using a Restaurant.com certificate.  It turned out to be SO good.  We had the Gyros Pita since we both love REAL gyros and we were not disappointed.  Having spent many years living in the Chicago area I am used to Chicago's Greek Town so kind of expected to be disappointed.  Loved it.  And the rest of the menu looks very interesting.  We will definitely return.  My only complaint is that they only had 2 handicapped parking spots and we had to park quite a ways from the door which is not fun pushing a wheelchair.  They need to add a couple spots.A diamond in the rough!  Mesa is not exactly an ethnic restaurant hot spot.  It is really hard to find anything decent, so when I heard about Benjarong, I went with high hopes.  It is hidden in a plaza, and I like to go during lunch since they always have specials.  They serve soup and a wonton and a spring roll first.  Then, your entree quickly follows.  The portions are perfect.  I always east it all without feeling too stuffed.  The servers are always friendly.Hands down the best hospital in the valley.  Clean, organized, efficient, and safe.  I love MayoAlways a great experience and some great looking nails!Very friendly people, good service, great variety on the menu. It's become a regular for a few years and the pizza? It'll be hard to find any better!The customer service alone is worth the five stars. By the third time I went there they already knew me by name. The selection is fantastic. The store has moved into a new space that opens it up and allows you to move more freely. They have hundreds of comics and dozens of toys. They offer a 10 percent discount for students and military personal.  Ken knows more about comics then any human should. I've recommended this to my friends and they fell in love with it too. I've been to several comic book stores and this is the best.My son and I happened upon Drawn To Comics while visiting downtown Glendale last week.  The staff was very friendly and greeted us as we went in the store.  The store itself was very comfortable and was packed with not only comics, but toys, collectibles, clothing and even had a nice upstairs gaming room.  The knowledgeable staff took the time to ask us what we were interested in seeing, and helped us find a few books.  The owner was very friendly and even though we only bought a few books took the time to introduce himself when he checked us out.  Even though I don't live in Glendale I will go out of my way to shop at Drawn To Comics again.  Highly recommended.Holy smokes! Ordered some retractable banners at around 11:00am. In walks the delivery guy at 2:30pm the same afternoon with the banners. That is a crazy-fast turn-around time. The banners looked great too. Way to go, FDS.Exceeded my expectations!  I hired Warren's on behalf of an out of state client who needed ALL of the contents of his vacation home moved into storage.  The guys showed up on time and expertly packaged and moved all the contents and moved them to the storage unit w/o a problem on their part.  As a Realtor, I'd gladly recommend them to anyone!I really like this library. It is so big and filled with so many books! I visit all the time with my daughter. We go to the story time and movement and music events they hold. She enjoys the events and has really learned to live reading. 

This library has great children's library too. The librarians are all friendly and seem to enjoy the kiddos. 

The library also holds all sorts of events for babies, kids, teens, and adults. Make sure to check the monthly calendar  to see what you want to do.  It is a great community place and I am happy it is so close to me.Excellent!! Simply superb sushi restaurant!! I have been here numerous times and have never been disappointed. Elegant ambiance with an incredible view of the Las Vegas Strip. The food is always fresh and the service is top notch. Good happy hour, friendly staff and great bar tenders who know how to mix a great drink!! General Manager, Johnny Seo is magnificent and knows how to cater to his clientele to keep them coming back again and again!!Brewed Tea: YES

I STILL come here regularly. I love the service, the food, the prices, and the certificates I get on restaurant . com.WOW! I was super impressed. 

For a while I've been reading Yelp reviews on nail salons and no salon jumped up at me so, I never got my nails did......til this past weekend. I got my hair did and I felt like I needed some pampering so, I just went to the this spot..only cause it was near my house. I was kinda hesitant about the pricing because it's the only nail spot in Southern Highlands and I assumed they charged you an arm, leg, and nail.

The lady I got was Vanna. She was SUPER helpful and knowledgeable about nails and what's popular. I got gel nails with silver glitter. She was really precise and took pride in her work. So much pride that she even said if I had any problems or complaints afterwards that she wants to correct the problems. I was like, "wow!?!" I mean, what nail tech wants to correct her mistakes after the fact??!
I assume she's the best in the shop just cause all the customers knew her and some were even mad that I was with her cause they kept requesting her. 

Thankfully, now I know where AND who to see when I get my nails did. In fact, I was kinda hesitant to share the nail tech's name just cause I want her to myself :p 

Another great thing about Vanna was she cut the cuticles after doing my nails. They looked so clean =) 

And I only paid $45 for the service (w/o tip) which is pretty reasonable. I was expecting $60.


In the words of Drake: "Nails did. Hair did. Everything big. Oh, you FANCY huh!?!"Best place to get your fix for crab, always friendly welcomeThis company is terrific... Resolved our car issue so quickly and we got a great price!  This is one car place where you can really trust what they tell you. 5 stars for service and quality.Again I was here for work and I was able to try out the Strip House in Planet Hollywood Resort and Casino ;D It's on the second floor of the casino next to Stomp! Out Loud. This is a bit nicer place to go to, so walking up without reservations isn't suggested, and if you make reservations be sure you have everyone with you before you get in because they won't seat you until you have everyone in your party. 

The decor in this place is pretty neat, ok, maybe it's just me but when I go to a steak house and I hear its called "the Strip House" I didn't think of strippers; until I saw the walls of this place, tastefully decorated with photographs of strippers from the 1920s - 1940s with leather seating, redwood everywhere, and deep reed painted walls makes this feel like a mans place to eat, all you need is a Vegas 5 Cigar with your steak. 

Another plus is the wine selection, a little higher priced than at any other steak house, well except for maybe Flemings Steakhouse in Northridge. 
And order the steak for two because it is the best piece of meat that you will ever have....EVER! 

And of course, Enjoy!I love going to Downtown - to me, this is the real Vegas, the one that I remember from my childhood. The strip is for suckers, tourists and people who don't know any better. This place has much more character. I've taken friends and family, who were visiting from out of town, to the Fremont Street Experience, and they've all enjoyed it thoroughly - from the old casinos, the decent food, the live music, the street performers to the ziplines, it's all good! Yes, you'll probably encounter hustlers, pimps, hos, junkies and beggars here (as in any other major city), but part of the fun is seeing people from all walks of life!I had an infected tooth and to say it was bothering me is putting it way lightly. I looked at available dentist places in the area and to see what was recommended. I called them up to see about appointments and about not having insurance. They were very courteous even over the phone about how much procedures cost, and even went step by step what was going to happen. They even offer 20% off for some procedures for patients without insurance. I made my appointment, and from the moment I went in they were very nice and helpful. The dentist is actually the person who owns the business. She went over my options with me, how much everything was going to cost, and was very friendly. I hate needles, and have had bad dentists experiences in the past, with this dentist, if she could tell that I was remotely in pain she would slow down ask if everything is okay, if I needed more numbing she didn't hesitate to make me feel more relaxed  and comfortable given the situation. She kept talking to me throughout the procedure and I will be going back to this dentist. I will also recommend anyone who needs to see a dentist to come here.I've gotten my hair cut here several times and colored once. Jessica always takes care of me and makes my hair look even better than what I imagined coming in. 
I love having a salon that I can regularly come back to. Especially when Jessicas daughter keeps me company when I get my hair done ;)Love everything about this place!!  Staff is great, KT and Sam and the rest of their team. They keep the place clean and bulbs changed regularly. And I am tan and happy.  Thanks Palm Beach!!!I went into this gallery with no idea who Peter Lik was. I was very impressed by his work. I thought this space was a nice break from all the fashion stores around it. My friends had a great time looking at the photographs. Does anyone have thousands of dollars to give me so I can buy his work? hahaI've used Dr. C for several years. He is calm, and fast.  A great dentist. Cleanings are great. Staff is very pleasant. Can't go wrong if you are looking for a competent, relaxed dentist who knows your mouth :)From walking in the door to exiting the staff are top notch!  They were happy to see me and greeted me as I walked in the door!  I waited only a few minutes before getting started with my appointment.  Dr. Lee is amazing!  We actually had a full conversation during my appointment.  She is very personable and easy to get along with.  She answered all of my questions.  I left feeling confident about my exam and my options. I will definitely  return to Optic Gallery in the future!They've been updating this mall for a LONG, LONG time. There are more department stores, valets, and boutiques than your average bear... Surely, if this wasn't only a few blocks from Caesar's Forum Shops then this would be a lot more popular to tourists. Personally, I like this place a lot and will come here whenever I visit Vegas.I feel really guilty for loving this place especially because I am with the "anti- fast-food chains" movement in America. But this is the quintessential palace of chicken for me. This is my ultimate splurge of fried goodness. I actually dream of this place while eating chicken at other restaurants.  Why do I love this place so much? Simplicity. Chicken fingers, fries, toast and iced tea. That's the main attraction and that's really all they serve. If you make a good product, stick with it and run with the idea. So I humbly "bow in the presence of greatness" and I am a proud member of the Caniac Club.I have been to this location several times for tire repair due to picking up large nails on the roadway. Today I stopped by when my low tire pressure light came on.  I was treated incredibly well.  Steven filled up all four of my tires with air and took the time to help me understand what my tires need, how to tell the age of a tire, and where to find the information on my car about the right tire pressure.  He was terrific.  They have always been very helpful and friendly at this center.   I drove from the south side of town to this location because I have come to trust the staff there.I enjoy going to tonys the food and service are great. You can't beat the prices and they serve beer :)Best flat bread pizza I have ever had.  
Best wedding cake too!

Very reasonably priced, with a great view of the Shark tank.  
Bottle of wine, appetizer, pizza, and dessert came out to under $65.  
Nine days in LV and this was the best place I ate.  Highly recommended!

Not to mention the service was exceptional!A MUST SEE!!! We see his show every time we're in Las Vegas (a couple times per year). No matter how many times I watch his show, I can't help but to laugh all the way through!! It's almost more fun knowing what's coming next although, he always has new material based on current events. I can't say enough good about him! Carrot Top is the BEST!!!i love filipino food... however, i "love" it only when it comes to my family's cooking.  i'm biased, i know.  every time i eat dishes others have made, i have a tendency to compare it to my family's.  there are only a limited number of ones who come up to snuff.  anywho, this place has just been added to my list.  the food here tastes good.  i visited this restaurant both times i was in vegas.  first visit - we walked in and each were given a cup of hot soup.  there were so many choices of food and all looked so appetizing.  i decided on the bistek and bbq pork on a stick.  those entrees with the rice and a glass of mango juice certainly satisfied me.

i revisited the restaurant 3 days in a row during my second trip.  i'm giving it 5 stars for the consistency in the good quality food that they served.  i tried the dinuguan, which was alright, and the pork apritada, which i really really liked.  i was excited to find out that they have 2 other restaurants, both of which are located in socal.  hopefully the food at the other restaurants taste just as yummy.  if not, then i'm gonna have to plan another trip to vegas.  =)Sooo good! Great price, good portions! This may be my favorite place for hearty meals! Such good hearty food choices, I actually thought this was a mexican restaurant, i'm not disappointed it wasn't. Yummy!This is mine and my husbands FAVORITE Mexican restaurant!

When you sit down they bring you chips, salsa and beans, all fresh and good! 

But we always start off with the Queso Fundido!!! This in itself  is worth the 5 star rating!!! They serve it with fresh (and i mean fresh, they lady makes them right there) tortillas! It doesnt get any better than this people!

After filling up on that i usually get the shrimp quesedilla's, always good, but i can only eat one or two of them cause im soo full and bring the rest home for the husband to eat the next day or something.

I highly recommend this place for good quality mexican food!!! The service is good, we go there a lot and the waiters know us by face and smile and stop by and say hi when we get seated if we are not in there section!

There are a few over the valley and we've been to about 3..ohh no wait 4! the one on sunset is our fav (and the closest to our house) and the one on Decatur is great as well.. the new one on flamingo and fortapache (i think thats where it was) was not our favorite though, it was different and we didnt like the Queso Fundido, which is the best part of it all!!I LOVE Rocco's!! After living in Vegas for 3 years (from NJ), I'm glad I found Rocco's NY Pizzeria. I must admit, there's tons of places in NY & NJ that make a wayy better slice, but for Vegas, this is the best. I hate that there's so many pizzarias in town that claim to be NY pizza (i.e. Joe's New York Pizza) and it's nothing like an east coast pizza at all. Rocco's is the only place I've been to out here that tastes anything like an east coast pizza and trust me, I know.. I've been eating pizza from North NJ and NYC for 23 years.  Anyways, my favorite from Rocco's is the white pizza and pepperoni with sausage. YUM.  I tried one of their sandwiches before but it wasn't that great. Normally places that have good pizza have bad everything else. So I just stick to the pizza when I go there. I also love that they have Wise chips there since they don't carry them in many Vegas grocery stores. They also have a little italian ice stand in the summer which is nice. Their italian ice is super yummy as well!Fantastic food from the 90% stuffed Crab Cakes to the Filets and Crab legs and finishing with the best Key Lime Pie in Vegas this place is top notch.Oh Joe's, How I love thee, Let me count the ways...

#1 Excellent service. Really top notch!
#2 Possibly one of the best steaks I have ever had. Ever.
#3 The freshest shrimp cocktail I have ever had!
#4 Side dishes so delicious yet not too delicious to distract from the main entrees.
#5 Banana cream pie to die for!

My husband and I stop here every trip to Vegas and we are never disappointed. Sitting by the bar, or enjoying a romantic evening in the restaurant, you will definitely have a good experience!In typical Vegas fashion, I was running late to Mix and got there at 11:15 which is 15 minutes after they're supposed to have closed the kitchen but somehow they waited for my order which we placed at around 11:30...very cool...and I gotta say, this meal ranks in the top 5 steak dinners I've had in Vegas so I'm glad I got to finally got to try this place out.

I ordered the "special" which came with a filet topped with foie gras and black truffles (see pic).  Both the filet and foie gras were excellent, however the truffles I was looking forward to turned out to be nothing special.  The dish also came with a side of mashed potatoes which I thought were ok but again amazing...Believe it or not, the hit of the night was the "mac and cheese",....you might be thinking "wtf", but yes, it was THAT good.  The macaroni was perfectly "al dente" and the cheese tasted tangy like gruyere but I forgot to ask...I highly recommend you try this.  I also got a chance to try my friend's chicken dish and I was amazed how good that was as well.  The skin was perfectly crispy and the meat was tender and juicy.  I forgot what boutique California blend my friend ordered but it opened up nicely and made the steak and foie gras that much better.  For dessert we shared the complimentary madelines w/ nutella and also munched on our friend's bday dish which amounted to something resembling a snickers bar but 5x richer and included some actual 24kt gold leafing on it which I'm told was edible.  Service was good and the view from the restaurant is one of the best on the strip.  Pricing is Vegas-style so expect to pay $80-100 per person not including alcohol, tax or tip.  Overall 4.5 stars for the food and decor and an extra half star for keeping the kitchen open a little later for us and not kicking us out when we were still there past 1am.

PS. I'm told the hand blown glass bubbles in the dining room cost $2 million alone...pretty cool (see pic).Wanted to go to an Alan Ducasse restaurant for, oh, I dunno, forever, but never had the chance.  So off to Vegas to try Mix.

Usually, when I am so amped up about something the actual thing is a let down.  Only the elite places can you build up so much in your mind and still be impressed with what they deliver.  Mix is just such a place.  I was completely blown away by the décor.  One of the most beautiful restaurant interiors I have ever seen.  And the view is not too shabby either, that top-floor-look-at-the-strip thing.

The food?  Sublime.  It was a few months ago so don't remember everything ordered, but it was all great.  I will always remember, however, my entrée.  A ribeye with foie gras, black truffles, and bourbon sauce.  Giant pieces of perfectly seared foie gras.  Mounds of truffle shavings.  Perfectly prepared steak.  One of the best dishes I have ever had.

I have developed an affinity for staying at TheHOTEL, but staying there in the future is going to incite a pitched battle between my soul, pulled by the siren song of Mix, and my wallet.Pasta shop is my favorite! It's very quaint & cozy! Reservation is a must! Love the owners. They always remember your name. The menu is awesome & the portions are perfect size. The art on the walls is way cool. It's a great place for a dinner date.As good as it gets. We have not gotten better Mexican food in Las Vegas. I come from the Mid West, my husband comes from the North West, we have searched for over 3 years to find equivalent Mexican here and at last have found it! My chicken enchilada with mole sauce to die for and his big burrito the size of your face. Check out the photos here, very helpful.

Ambience a notch up from fast food, great wait staff, nice decor, comfortable chairs, great prices. Seats 50. We spent $24 dinner for 2, and were stuffed. Couldn't eat it all & took home leftovers. If you are looking for impression, take your date to Mundo (restaurant in World Market Center, $$$), if you just want great Mexican food, in a nice setting, at a really great price ($). Go here. We will be going again & again.I've gone to Amanda several times, and each time I'm more impressed than the last.  My cut and color always look awesome!  Last week, I had the Brazilian Keratin treatment done, and it's totally AMAZING!  I used to have to use a handful of different products to keep my hair tamed, but after the keratin treatment, after just blow drying it a little with a round brush, it's even smoother than it's ever been, and it doesn't even take half the time to dry as I've gotten used to.When you purchase a Michael Kors or Emporio Armani watch, you are basically buying a Fossil.

The reason why is that most handbag and apparel fashion houses don't have time to put together their own watch designs out of scratch. Very few of them do, and they outsource their design elements to people like Fossil. For example, Fossil builds Michael Kors watches while Movado makes Coach watches. Ask the full price stores themselves if you don't believe me.

Anyways, that being said, Fossil employees are alot more knowledgeable about the warranty details of YOUR WATCH from Michael Kors or Armani than the original retailer themselves. They usually can provide replacement straps on the spot, reinstall batteries, while offering to mail your broken watch to the warehouse if the issue is more complicated. 

I have two broken Fossil based watches and this store resolved all of them. They mailed my Michael Kors watch back to their warehouse and sold me a strap for my Fossil Twist after the original one broke. The manager merely glanced at my broken wrist strap and immediately identified it as a 22mm strap.

Thats a whole lot better of a response than hearing "Call the number" from the warranty card of your watch that you have inevitably lost. Remember when you purchased a brand spanking new car stereo for your car and they gave you that stupid remote? Who the hell uses that?OMG Awesome!

Great Tacos, if you go on a Sunday expect a line!

Great Prices, Great Food, Great Service!

A little hard to find, and if you are specific about food, you might want to bring a Spanish speaker.

I will definitely become a regular!So good!  Great service, everyone was delightful; and excellent food.  The banana french toast was *perfect*.  Best brunch place I've been to in the area. A+.Amazing place!! I was first introduced here by my Mother and Father in law.  I had the filet mignon and it was perfect! It was tender juicy just the way I expected for a perfect steak.  The second time we dined here was with my wife, and the gentleman who was sitting next to us on his way out recommended the rib eye on bone. Let me just say that the rib eye was almost bigger than my head and the flavor with just the perfect spices made every bite salivating for the next one.  This is my first review and I highly recommend The Charcoal Room and when you do.. Ask for the Rib Eye on bone.   I promise you will not regret the choice!  :)This is listed as a barber shop, but let me tell you, this ain't just a barber shop. If you want to pamper the man in your life, send him here. I'll bet after a lovely session, he'll never go back to just shaving himself ever again.

This is a shave shop/barber shop in the old style. They lather your face up and then shave you with a straight edge blade. This establishment has been around since 1805 and started in England (surprise, surprise). Not only do they offer services but they also have a line of products for sale ranging from shaving brushes, creams, lotions etc.

I guess this is to men what cosmetic lines such as Shiseido, Clarins, La Mer is to women. I don't get it, but then again, I doubt hubby gets it either when I buy shit for my face.This place is the real deal. 

 - Friendly, check. 
 - Great stock of brands and accessories, check.
 - Knowledgeable staff, check. 

Did I mention friendly, like go above and beyond to normal customer service to find you what you need? Excellent service. The day I went Sam helped me and not only did she get me into THE perfect pair of shoes, but she also took the time to review my running form.  Since they record you running on the treadmill to check out how your feet hit the ground, she also took the camera to the side and from the front to see what my hips and upper body were doing.  So, not only did I walk away with a new pair of shoes I also walked away with some pointers on how to become a better runner.  Sam also followed up with an e-mail including links to videos/workouts to help me build my core.  

Just a wonderful experience altogether!!After doing a lot of research on Yelp and not finding a great-sounding chinese buffet, we went here b/c its close to our house and looks nice from the outside. It was amazing! Two long tables of hot buffet items, and  a very sizeable sushi table, which was actually REALLY good, especially for being part of a buffet. The service was good, and it was very reasonably priced. There were typical desserts and a "salad" bar that was just ok...but everything else was amazing, we will definitely go back. Shrimp and sno peas was great, and they had good salmon and tuna sushi/sashimi. I definitely recommend it!The girls at Celebrate Kids are friendly, helpful, and great!!!

The products they provide are top notch and we have never been disappointed...

We have used them several times and we now exclusively use them.

WWW.COVENTRYNEIGHBORHOODWATCH.COMMy wife visited here for the first time. The service was excellent. We never had to refill our own hot tea, nor did any plate sit finished on our table. 
The decor and aquarium inside add to the comfortable atmosphere.  
I ordered the wok fried scallops and loved it. The XO sauce was yummy. 
We will be back for more, no question.Venti Awake Tea Latte non fat sweetened with splenda is the way to go!!

come on its starbucks... who doesnt like them?My wife and I visited the Envy Steakhouse on Saturday, April 14, 2012 and it was an amazing experience!  We had visited one other time a couple of years ago and we thought the service and food was great and that is why we decided to go back again this time.  This time, however, was very special. My wife and I were celebrating our 5 year anniversary on this night and everything was perfect. Joshua our waiter was very attentive and informative. He explained everything from their wine selection to the Chef's special and even the 3 three types of salt they had and what to use them on.  After dinner we engaged in small talk with Joshua were he discovered the purpose of our visit.  Joshua left and a few minutes later came back with desert for us compliments of Chef Michael.  They wrote on the plate Happy Anniversary with dark melted chocolate. A few minutes later Chef Michael came out to our table to meet us and chat. Later the manager came by to make sure our dining experience had been a good one. Joshua made our night very special, the food was amazing and we really appreciate that Chef Michael took the time to come out and personally wish us a happy anniversary!  We will definitely visit the Envy Steakhouse each time we visit Vegas!I cannot fully describe how happy this place makes me.  I am a theater geek and have been dying for a real theater in Vegas ever since I moved here.  This is not like the many theaters on the Strip that cut a show down to a 60-90 minute version of itself just so everyone can be herded back to the slot machines.  The Smith Center is finally here, it's built for us locals, and it has so many great programs to offer.

This review is for Reynolds Hall.

I was here for the first concert (Bela Fleck, not the super expensive gala) and I have to say this place is amazing.  There is gorgeous marble everywhere, beautiful lighting, stunning architecture, and all within an Art Deco theme.  Step inside The Smith Center and you will feel transported to 1928 in New York City.

Despite having four (yes, four) balconies, the elevators are surprisingly easy to deal with.  I did leave during the encore so perhaps that helped with the wait time.  The balconies are small and intimate and you can easily see over the people in front of you.  I was sitting in the Gallery (or 3rd balcony) and the seats weren't as bad as I imagined they would be.  A smidge higher than I would have liked but certainly not a bad view like you would picture for a third balcony.  I would try to get tickets in the section below (Dress Circle) if you can.

The bathrooms are large and there wasn't too long of a wait time.  Try to wait a few minutes after intermission begins to avoid the lines.  The lines for the bar, however, are long throughout the entire intermission.  There were two small bars in the Upper Lobby (right outside of the Gallery) and I didn't even bother to try to get anything.  I didn't see any pricing for the alcohol.

Speaking of the Upper Lobby, there is a beautiful view from the terrace that is located on this floor.  You can view Symphony Park (the outdoor venue) just below and downtown Las Vegas is to the right.  The beautiful view will be marred by smokers however, so unless that's your thing don't expect to stay out here for too long.

The acoustics at Reynolds Hall are one word: outstanding.  Even though we were high up in the Gallery, we still heard everything as though we were sitting a few rows back from the stage.  It doesn't get any better than this.

I have dreamt of a place like The Smith Center for the few years I've lived in Vegas and I have to thank everyone that contributed in any way.  You have provided us not only with a performance arts theater but a beautiful building for the downtown area, a learning space for the children of Vegas, a gathering place for friends and families, inspiration from the performances, architecture and art at your theater, and a sense that this town is finally starting to care for its own.  Las Vegas is grateful.The rooms are epic....the view from floor .52 corner suite will leave a memory unfetchedSometimes chain resturants are not the best. However, this place is very good. Always like the menu items. There is a  lot to choose from. You could never say you don't like what is on the menu.   The Decor is really nice, Love the Big Elelphant up front in the waiting area. Servers are very attentive and friendly.  Nice and clean, lots of parking. Very convienant when you are right at the mall. Plus they sometimes have coupons, even better. We will be back.My favorite terriyaki chicken EVER...Get the crispy terriyaki chicken and you shouldn't be disappointed!!  I never am.This place is awesome!!!!!  
Oysters are so delicious and sweet.   The best and cheapest in the las vegas valley.  

crawfish were delicious, but don't order it too hot as the spice overwhelms the delicate crawfish meat.  Mild still gives a good kick.  

The shrimp are cooked with the heads which makes the plump shrimp meat so delicious and moist.  

A helpful tip is to get there before 5:30pm on friday and saturday, otherwise you will be waiting for a while to get seated.The food is so spicy, it's a nice burn. Buffalo wild wings blazin wings rips my stomach apart and other parts. Hot and Juicy is hot enough to satisfy. Eating the hot rice was a marathon. 

Usually when we eat here I have trouble keeping the bill under $80. However!..... this last time I ordered 1lb shrimp and my sweet heart ordered black mussels with 2 pieces of corn and a cup of rice. The total was like $27 bucks.We were a party of 6 and we put away at least 4 lbs of snow crab, 4 lbs of shrimp, 8 lbs of crawfish, 2 orders of fried catfish, plus corn for everyone. The food was excellent. After eating on the strip, we wanted something different. This was well worth it. We should have gone there earlier in the trip. Martha our waitress was extremely helpful and patient. This is a must stop for lunch when in Vegas.Quick and simple!One of the favorite Thai restaurants. Fresh quality food, great prices, friendly staff. The venue has nice decor and welcoming. I love the beef salad.Pastrami not as good as Carnegie on The Strip, but their desserts, knishes and matzo ball soup are to die for! Best items:
Greatest hamantaschen in town with a nice chewy cookie with a lemony zest! Rugelach are excellent as well. Try the raspberry with cream cheese or the chocolate. Black and white's are awesome. Of course there's the bagels. These are some of the best homemade knishes in town with golden crusts and fluffy, garlicky fillings that scream eat me! 
Babka is good as well. The challah is good quality, but not quite as good as Weiss Deli in Henderson. Also, I prefer the smoked whitefish of Weiss and Levy's to their chunkier variety. The celery and other hunks detract from the smooth smokiness that I crave. 
The stuffed cabbage is good, but not as good as Carnegie on The Strip. The brisket dinner I had once was decent, but I've had much better.The char-crust on the burgers are friggin' ridonculous! Every bite is an explosion of flavorness and juiciness, and whichever other 'ness' you could imagine.

The Garlic fries here have utterly ruined any other chance that any other garlic fry out there would have-ever.  I have not tasted their equal anywhere! First taste brings me back to my childhood.  With it's escargot-like butter concoction, I lost my mind!  They get extra points for the pool of residue that collects at the bottom of the fry boat. My mouth is literally watering as I type...sigh

Chocolate shake rounds out the dining experience due to it's bombness! get a spoon, they're thickness.

Clearly they have more to offer, but I have found the magic equation and will stick to it.  The pizzas do look good however....The remodel  is stunning. The restaurant was beautiful before and now it's even more lovely. Great food, service was impeccable. I love the white glove service & gold flatware .The most delicious hamburger not just on the Strip,but  ANYWHERE!!!  We had a to go order that was piping hot when we picked it up. BUT the fries were even good hours later--COLD.. lol.. Love the new milkshakes Mango Coconut and Peanut Butter... We had an appetizer in El Segundo the Mex place next door. The server Jose E.. Just ask for the Jose with 6 or 7 kids...is awesome... I met my boyfriends daughters for the first time. I was quite nervous but he made us all relax.  They are very kid friendly which is almost impossible to find on the Strip.. Strip isnt exactly Disney Land.. So check out for a relaxed,fun,kid friendly place...take out or dine in...One of the true gems of the East Valley. Walter is a true character, and is very passionate about good food. I told him his food was amazing and he said "No, Not amazing. Normal! People are just used to bad food." Seriously, just eat whatever he suggests. They have the real deal meats and cheeses. Guanciale, Bresaola, Finochiata, Gorgonzole Dolce, Pecorino Tuscano, Borchetto al Tartuffo! 

The list goes on and on. Here's a full review of one of my visits: http://forkvsfood.com/?p=126I love these big ol burritos in my mouth!! HAHA.

Well seriously, I've NEVER got a bad Chipotle item. I usually always get either the chicken burrito or the chicken bowl. Today I got my beloved chicken burrito! I got there 11:09 am and was like "oh crap, I'm probably like the first one here!" Boy was I wrong, there were already like 6 ppl in line!! It was my turn and I ordered my chicken burrito. The lady asked what salsa I wanted and I pointed to the hot one and she started putting pico on it!! I was like "No!!" but def not in a mean way, more of a please gosh no way. I totally hate tomatoes. I pretty much scared her. Oppsie!! Anyway, she was super nice to take them out and put some yummy hot salsa on there!! They wrapped up my perfect burrito and I got my chips and guac on the side and paid.

Since I was driving to get my scripts I tore through the burrito on the road, thank God no one was listening to me eat it. They may have thought I was doing something naughty! Which I was!! Desfrutando in my delicious orgasmic burrito!! Ahh Chipotle, me love you long time!If you are looking for a quality exterminator you won't get anyone better than Apple.  Upon moving into our new home we noticed a roach and ant problem.  Apple was the only exterminator that had any reviews so I gave them a call.  
It is one of the best calls I have made.  Apple shows up once a month for regular service as well as other times as needed.  i.e. when my nasty ant problem appears every summer. 
After two years of service, I have nothing to complain, these guys are top notch.Located inside Suncoast Hotel and Casino on the second floor, this was not my first choice as I wanted to eat Japanese and not steak or red meat. However, my friend who I just meet the previous day invited my friend and I to enjoy her comps worth $400.00 at this restaurant.

I was worried it would not meet my expectations for the kind of high roller dinners you would find in Vegas. You see this is the kind of place only locals go to since it is approximately 30 minutes away from what we all know as The Strip.

So we had a comp of $400 and two drinks per dinner, my friend and I could not pass up an opportunity to eat till we literally exploded. NO buffet dinner for us that night. Of course, our comps were use it all or lose and we went for it all. 

Whle they were setting up our table, we enjoyed our compliementary cocktails: California Riesling, Grey Goose Tonic and Grey Goose Cranberry. I wanted Belvedere but they only carry GG. Since it took some time to set up the table, we asked to preview the menu so we would know what to expect. Normally we would not order at the bar but we could not wait for the "festivities" to begin. 

Once we were seated, we started with a seafood platter consisting of shrimp cocktail, crab legs, and oysters. The presentation alone caused diners around us to stop and take in what they weren't having. We got seated in a booth where you couldn't help from being watched as you were eating. My party was able to enjoy the Las Vegas Valley view when we weren't gorging ourselves on our dinners. 

Next came the main entrees: porterhouse with mashed potatoes, crab legs with a veal loin medallion, and a huge baked Australian lobster tail. Everything was top notch and knowing it was all free sweetened the deal. 

For dessert, we had a platter with 4 types of sweets. However, I was fiending for bananas foster and they threw that in. All in all, we had a hugh chocolate brownie, creme brulee, fresh berries with sambuca, strawberry cheesecake and the bananas foster. Oh they lite on fire the container of fresh berries with the sambuca. Yum yum!!! 

Service was first-rate and better than when my friends and I dined at the Bellagio. The dinner ended up costing us no more than $60 as we only needed to pay for tip. I would come back again.I hadn't been back to Phoenix in 22 year.  Yes, 22 years, and oh my how it's changed!  So many new freeways and high rise buildings!  But more importantly, new restaurants!!!  

Not knowing the area well, my friend's daughter suggested this place for dinner.  It was Saturday night around 8:00pm and I was really happy we didn't have to wait at all.  Parking is at the back of the restaurant parking lot.  We entered the restaurant back entrance via an outdoor patio where people were enjoying a AZ summer night.  

I loved the restaurant as soon as I stepped in.  It's very modern and open.  In front of me was a  nice bar.  Our table was reserved for us and we were seated right away.  Once we ordered, the food came out fairly quickly.  

I had the Spinach Feta Salad with Chicken (add on) with balsamic vinaigrette. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/-Ht7HiGBox8lS1Y8IPjO8g?select=pw0Zm0E7aFdzpdY6pBXXBQ It was delicious!  They weren't stingy with the meat and I was only able to eat about 1/3 of chicken but I finished all of my salad!  

My fiance had the T ruffled Hanger Stead (medium). He said it was very tender with good flavor.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/-Ht7HiGBox8lS1Y8IPjO8g?select=sacBv9z6S1zq2UzlMohXAA

Others ordered Spicy Burger http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/-Ht7HiGBox8lS1Y8IPjO8g?select=koApdgY9xe4mt1aTMFs0tA, Wedge Fries http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/-Ht7HiGBox8lS1Y8IPjO8g?select=pJD2rltJ-SGsn226U56TDA, Le Mans French Dip http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/-Ht7HiGBox8lS1Y8IPjO8g?select=Lumr-KdIUA6v8T8Ofbyjfw, Chicken Sandwich http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/-Ht7HiGBox8lS1Y8IPjO8g?select=TffVc2HLohKZstKe53DCAQ, and Salmon Western http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/-Ht7HiGBox8lS1Y8IPjO8g?select=LS5UAhL7N68h-2pn4uCSTQ, which looked sooooo good.  If I ever return, I'm going to try this!

Our server was super nice and attentive.  The sandwiches are pretty big, so if you're a small eater, you might be packing 1/2 of to go.  They also have Happy Hour everyday.  If you're in this part of the town, give it a try.  You might like it as much as I did!How have I not gotten around to reviewing this place?!?

I don't have an off-the-rack body. My upper body is lanky and my thighs are huge.

It's been a few months since I came here for their three suit special. The selection was fair and I really like the slimmer cuts they carried. I opted to have the slacks tailored at Brothers, plus purchased two belts. I look and feel like a million dollars wearing these suits--execs at work have complimented me on looking sharp, and the homeless think I have cash to spare.

The customer service was just fantastic! I never felt pressured to purchase anything, 
 
However, it should be mentioned these aren't top-of-the line garments. I'm a beast on buttons and have had to stitch a couple buttons back on the jackets. That said, I cannot praise Brothers Tailors and Clothing Company enough.Classy as it gets... if you want to impress this is THE bar/lounge to visit. Elements restaurant is up here too. Hard to find 1st time (about a mile east of Scottsdale rd. on McDonald).

You have to try the "Grapefruit and Basil Martini" (I don't even like grapefruit, but this is perfect).Health nut or not go check it out . There's not another place in all the kingdom that's better....well this local kingdom, anyway!
It's got a lot to offer and is very clean, safe and well run with professional staff readily willing to offer a hand or lend an ear if needed.
Even though there is a lot to do on the inside, the outdoors is also very welcoming. Check their loaded schedule and they'll fit you in. Overall it's a great value, don't miss out!Amazing place to have a beer and the food was amazing.The rolls are all named after popular drugs from the 70's lol how could you go wrong? In all seriousness aside from nobu at the hard rock this is the best sushi in town. It is without question the best sushi in summerlin. I went with a friend and his parents (who happen to be high rollers at the red rock). We were treated very well and as the meal was a comp we tried almost everything worth trying on the menu. Sometimes Vegas really pays you back, this was definitely one of those times for me.

Try the tuna, it's pricey but if you're looking for a piece of fish that will melt in your mouth this is it. The manager walked by and showed us his iPad he said every day his guy in Hawaii goes to the local fish markets and sends him pictures. His sushi chef here then picks the best cuts and they are flown in fresh every day. He pointed to my plate "that was swimming in the ocean, less than 24 hours ago". Needless to say I was impressed. 

I'm definitely going back, probably with a date. This place has a stunning decor and would be the ideal place for a trendy night out. 

Highly recommend and by the way the hostesses are gorgeous. Lol not that I pick restaurants based on such things, just happened to notice :)Had heard so much about this place, we had to go and eat there. It was wonderful!!! I am still stuffed and its been 3 hours since we ate.The shredded beef taco and all of the burritos are delicious.Love the local feel of this place. Their green enchilada sauce is outstanding. I try to come here as often as a I can when I'm in Ahwatukee. I always get their #2 Green Chile burrito... Consistently amazing.You will not find any better person than Eytan to sharpen your prized knife or to give you all of the information you need to buy a new one. As a home cook and former restaurant cook there is nothing like cutting with a knife Eytan has sharpened for me! I will go back again and again..Great food and service.I thought this would be an easy kill.

I was already perturbed at their sales staff for standing me up on a previous appointment... so when the 'free week' coupon came in the mail, I foresaw my Yelpers revenge, for my mission was to scribe their demise, at their hand.

-Day 1-
It was a sweltering August Sunday afternoon.  A slight breeze blew as I walked across the parking lot towards the reception desk.  Every few steps, a wisp of chlorine from the outdoor pool would reach me.  The absence of smiles from the faces of each exiting member told me that I was about to be part of something special.

The associate at the front desk invited me to peruse the complex in return for my signature.  I looked up from my autograph session to behold a large plasma TV serving up music videos.

As I walked into the mouth of the beast, one word came to mind... conglomerate.  Yes, this was a Herculean aggregation of raw fitness potential.  Passing by several vacant mini-meeting rooms, I pondered the sheer number of financial obligations which had been entered into.

The men's dressing room left me in awe.  I beheld cherry wood lockers and granite countertops.  Surely these are materials which doctors and lawyers would afford in their grand country clubs.  Oh my, I see a chorus line of fancy chrome plated hair dryers.

Good lord, the bathrooms are sealed off.  No longer would I have to be subject to the smells and sounds of hunkered patrons working through their 'man-cramps' (aka: stewing chamber pot chili).

Their aquatic offering was subdivided into an indoor and an outdoor water park.  A 5 lane lap pool, Olympic pool with 2 water slides, 2 jacuzzis and a sauna comprised the indoor kingdom, while a 4 lane lap pool, huge swimming/playing pool with 2 slides and a mushroom constituted the outdoor funfair.

Yay!  They had the obligatory bleach blonde lifeguard.  Schwing!  [gyrate hips forward]

A misting system provides a cooler climate for heat conscious loungers, and an on-site snack bar offered wrap and salad alternatives to the commonplace fare.  The outdoor area was clamoring with harmonies (screaming kids) typical of a public pool.

The 2nd floor of the facility is reserved for the rows of workout machines.  There are no less than 23 giant video screens built into the walls.

OK Lifetime Fitness, you win round one.  But there are so many other levels which you can fail at, and six days to do it.

Update 07/28/2008:

OK, I cant be hating any more.  I love this place and became a member after they threw some cool perks my way.  You wanna try something new?  Check out the class with the pilates machine.So Good!I was introduced to Brasserie V by my sister who is quite the fan. She has been raving about their frites and tap beer. Usually, when someone talks so highly about a place it builds the expectation and I'm usually left disappointed. Luckily, this place met all expectations and more!

We came during a late lunch on a Wednesday afternoon. It was busy, but not packed and we were able to find a seat immediately. It's located on Monroe street, so parking may be difficult during peak hours. It's a long and narrow building with an old pub feel. The bar takes up quite a bit of space, as it should. The beers are deserving of a nice bar. 

The service was pleasant and attentive. Food was excellent. I had a Caprese and my sister had a croque monsieur. We shared the frites. Definitely a must order. They came with their house aioili as well as a Greek style aioili. According to my sis, they change up one and in the past have had flavors such as lavender. 

The beer menu can be overwhelming, but unless you're there for something specific I would stick with the taps. Saison Dupont is an excellent choice if you like a Farmhouse Ale. But, you could always ask the waiters, they are pretty good with recommendations. 

All, in all, a great (and interesting) place to eat and try new beers.One of the best meals I've had in Vegas. Really superb.

We were just ambling through Mandalay Bay and figured, what the hell. The food's great, the room is elegant, and the wine tower is a hoot--especially when the sommelier uses a rope belay to Mission: Impossible her way up to a bottle and back again.  Oh, and their wine list is on a touch tablet so you feel like George Jetson ordering a glass. 

Did. Not. Disappoint. 

Go!I love this restaurant! Came here for the tasting menue. They have the best tasty spring rolls, foie gras, etc. The best I would say is their wonderful service and dessert!   Their sorbets are to die for. Very fresh, delicious, and so many choices!  I went there for a special occasion and they provided excellent service. When they learned of my special event celebration, they even provided additional sorbets for tasting. Love love love the service here. Will definitely recommend :)"This is not fucking Apple Bee's!"  This was the first thing the waiter told us.  My first thought...this is my kind of place.  I love Dick's Last Resort.  Ribs and Wings were fantastic.  If you want service with a smile, respect and fun, go to Circus Circus.  If you want to be rowdy, eat ribs and drink beer, come to Dicks.Tried Earl of Sandwich this past weekend because my cousin recommended for me and her sis to try it since we were in Vegas for the weekend. I had the holiday special which was one of the best sandwiches I've ever tried in my life. It consisted of turkey, stuffing, and cranberries- If I can recall. I wanted to try the original 1762 but I asked one of the workers which one he would recommend, he suggested the holiday special. I feel like I wanna try every sandwich on the menu because it's THAT good. The bread is toasted so perfectly. HAHA.Here's a math question for everyone. 

If I was in Vegas for 3 days and went to Earl of Sandwich 3 times, how many sandwiches did I eat? 

A. 3
B. 4
C. This question can not be solved.
D. A & C
E. B & C

Brings back painful memories of the SATs, huh? 

The correct answer is E! Yes, this question is totally ambiguous but, it's also true that I ate 4 sandwiches in 3 visits. And as icing on the cake, I had a bite of my friends Tuna Melt. I've had half the sandwiches on their menu and I've never had one I didn't like. It's an addiction and really the BIGGEST reason I would continually stay at PH Towers. And at $6.48 (tax included) a pop, you can save the money, eat like a king or queen, and then blow your new found savings on Wheel of Fortune. 

But seriously, these are the best sandwiches I've ever had in my entire existence on Earth. Period.#1 sandwich palce !!! if you like hot sandwiches, very affordable and filling, the bread its toasted
lightly, and just crunchy enough on the outside & soft on the inside. They have a set menu for the
different ingredients in your sandwich, & I would recommend the full montagu, comes with roast beef,
turkey & vegetables in a nice cream mustard sauce !!

Oh & if you happen to be here around thanksgiving & xmas, get the holiday sandwich, its like having
turkey left overs with all the goodness inside !I'm not a big sandwich fan, but my friends wanted to eat here so I gave it a shot (being super hungry helped too).

We ordered the Earl's Club and were told that the wait would be about 40 minutes long. We were able to find seats and before we knew it our sandwiches were ready. The bread was toasty to perfection, the ratio between meat and veggies was perfect and their sauce and cheese complimented the sandwich very well. I tried using the mustard they provided, but I realized after a few horrible bites that their mustard really overpowers the taste of the sandwich. I opted to eat my 2nd half of the Earl's Club plain and it was muuchhh yummier left alone.


The second day I was starving again so I ran over to Earl's to grab a sandwich again. This time we ordered the Full Montagu and it was definitely a great sandwich. Unlike the Earl's Club which was a bit salty, the Full Montagu was much more balanced in terms of flavoring and it was seriously a great delight. I'd definitely recommend getting the Full Montagu and dripping on some of the Tabasco sauce they have at the tables. I'm literally drooling as I write this review thinking about these sandwiches.


Overall, Earl's was definitely worth the visits and at 5.99 per sandwich, you can't really go wrong. The service is pretty fast considering how many people there are waiting for food. This place is how ALL sandwiches should taste! Swing by if you're around the area by Planet Hollywood!!!it was so good that i went there 3 times and i was only in vegas for 4 and half days!Even though there are 1,000+ reviews I'll still put my 2 cents in. After partying it up at Wet Republic we were starving. Since Earl of Sandwich is on the way back to the hotel we decided to stop by to get our grub on. I swear the walk from the MGM grand was the longestttt...we should have just taken a cab. When we got there the place was packed and there was a line, but it moved quickly. I ordered the full montague and macaroni salad. About 5 minutes later my sandwich was ready. Yes I was highly intoxicated, but the sandwich was amazing. It would have been just as good if I was sober too. That was also my cheapest meal in Vegas. Now that was my 2 cents.I think this is probably the best sandwich I had in my life. The original roast beef is so  good. How come there are no Earl of Sandwiches in California???!!! Someone should definitely open one up already.The sandwichs are BOMB! I was there when it was kind of busy so I waited a bit for my sandwich. I got the Carribean jerk which was so tastey, this place totally lives up to the rave you hear about their food. It's a perfect & affordable vegas food! What better hotel for it to be in than Planet Hollywood!Good quality sandwich
Price around $7 
Very freshAltF ROCKS!! Unparalleled in photography industry! John Michael and Dalisa Cooper are phenomenal. They are amazing people with true talent and we are now honored to call them our friends. You will never get pictures like these from any other photographer. Truly unique and inspiring!I'm updating my review for 2 reasons: A) Emily. She is not unique in her attitude and sunny disposition, as all employees at this venue are _breathing_  happiness and joy and ExtraGoodGoodKarma (tm). And B) Consistent decent quality and decent price.

Plus, Fat Tire on tap.

The anchoring factor of 5 stars: perfectly-cooked flavorful sexy hunka cow. Great, wonderful staff. Decent price and consistent quality.My trips to the vet in the past have been detrimental for both Toby and I.  My little feline buddy would curse me for days after shoving him in a hard plastic carrier for the 45 minute (perhaps Christy L and I were making the EXACT same trip before) roadie to the vet.  He would scream and pee and freak out and I would do just about the same.  By the time we got back home it felt like we were never be friends again.  

Enter Scottsdale Cat Clinic.  

Our 6 minute jaunt to the doc was still filled with the regular car-indused mania but  knowing we were just blocks from our destination made things much easier.  When we arrived, our very patient and loving vet-tech Katrina cradled my little freak-out king, talking softly and calmly, and Toby took to her right away.  They cleaned him up (6 minutes is sure as shit still time to wet yourself!) and made him feel comfortable.  They werent at all nervous or annoyed when he started hissing a bit later at a needle, or when he scoffed at their treat bribes to sit still on the scale.  

The office was clean and modern and the staff, everyone from the receptionist to the Dr was polite, organized and intelligent.  Usually vet offices are chaotic frenzy but this felt more like I was walking into a pet spa.  I love that this office specializes in cats only as well.  

Toby just needed an annual check up, a rabies shot and a new diet for his extra summer weight so we were in and out in no time.  The office even called us the very next day to check in on us and be sure he had handled the whole trip just fine.  

To me, a good vet is hard to find, and as important as a good doctor.  I will never take my cat anywhere else!I live in this neighborhood, and regularly do my workouts around the loop. It is 2 miles, and filled with gorgeous homes, and views of the mountains. It is perfect for interval training, or just a nice stroll. It is a neighborhood so be respectful.I have come many times and the food and service is always outstanding!  I love the lunch specials, but dinner is also a great deal.  I treated my dad who came from out of town and I love when I get to order for people!  We had the jack scallops and jack beef.  There is a Monday special - order a beverage with entree and get a % off depending on if it is alcoholic or not.  They always give coupons.  Drinks are free with lunch (even beer!)  I love the matcha green iced tea!

The scallops are high quality so they can be eaten raw or cooked.  Unlimited veggies include napa cabbages, tofu noodle (shirataki - you can buy these at whole foods if you want to make them at home - just boil and dip!), tofu, carrots, bamboo shoots, snow peas, green onions!  Then you get a small thing of shredded daikon and chopped scallions (my fave) to add to sauces or just eat, plus unlimited salad and steamed rice and the dipping sauces.  I LOVE the spicy sauce - the waitress showed me how it is made so I can make it at home.  I drank it all!  Also love the sesame peanut and ponzu of course.
The service is attentive and the waitress skims the fat off the top of the water and refills drinks constantly.  Ice cream is ALWAYS on the house - get it with matcha powder!!!  A great deal, very healthy, cooking food in spring water and no oil!!!  My dad is diabetic so it was great and very filling.  I will definitely be back...we need to keep this place open!  Very nice decor too - my dad noticed.SWISH SWISH!!

So close to me, and this is the first trying it, I am upset with myself. So, my review probably sounds like the rest on here... but... power by numbers!!

The waitress was running the whole place by herself and I never felt left alone. She had no problem suggesting what my friend and I to get, nor had a problem teaching us the way of Shabu-Shabu (we had to ask the obvious of what it meant, yes.. it means swish swish ;]). 

For $28 it was a seemingly unlimited meal (excluding meats): salad, vegetables, noodles, tofu, and broth. Because we split the selection we had a $6 split charge, but that was no biggie to me. You are getting so much food, it only seems fair.

I recommend getting the split pot of Shabu Shabu and Sukiyaki broth. With the Shabu broth you get 3 dipping sauces ponzu, peanut, and a spicy sauce. With the Sukiyaki you get just the broth which has a Teriyaki flavor. Next time, I believe I will again get a split pot because the sauces were yummy and the Sukiyaki broth was good on its own..

I can't wait to come back and gorge myself on broth and veggies:]
... and then get some "on the house" ice cream.Biased because i'm the biggest beatles fan but it is amazingly done, unforgettable lights, artistry and of course remastered music.  I'll cherish this moment my whole life!If any show should be on a person's bucket list, this should be it.  Because the ticket prices are at the high-end, I could only afford seats in section 208 but I recommend booking the upper level.  Much of the show takes place above the audience so our seats were perfect.  Even one part of the show involves the whole audience and our seats again provided a superior vantage point.  

So a couple of thoughts to help you if considering this show.  It is not a Beatles tribute with acrobatics.  It is a Cirque Du Soleil show set to the Beatles music.  The difference?  The performers are still the focal point (vs. the Michael Jackson show which was a tribute to MJ performed by Cirque Du Soleil). 

Second, for this show it is as if they have taken movie special-effects and brought them to a live audience (in terms of the sets, scene changes, choreography).  It is jaw dropping. 

Third,  the athleticism of the performers is remarkable and yet understated as it is used to advanced the show's theme.  

In sum, WOW.I heard that they make really good noodles, and I have to agree. Plus, all their noodle dishes are under $9. I'm not surprised that they get really long lines every night.The price of food is good , the service girls are very nice , she is helpful. We are enjoy the food from yunnan garden !the service here is amazing and the palmer omg i just cant get enough of that its soooo creamy and delish! the food is amazing and the plates are just huge!
good pricing too
this place was on man vs food
great showPlayed back to back days this weekend. The course is great but the weather was horrible Cold, rain, wind. 

Every hole has character. The black sand was a first for me. It kind of trips you out at first.
If your in Vegas, you wont regret playing here.If you like it hot and spicy this is the place to start your quest.  After hearing tales about the food , I got to try it out for myself on a visit this past week.  I wasn't disappointed nor was the heat from the menu an exaggeration.  Very very tasty.  Be that as it may if you want a meek or mild meal you won't find it.  This is the kind of Mexican food for people who know the real deal and aren't afraid of it.  I loved the atmosphere, colors abound and are delightfully light and cheerful.  I went with two regulars to the place so I'm not sure if that had any effect on the service or not, but even during a busy weekday lunch hour they managed to give us our due attention.  The portion size was generous so that I we each had enough for another meal to go.  Will I be back? oh yes! you bet I will.  It gets my recommendation and a great rating for authentic Mexican food this side of the boarder.  The one and only odd thing I found, was that they don't do separate checks at a table. I have no idea why? but come on folks that's not even a real issue now is it.First off we got an incredible deal for our stay although it wasn't cheap. 

Perfect service. All the best restaurants are here and the casino is one of the best. 

Loved the marble bathroom. 

Gorgeous waterfall display.Wait, what?  Winter is over?  I....didn't even know it had come.

Winters in Michigan are spawned by the devil himself.  They are demonic devices used to torture people on the east side of the country, for whatever reason.  

Why would such a thing as frozen car door handles even exist?  Who does that to people?  The devil, that's who.

Where does 'Black Ice' come from?  That's not even a normal type of ice.  Only the devil can conjure up something like that.

And what about freezing windshields?  Huh?  Who freezes the windshield...INSIDE OF THE FREAKIN' CAR?!?!?!  

THE DEVIL, THAT'S WHO!!!!

Seriously, the winters here make the blistering summers an afterthought.  This is as close to paradise as is possible on Earth.  I couldn't believe that I was able to give away my winter coat for good.  

Hoodies as coats.  No need for Lugz boots.  Thermal underwear shouldn't even be sold here.My family and I always go to the Pappadeaux in Albuquerque so when we saw this one off the freeway we knew we HAD to stop for dinner.

We had a big group when we went but it really wasn't a problem for this place because it's such a large restaurant. The menu is extensive and heavy on the seafood which is awesome since it is delicious! We always get the fried alligator appetizer which is SO GOOD! I know it sounds gross but where the heck are you ever going to find ALLIGATOR?! Try it, especially with the sauce... YEAH! We have also tried the oysters on the half shell (great) and the fried oysters with fries (yum!)

For dinner I like to get the pasta mardi gras which is linguine with shrimp and sausage in a creamy marinara sauce. It has a bit of a kick to it which I like but the portion is really big so it's best to share. Crawfish etouffee is great and is a favorite of my dad. We have had the king crab as well which is yummy but can be hard to crack the shells and take apart. The filet mignon oscar was good but a little light on the crab meat that is on top of the steak. 

This place can get quite loud so be careful! Also can be a bit pricey but I believe the cost is less if you go for lunch.first things first,

the CORRECT address for this location is 3355 W. Spring Mountain Rd. suite #5 las vegas, NV 89102.

on to the review:

these ladies are AMAZING!!!... they are helpful and kind. They really care about making your day amazing and stress free. they pressed my dress on short notice, delivered to my hotel 2 hours before they're original given time and charged me at LEAST $50 LESS than any other dry cleaners!!!..... this was after 2 other shops told me they didnt have time to do it!!!... this is the best place for an out of town bride to get what they need..... please visit these ladies, they will make your day special!!Very good prices and open 24hours!  Awesome gas prices too!I'm new to Bountiful Baskets, and I wasn't sure what to expect.  I signed up for the Chandler location at Val Vista and Williamsfield.  There was a huge line when I arrived right on time!  People came armed with laundry baskets and canvas bags.  Some people brought their pets and children.  I came empty-handed (didn't know better!) and someone offered me an empty box (used for lemons) to carry my fruit and veggies home.  Wow!  It must have been 30lbs. of fruit and vegetables!  We got cauilflower, onions, broccoli, lettuce, spinach, carrots, melons, apples, red potatoes, lemons, oranges and two bunches of bananas!  I washed everything and inspected each piece, and everything is of excellent quality; nothing had to be discarded.  I like that!  I like the variety too!  And I like the mystery/surprise factor.  I know I'm going to get my daily fruits and veggies for the rest of the month!!Honestly some of the best food I have had in a long time.  My husband and I eat out a lot, but as people often do, we get stuck going to the same places.  So this time we tried the Roka, it was delicious.  I am not a huge connoisseur of Sushi or Japanese dining overall, but if you're new, they help you choose some of their signature dishes and your old favorites are to die for. 

We were able to get out of there for just over $100...but we drank a lot of wine, so that helped our bill push the $100 mark :)Had the tasting menu for two. The food and service were great. White chocolate brownie for dessert. Amazing.The funniest comedy show I've seen. 
I had tears out of laughter. 
He loves to pick on the audience and
Mix it with his improv talent.Thank you sweet tiny six pound infant baby Jesus! I have been on the hunt for a great sushi spot ever since a horrible experience at my previous spot. Oyshi did not disappoint today. the AYCE menu is extensive. The only bad thing I have to say about Oyshi is the music selection, you will need glow sticks to enjoy it.Just wanted to take some time to say how much I love everything about this place.  Their fish, meat and produce are all simply amazing.  The staff is always SO friendly and theres always tons of testers (yum).
Best salad bar in the valley, hands down.  Their prepared foods are really nice as well.  The cheese dept totally rocks, I especially love the little bin w/ small pieces of reasonably priced cheese, I usually grab one or two pieces of something I've never tried when I go.
Keep it up Whole Foods!Bowling in Vegas? Yep. My friend and I were stumbling around the Gold Coast Casino at midnight and chanced upon the largest bowling alley either of us had ever seen. It's 70 lanes. Let me say that again, 70 lanes. It's literally so big that if it were in Los Angeles you wouldn't be able to see from one end to the other due to smog. Not only was it big, it was cheap as hell. 2 drunk guys + 2 pairs of rental shoes + 2 games = $6. What happened in Vegas isn't staying in Vegas--I whipped his ass in both games, Nerd-Style!Great spot!!! Not fancy just really good food and terrific service. Greek gyro salad is fantastic but so is everything else.
Don't let the outside of the place deter you, it's worth your time to come in!Best in town by far.One of the best meals I have ever had! The atmosphere of the small cafe was playful and happy- music was great, and the service was excellent. Our waitress was sweet, knowledgeable and clearly a professional at what she does- Seriously a great server (I have 6 years in the service industry, I've seen all ends of the spectrum... She was great!) 
We has the fried yucca and patakones for appetizer- both were awesome- I preferred the latter- great flavors and doused with mango man sauce! My brother in- law got a mango smoothie, it was like drinking pure mango, nothing artificial tasting.
For a entree I had the special, black chicken, roasted for 19hours. It was so tender and delicious, I rarely get chicken for a meal and this was so great.  
Chocolate rum cake for dessert sealed the deal. One of my top 5 meals ever!I went for a haircut and Rachel did my hair. She was really nice and careful, and made my hair look fabulous!! I really appreciated that she walked me through the things she was doing with my hair, bangs, layers--not many stylists do that :) I can come back to get my bangs trimmed.

I really enjoyed my visit to Scissors Rox Paper. They were friendly and very professional. They are located on the south side of Cactus Rd, on the side of the Paradise Valley mall where Borders and Mary Callendar's are.I would have to say this is probably the best way you can spend a nice afternoon. 

there's a lot of fun games and the landscape is beautiful. 
if you're looking for a place to go on a date, this is it!!!

it's way cute!!

after coming here once, i thought it was so pretty, i decided to do my photo project here. 

there's a lot to learn here. if you're into the whole saving the environment thing, you'll LOVE it. 
i think its definitely worth paying to get into the different buildings.Undoubtedly one of the nicer areas of Vegas, exploring Springs Preserve makes you feel like you are not in Vegas.  

"But why would you want to do that", I hear you ask.  Sometimes, you just need to get away from the casinos, and the oranges, grays and browns of the desert.

It's great for taking a walk in, or getting ideas for your garden.  There are a lot of things to see and look at, and their recent additions are some of the nicest museum-style fare that we have in the city.  The state museum moves here recently, but with all the budget cutbacks, who knows when that section is ever going to open?  It's really sad, as what they have in place looks excellent.  Someone really took the time to figure out what makes for good design, and what would be really visually appealing.

There's also a lot of events that take place throughout the year, giving reason to come back more than once.  They also have a really nice gift shop (too many useful gardening books), and a Wolfgang Puck Cafe.  The staff that I've encountered in all aspects have been nothing but nice and helpful.

Of all the places like this in Vegas, this feels to be one of the most "complete", like it belongs in a big city.  It also does a nice job of catering to both tourists and locals, which is something more places around the city could stand to do.

If you have an afternoon to kill (not one of the batmess hot afternoons, however), this place is worth the visit.  It's pretty to walk around, interesting, and a nice change of pace for someone who wants a little more from their entertainment than what the casinos offer.One year later, 100¢ more...

Can anyone really be upset about the famous 99¢ shrimp cocktail going up to $1.99?  It's still a very tasty, light meal for only 2 bucks.  Other than the obvious reason for raising the price, let's look at the other reasons they needed to raise the price.

Kids today don't even know what a "¢" symbol is. It might as well be an early Egyptian hieroglyph.  The Egyptians aren't known for shrimp cocktails.

The "¢" is not on keyboards or smartphones.  I need to track all my Las Vegas activities on Facebook, in case of an alcohol related blackout.  What would I think if I missed a decimal and awoke the next morning thinking I ate a $99 shrimp cocktail?

99¢ shrimp cocktail just *sounds* cool.  The San Francisco Shrimp Bar and Deli isn't that cool.  Sure it's old-school downtown, but now they have dancing girls in the blackjack pit with loud music.  Beer isn't served in the deli anymore either.  Simply not cool.  Why stick with a price that makes you think differently?

Sooner or later, people were going to question where all these 99¢ shrimps were coming from.  It's the middle of the desert!  Tell me, how do they get here so cheaply, and can I car pool with them to save a buck?

They could easily sell this stuff for $6 on the strip, or $4 downtown.  It's really good.  It just isn't as cool or as exciting when you know the next time you review the place, you won't be able to use the ¢ sign in every paragraph.YUMMY!!!  This was my first time trying Forefathers and definitely won't be my last.  I ordered the regular steak philly with Cheese Whiz and although I will now have to up my workout tomorrow, it was worth it.  I loved that the sides were available to add as you like (the peppers)..great idea.   I also loved the sweet potato fries with fry sauce.  Love, love, love.  
Thanks Tony!  Great place you have here.Looking for the best salad around?  Try Donna's Summer Salad at The Painted Horse.  It has assorted greens, gorgonzola, mixed berries, toasted walnuts, raspberry vinaigrette and bits of chicken white meat.  It's great for lunch and it's a nice side at dinner.

I order it as the "Donna Summer Disco Salad," which went over my young server's head recently, LOL!It is nice to talk with someone who is passionate about what they do and presents only the best to the public. Out to provide a frozen yogurt option that is more  healthy and excludes all the artificial preservatives that other places supplement into their products, Red Mango is tarter and lighter than its competitors. 

I had eaten a plate of Vietnamese broken rice at home before going to met a friend, but still felt like getting something sweet. I settled on the Mixed Berry Parfait. The owner shocked me when she was making it because she started with a heaping scoopful of strawberries, followed by my choice of frozen yogurt, a sprinkling of granola, tons of fresh blueberries, even more strawberries, banana slices, more yogurt and then topped with more granola. This generous portion cost me $4.86 or something. I usually avoid heavy fillers at the stores that weigh by the ounce because it would cost me an arm and a leg for something jammed pack with fruits. Not here, their benevolent attitude towards giving you your moneys worth is almost unheard of now a days. Their granola, for instances, is not the cheap, sugar clumped, overtly sweet saboteur that is commonly placed in topping bars. The loose grains, pumpkin, and flax seeds are packed with nutritional goodness. Th best part was that my parfait was only around 280 for all that. Red Mango is another place that list caloric values.

If you possess any allergens, come leaf through the booklet that they have sitting on the table. All the ingredients are listed out in there. For those who have a soy allergy, the only flavor that is off limits are their chocolate based ones.Giddy up boys and girls!

This is a fun, casual evening spot to grab drinks (& food) with your friends. From hanging out at the bar, the spacious patio with stone fire pit, or at any of the oversized wooden tables... you will recieve prompt and friendly service.  Drinks are well poured. Had a few too many drinks and want to ride the bull? It makes for great entertainment for those like me who love people watching anyways.

This place is definitely a 'high energy, rock-western experience'.

*please note, this is a review of Saddle Ranch as a spot to hang out, the food has not been tested by yours truley*My friend got a 2 for 1 entree coupon walking down the street and we happened to stumble upon this place.  It is located in the Miracle Mile Shops.   The decor was were modern and chic!  It actually looks like it would have a dress code but it does not.  It is actually upscale looking but very casual environment.  The waitresses rock the skimpiest bikini tops and sarongs without and exposed booty cheek.  All of the waitresses have the bodies to wear it!  
Our waitress was training another HTZ girl and the service was excellent.  The drinks we ordered we soooooooo good.  Too bad I forgot what it was.  It was one of the best drinks I've had in a long time.  I ordered the chicken over mashed potatoes with seasonal veggies and my friend ordered the salmon. (pictures are located in the gallery)
 BOTH ENTREES WERE SUPERB!  OUTSTANDING!  OFF THE DAMN CHAIN!  I WAS SO SURPRISED! This place is such a hidden gem!  MY ONLY COMPLAINT IS THAT 18 PERCENT GRATUITY WAS AUTOMATICALLY ADDED!  However, every thing else was soo damn good, I got over it real fast!    There was a bachelor party there and one of them fell, and we all fell out laughing!  

Great Service, FANTASTIC FOOD, good drinks...kinda pricey...worth every penny!  This place is a gem!!!  LOVED EVERY FRIGGIN' SECOND!


I will be going back again!Came in over the weekend for a late lunch & we got seated right away.  I tried the king crab salad which was delicious as well as the Hawaiian Roll which was also great.  My friend ordered one of the combos which came with A LOT of food for about $16 & looked great.  I would definitely come back if I was in the area.Been coming hear for years and I can honestly say this offers the BEST lunch deal in Madison. The Sake Cod is so affordable for what they give you, I am amazed they offer this perfect piece of fish for $10. However, it's hard to pass on their awesome sushi. They do it all very well.So fattening. SO unhealthy. SO DELICIOUS! It was worth the drive from LA to AZ.I am a regular here at PINK POLISH I go for mani/pedi ' s about every two weeks as well as my daughter. Both of us are very picky and we LOVE this place.i have had several different nail tech ' s both have become especially partial to Kathy, who is super talented, creative and sweet. She remembers not only myself and my daughter buy also the things we've previously spoken about, so I'm not just a number there. The owner Tammy is friendly, welcoming and willing to go the extra mile for me, she also remembers my name and has taken me for a gel polish when they were only open for another 20 minutes without a problem. Another time i tried platform pointy nails and two days later came in to have them changed as they weren't for me, she only charged me for a polish change. The decor is top notch,modern and luxurious.
I won't be going anywhere else! Go check them out u won't be disappointed.I've died and gone to alkie heaven.

I walked in & got giddy like an 8 year old at a Hannah Montana concert.  It's basically a grocery store for wine, beer & booze.  Unlike BevMo, my local fav, which is a couple aisles of wine & a decent beer selection, this is aisle after aisle after aisle of fermented grapey goodness (I think their selection of just French wines is bigger than all of BevMo's cumulative wine stock).  

I found some great Spanish Riojas, a Greek Roditis, some great South American Malbecs, and a few more run-of-the-mill, yet still excellent, Zins & Shirazes (Shirii?  Shirazus?).   Their staff is knowledgeable and ever-present, so, just in case you miss their staff picks, you can track down someone to give you a pointer.  

I think I ended up with 8 quality bottles for something like $90.  

Their beer selection, sadly, isn't as huge as their wine selection, but it still includes all the favs for less than normal prices (Rogue Dead Guy was something like $7.50 for a 6 pack).  

I was gonna check out the booze selection, but figured I'd save it for another trip before I passed out.My review of the Side Door is way overdue. This is my go-to neighborhood spot when I feel like a sandwich and a beer. Or just a sandwich. Or just a beer. The Side Door shares a kitchen with Uncle Sal's, so you know the food is going to be solid. 
They have a great Mediterranean chicken sandwich, Stella, Peroni, 1554 and root beer on draft, and even have ice cream.
Equally equipped for dinner or lunch, as their wine selection is fairly extensive too.This place will be your new go-to neighborhood spot. Their grilled wings are absolutely to die for; perfectly crisp outside, juicy and tender chicken. 

A whole carafe of wine is $10 so you can enjoy a low key night for pretty cheap. Try their braised spare rib ravioli... Holy heaven.Love this place! Great sushi and Korean. Although I mostly go for the sushiThis place rocked...From the blood orange margaritas, to the beef cheek (what cheek I wonder).  Finished off with a Filet.  It was pretty expensive, $100 for one person.  But I was in vegas and on the company dime..why not..

Check this place out.  Designed really well and great bartenders.Great food, really cool people, and plenty of neat stuff to look at in the shop while you eat. Loved it!Great food and great service! My favorite restaurant hands down! The specials (lunch and dinner) are super inexpensive and big enough that two people could share, but you will want your own for left overs. Yum, yum!How have I never reviewed my favorite movie theater in the valley yet?!  My husband and I are ultra movie buffs and go to the movies often.  I despise AMC theaters out here, because I swear to you, their seats are super uncomfortable vs. Harkins (I have a bad back, so I'm a bit picky).  We don't like the UltraStar in Surprise because it is a bit cramped.  

Not only is Harkins a local theatre...and I feel great about supporting it each time we go, but...stick with me here...they are the only theatre that has the popcorn flavor toppers!!  I never used to eat movie theatre popcorn and chose candy instead.  But there's no way I can go without getting popcorn so I can cover it with the white cheddar flavor...but I digress.  I'm supposed to be reviewing the Park West location.

We used to go to the Palm Pavilion theatre off of the 101 and McDowell, but it is OVERRUN by teenagers at all hours of the day (except maybe the first showing of the day).  The parking there is a bit of a pain in the rear.  So, we stumbled upon Park West when it first opened and never hesitate to go there first.  Even on opening night, the theater isn't as packed with teenagers and unruly kids.  We do tend to go on Saturday or Sunday mornings and still avoid evening shows.  The other day we went to the very first showing at 9:55 and it was glorious to have the parking lot and the theater almost all to ourselves!  

I almost hate advertising these things I love about PW because I don't want too many people realizing it is so fantastic.  As long as the unruly teenagers and kids stay away, I'll be totally cool with that!I have been to a lot of Whole Foods stores all over the country and this is, by far, the nicest Whole Foods EVER in the history of Whole Foods.  If you can show me one better, then I'll go there and check it out.

I travel a lot for work and when I travel, I usually try to hit up a Whole Foods or anything similar so I can get my salad, sushi, fruit, sparkling water or whatever is healthy so I don't gain 20 million pounds on the road.  I do end up spending more (that's why I like to call Whole Foods "Whole Paycheck") but I think I'm healthier for it.

This Whole Foods in Scottsdale is AMAZING -- they sell clothes!  They have a sit down wine and tapas bar.  They have a taqueria.  Granted, I didn't get a chance to really eat anything other than the salad bar (which is HUGE, by the way), but it was incredible.

If you ever are in the area, you should go just to see how the other half live.  There isn't another Whole Foods like this anywhere (if there is, please tell me where and please tell me it's in Atlanta).  I can never go back to my little old regular Whole Foods ever again (just kidding).Better than a real volcano! I had the pleasure of watching from my room as usual . 
best man made volcano I have ever seen .When I imagine Heaven, I think of eating Wagyu beef all the time.

Cut is heaven on earth.

I went there on a Thursday at 6pm and it was really easy to get a table.

I ordered the (American) Kobe sashimi and the Taste of  New York which is 4oz. Nebraska corn-fed dry aged angus, 4oz. American Kobe, and 2oz. Japanese Wagyu beef.

The sashimi was dressed in olive oil, soy and ginger, and it was decadent.  I'm so glad that I followed it with the sampler rather than one type of beef.  It really allowed me to experience a wide range of cow goodness.  

I thought that the service was knowledgeable and yeah, they're pushy.  Just push back.Having just recently been to Japan, I was excited to see wagyu/kobe beef being offered.  My fiance raved about this place so I thought I'd give it a try.   I made reservations a week ahead for 8 PM on a Friday night.  

The atmosphere and decor of the restaurant is modern.  The menu isn't cheap,  the steaks avg from $60 - $200.   I ordered the Rib Eye Wagyu/Kobe beef which was $85.   For the side items, we ordered mac and cheese, potatoes, and spinach.   It took awhile for the food to come out, so we loaded up on the breadsticks and bread they are complimentary.  

Out came the steaks..  It was cooked beautifully.  It was seared and cooked to a perfect medium rare.  I got the sauce from Argentina and this complimented the steak very well  It was a perfect amount of food, and the hightlight of the evening.  

I will recommend to all!This place is so fancy it's almost uncomfortable haha. However, this restaurant has the best food , in my opinion, that I have ever tasted. The service is impeccable.the appetizers are really good. I really enjoyed the tuna tar tar. The Japanese wagu steak is just out of this world. The flavor just explodes in your mouth and melts in your mouth! The purée mashed potatoes are insane. I have been here countless times now and there really isn't anything on the menu that is bad. Favorite restaurant of all time.I loved it!! My first time there and the staff is great very friendly...got the wings 8 with soda and great fries!!! The street tacos are$1 and yummy as well wilk be going back!!Perfection at the Madison locale.  A humorous and attentive server named Jung made it an enjoyable Saturday evening for a party of four.  My brother, a butcher of 40 years, said it was the best cowboy rib eye steak he had ever had.  I would concour, perfectly cooked to order and excessively large were the norm for the various cuts we ordered.  The house chopped salad was fresh tasting and each component stood out on their own.  The salad is topped with lightly deep fried onions that were crisp and not oily.  The potatoes au gratin were sizzling hot and while excellent, I would have preferred a sharper cheese in them and another minute under the salamader to brown the top, but they were fully cooked and piping hot.  The fresh Brussel sprouts were served in a bacon and honey sauce that was tasty and not over powering.  There was a very large portion of veg, but it let everyone share - even those who would normally turn their nose up at the thought of eating the little cabbages seemed to like them in the preparation presented!   A great dark red Zinfandel ($70) went well with the meal and after dinner drinks with creme brullee completed a leisurely dinner on a very busy Saturday night.  Lots of expediters and others helping the servers, so it was seamless, professional and still one of my favorite places to dine.  The usual extensive wine lists, choices of water and formal dining service.  Have eaten at a number of other of Ruth's locations and am consistently impressed with the high quality, professional service and reasonable pricing for such an evening of entertainment. Entrees and sides are priced separately, which adds up for those afraid to open their wallet, but when you consider that you spend $125 for four hours of entertainment that leaves you sated, it is well worth.  The perfect place for a very special evening out or to celebrate a special event.  Kudos to their fine staff for making a special evening even more special for friends who had never had the chance to sample the cusine at a Ruth's.  Parking is in a private lot.  There is no valet parking and it was difficult to find a spot to park at 6:30 pm.  Handicapp parking is non-existant, but staff were very accommodating to a wheelchair bound diner, an expediter even escorting them to the bathroom and initially to their table.  Easy to maneuver and spacious, despite being very crowded on a Saturday nightGreat buffet with just the right amount of selection for the stir fry section and finger foods. When I'm hungry all I want is a steaming plate of stir fry noodles and some of those crab puffs!I was at school (ASU) over by Mill Ave and I had this outrageous craving for a frozen smoothie or ice cream shake.  I Yelped for the nearest spot and headed over.  The yogurt spot that was supposed to be there was gone, but I found "Cookiez on Mill" instead.  What absolute luck!!

This place has Italian soda, ice cream shakes, cream soda, cookie shakes, and more!  Wait?  Did I just say "cookie shake?"  Yes I did! And it was fantastic!!  I had a butter pecan cookie shake with white chocolate chip almond cookie blended into it.  OMG, talk about a flavor explosion of buttery pecan goodness in my mouth, this cookie shake was awesome.

I will be back, many times, to feed my insatiable sweet tooth that now craves cookiez on mill.I graduated with a degree in Hotel Management, and one of my classes, Food and Beverage 101 had a case study on In-N-Out. Serious. And me, being a New Yorker, never had the pleasure of savoring one of these freshly made burgers... until a recent work trip to Vegas! 

Fo'reals, didn't know one existed in Vegas (if I had known, I would've been there every day vs just a few hours before my flight out!). 

Thanks Leah R. for the tip on the walk from Excalibur - it was literally only 15 minutes! And the walk made me work up my appetite. Good times! Leah R.'s directions: "Tip: you CAN walk here from the strip. Just walk down the sidewalk on the Excalibur side of the street across the freeway bridge entrance area and under another little bridge and you're there. It's like a 15 minute walk." 

Had my double-double animal style with a vanilla milkshake to wash it all down. Seriously, I have to say... it really was the best burger I've ever had. The melding of flavors was seriously awesome. And if I wasn't with a group of people... I could've thrown down another double-double, but didn't want to look too much like a pig! 

Seriously - go. And my $6 dinner was the cheapest meal I had during my entire trip in Vegas!Retro is WONDERFUL! Kari and Brian are so friendly and the cupcakes are AMAZING! We even had them for our wedding.Their cupcakes are usually my breakfast (I KNOW! they're that good!) LOVE LOVE LOVE RETRO!I've been to a few cupcake bakeries around the Valley and have to say this one is by far the best I've went to.  The pricing is very reasonable and the selection was great.  I got the cookies and milk cupcake and instantly feel in love.  It wasn't overly sweet like the other bakeries I've been to.  Definitely going back to try some other flavors.My first love in las Vegas. Yayo, call me when you start franchising! While i am typically a purist, i Love the taco fusion.Had great food. Now has a "CLOSED" sign on the door.  all the equipment is gone and all the surf boards.Oh Yard House....I'm so glad you have come into my life. Yard House has one of the best happy hours in Vegas. Love the location (in Town Square). Love the hours....especially the late night happy hour (perfect for after work get-togethers...which we do often). 
The beer list is awesome. I usually stick with the Sin City Lite, but occasionally get the Lindeman's Framboise. 
Great martinis too! Love the mangolicious and the malibu peach. The only one that I didn't like was the coco cabana. I felt badly sending it back because the server recommended it more then the one I really wanted..the vanilla cheesecake martini...which I still haven't tried to this day.....ahhh, next time.
The food is fantastic too....great selection of appetizers. Ok, I have never been here any other time then happy hour. I hear their dinners are good too, but man I can't pass up their onion rings and nachos! 
I always try to save room for dessert here too....the macadamia nut cheesecake is awesome!!! (Last time I went I tried a friend's warm homemade brownie...amazing!!!)
The patio is great if you can manage to get a seat out there...this place is always busy, but oh so great!Great food for the price. Just off The Strip. I have been here before and will be back. Large selection of craft beer (I had the Octoberfest today, very hoppy). After a full day of shopping we wanted comfort food. So both my wife and I ordered burgers. They were cooked to perfection. We had a side of fries that were julienned so they carried a lot of flavour and were extremely crispy. Can't wait to go back. Next time I am not driving so I can sample a couple of different beers.Big selection, reasonable prices.. I love buying in bulk because not only do you save, you get quality products. And it matters to get a good product for a good price.
I usually buy their produce and I love how it always tastes great!Hurray for Tomo!!!  I'm so glad that we found this place, as I live out west and was getting really sick of driving out to Scottsdale for decent sushi.  I absolutely love the ambiance of the place (on the inside, the outside is a nondescript strip mall, go figure), and the service is almost always top notch.  We've become regulars at the place, and our favorite waitress remembers our basic order, including that I can't have avocado in one of the rolls I order.  That, my friends, is a sign of a great server.

We usually go during Happy Hour, which is incredible.  The rolls are very nicely priced during this time (3-6pm every day), and any other time of the day they are priced how you would expect a sushi place to price their rolls.  I love their spicy tuna tartare, and I would also recommend their crazy roll.  If you go during non-happy hour, try the unagi.  It's great too (and decently priced).  Also, it's important to note that the size of the rolls is awesome - no skimping, and the perfect ratio of fish to rice.

If you're looking for a great sushi joint in the west valley, head on over to Tomo!!Always good, always friendly, always packed.

Always a good choice, the best 'fast food' spot in town.After a year of living with contractor flat paint, it was time to get the house painted.  We weren't sure who to call about this type of job for our home but we wanted to get a few estimates and a feel for the various companies. Jimmy was the one who visited our home for the initial estimate.  He was so great and professional! He brought in color samples, business license, reviews and more!  There was a huge binder filled with all of the information we needed about CertaPro.  

We obviously set up a date to have this done with them. I asked ahead of time how long it would take to paint.  They said 1 day maybe 2.  Fortunately it only took 1 to do our whole home! This included the walls and baseboards. Three painters arrived around 7:30am and were cleaned up and finished by 4:30.  Fantastic!  

Another great thing about the company is they use Sherwin Williams Paint.  Their paint has no VOC.  What is that? ( I had to ask too)  There aren't any harmful and toxic chemicals in their paint.  This is great not only for our health but since we have a dog, he was safe too.  Even during the paint process, we didn't have that strong paint smell the entire time. 

For Vegas homes, the textured walls are always a pain to get every crevice. Luckily they use a sprayer vs. rollers.  Using the sprayer probably made it go much quicker and I think a more even coat.  

I played a joke on one of the painters...  When he asked me how it looked, I answered 'OH MY... it's the wrong color!'   Luckily he had a great sense of humor and we both got a good laugh about it.  :-)  

I'd highly recommend them to anyone.  They did a fantastic job and I'm happy!Great Sushi! Good Happy Hour prices on food and drinks!

This place is great!  I have no idea why everyone crowds to Kona down the way, when this place is less crowded, has good food and the services has always been good. Also it is cheaper and has a better offering of sushi.

I would definitely go again!I'm terrified of heights, I cant stand them and I've been on 2 of the 3 rides. 

I've ridden the Big Shot about 5 times. The feeling of weightlessness at the top is awesome. But half of the appeal of this ride and it adds to the terror is that you don't feel like your strapped in properly. 

Insanity, I recently went on this. You have no choice but to look down, in fact attempted to look up makes it worst because you realize all thats preventing you from falling to your death is a crane like arm attached to a tower 1000 feet above the ground. I didn't scream but clutched for dear life and focused on the ground like it was some sort of special effect. 

You have the option of paying for tower admission + price of rides or paying for an unlimited wristband. Insanity and Big Shot are worth re riding if you have the guts to afterwards.Great Place - especially fridays and saturdays when they have live music - Great Beer, Wine and Food. We were delightfully impressed.we have been going to lucky pizza for over ten years.   best kept secret in surprise. meals are reasonable priced.  check out the chicken parmesan excellent.Like many of the high end casino restaurants, Brand is pricey but very good.  In my opinion, the Monte Carlo isn't the nicest of casinos and, to be honest, I had low expectations going to Brand especially after perusing the menu and prices beforehand.  I thought we were surely in for another overpriced Vegas meal.  We went to Brand because we had tickets to see Blue Man Group.  But, my wife and I were pleasantly surprised with the quality of the steak.  We also shared mushrooms and broccolini which were both tasty and not overcooked.  The wine was ok and the port was good as well.  But, the mark of a good steakhouse is the steak and the filet medium rare was melt-in-your-mouth good and deserving of 5 stars.  The service was professional, attentive, and courteous.Honestly a great rec center. They have an awesome gym, the prices are really good for family packs, and the parks surrounding the center are beautiful and well-maintained. 

My 4 year old daughter goes to Apples to Zebras preschool and Club Pee Wee as well. She loves her classes and they are actually helping her get ready for school. She has "homework" each week and loves going each day. I highly recommend this for parents wanting to prep their kiddos for school. Unlike the Chandler Community Center Apples to Zebras program, this one actually has a decent curriculum. Although, the other program is great as well if you are wanting a daycare type environment instead of preschool.

The staff is always friendly and knowledgeable and registering for classes online is super easy. 

If you haven't stopped by, go check it out!A FRESH NEW WAY TO EAT BURGERS!!!!

Who would have though that making burgers your own way was something new and fresh. It's not..... Burger King, has "Have it your way", In-n-Out have a hidden menu, but what were they missing? More options!!!! With many options for meat and vegetarian burgers, every topping I could think of and few I didn't think of, as well as around 42 sauces, this place is my new favorite place to go for good food, fast. I am in and out of this place with in 30 minutes. Make sure you grab a clip board fill out what you want and turn it in asap (especially during lunch rush). Then ask about the combo buy 10 and get one free card. Family owned and operated with a corporate look. Friendly employees. Caitlin & Megen, are chatter boxes so even if you are dining a lone you will have someone educated and enjoyable to talk to. I want to see an eating contests for the Man VS Food guy soon. I am thinking one pound Big Daddy Burger (not on the Menu and delicious), one pound hot dog, and a 3-topping masterpiece of frozen custard in 45 minutes. If they make it I will get the Man VS Food guy to come EAT!!!! Why eat fast food drive-thru when you can have healthy, great quality, food fast for about the same price.After going to Maru Korean BBQ for their new AYCE Sushi....I was absolutely flabbergasted!  Seriously! Limited sushi for AYCE is absurd! 

Xtreme Sushi, Thank you for not having limited items on your AYCE! You are my Xtreme ultimate favorite until I meet your match!

I love Xtreme!I have another 5 star experience with this store.  I had a problem with my Time Capsule.  I scheduled the appointment two days ago for this morning at 11:30.  A few minutes before the time, Goran came over and checked to see I was the person he was to help.

Within a few minutes, he had checked the soft reset I had done with my TC.  He entered some more information and I was up and running again in no time.

I have paid a premium for owning Apple items but it has always been worth it in ease of use, magnificent design, and support like this!  Bravo!  Thanks, Goran!Let me preface by saying I rarely give 5 stars. In fact this is only my second, but my first "real" one. The other was for a Yelp booth, and how can you not love Yelp staff?

I found myself at Fry's (yeah, they're still around) at Town Square with a new MacBook Pro power adapter in hand and ready to purchase. My previous one had come apart over the course of a week where the cable meets the adapter. (I read this is quite common, even with careful handling.) I got to wondering if they had a recycling program so I could avoid trashing my old adapter. On a whim I decided to call Apple while waiting for the next Fry representative to finish with a customer. The Apple rep said they can set me up with an appointment in 30 minutes and talk to the Genius Bar about recycling the item. Since the price at Fry's wasn't any less than Apple's for a new adapter I decided to meet with a Genius rep. Within five minutes of arriving for my appointment I met with the rep. She checked the serial number on my MBP (out of warranty by the way), entered some information on her iPad, and next thing I know I'm getting a new adapter in exchange for my old one. Hell yeah!



Info on the adapter replacement program: http://support.apple.com/kb/TS4127?viewlocale=en_US&locale=en_USThe staff here is incredible! such nice people and they are very helpful getting you through your practice. I swear my mind feels sharper every time I finish a class. My body, a bit dehydrated, but nothing a coconut water won't fix!We love this place.  We love it so much we eat there at least once a week.  Everything on the menu is good, and there is a wide variety of entrees.  The pizzas are around $10 and can easily feed two.  Salad portions are ample as well.  You really can't go wrong here.  The only downside is that it can get quite busy and can be difficult to find a seat.  That being said, it still doesn't deter us.Oh my gosh. Where do I begin? The humus was awesome. The main courses were all DELICIOUS. The atmosphere was inviting (the patio is to die for), and the service was incredible. There is an extensive wine list and a good selection of beer as well. The new owners have done a fantastic job. Hands down, this is one of our favorite places. It's a MUST!!!I had the opportunity to eat lunch at P.F. Changs Chinese Bistro yesterday (4/28).  I have been going there for several years and I liked it then, but the changes they have made are just great.  The employees there have always been nice, but it seems they really go out of their way to make you even more comfortable now.  When my waiter came to the table to take my order, he asked me if I wanted egg-drop soup or another kind.  I was so surprised because they have never offered soup as part of your meal beforehand and there was no extra charge for it.  They have also changed the way you get your entre.  They used to bring a bowl of white or brown rice for everyone to share and then your entre would be on another plate.  Now, at least for lunch, they call it a lunch bowl and everything is put on one plate.   You are not having to put each item on another plate yourself, like you used to.  Their food is delicious and I almost always get the Crispy Honey Chicken, which I love.  They have a large menu with many different dishes.  I highly suggest if you are looking for a fabulous Chinese Bistro, that you try P.F. Chang's.They make possibly the best burger on the planet....nuff said!I have been here several times for lunch and dinner. It has always been good This time  I had the semi serious burger, fries/ onion rings and iced tea. The burger was really good. Nice and juicy. I love that you have so many choice of toppings! Service was very good.In a city that is still discovering "personality", Cellblock is king. 

Cellblock is fun. It's crazy and dirty and sketchy and dark and sexy, but above all, it's fun. Everyone here is always having fun. 

For those of you who don't know it by reputation, Cellblock is "that" bar. The one that your perfectly-manicured friends warn you about. It's the Hoist, the Eagle, the Gauntlet, and the Mineshaft. The classic dirty gay leather bar. There is a cross and a cage, a boot-blacking chair and a sex shop. You do not order a pink martini. 

I've brought a few girls and straight friends here, and they loved it, and the other patrons loved them. Just use common sense. This isn't a hag bar, and the energy is definitely masculine. 

The bartenders are one of the greatest things about this place. They are incredibly, sincerely friendly. The drinks are the strongest of any bar I've ever been in anywhere, and the cheapest. 

The DJ is also incredible. I've never met him, but I wish I knew his (their?) name. 

Every night is a different promo. Beer busts, 50 cent pitchers, strippers, underwear, shirtless, gear. 

It's currently under construction, but Bill (the owner) and the bartenders are keeping us updated, and it plans to reopen.Love this place!  Great place to go safely hiking and get a workout.  But it is a trail where it is harder to come back - more uphill.  Most hikes you reach your peak and then it's all downhill from there.  Not this place :)  Great views!  Usually see Chuckwallas (lizards) and I just saw my first rattlesnake on this trail and I have probably hiked this trail 20 or more times.  If you are visiting Scottsdale, you must go, even if you just get to the peak, without heading over to the second mountain.  Fabulous!This was such an entertaining show - the man is extremely talented.

We lucked out in our timing, and got to go watch the show during his Christmas special.  Between the show, the voices, and the songs we were thoroughly pleased with our choice to go see him live.This has to be my favorite breakfast spot.  I love the crunchy edges of their pancakes.  Even when they are packed, the food quality is consistent.    I am a happy girl.Fred's Playland gives them two thumbs up. Great overall experience. Especially considering we brought them a bus load. That can be extremely challenging. The service was impeccable, The food was served quickly and it was delicious. I especially enjoyed the new Salmon Patties. They got us in and out and we were happy, full and on time. We look forward to visiting again next year on our annual Salt River Trip.

Last year we had a less than grand experience at The Cracker Barrel. They totally redeemed themselves on this visit

Good Job Cracker Barrel!Ok...so I know I have said this before, but this is legit.  

These are the best tacos in the valley...perhaps anywhere! It wouldn't have even happened had Fajardo's Cafe been open! We had driven out to Glendale and it was closed, so I jumped on Yelp and this place came up!  

It's a very small place and if I hadn't read Floyd C's review, I probably wouldn't have found it! (Thanks, Floyd!!!)  It is on the north east corner of 59th Ave and Camelback.  However, it is facing 59th avenue...yeah.  we drove around a few times...then read the review! Oh....gotta love random adventures leading to a diamond in the rough!

You go up to the counter, order...and they hand you a little plate to fill with all of the fixings they have at the salsa bar...which to be honest...they're all AMAZING!!!!  Plus, they have cucumbers, lettuce, onion/cilantro mix, carrots and limes! LIMES!! Remember...I have a lime fetish.  

***the ONLY complaint I have...and it is not even that big of a deal and I won't be taking any stars away is that they don't have cilantro alone...I hate raw onions. Like to the point of having a close to "ick" reaction! *** Anywhoooo...

I ordered 2 carne asada tacos and a lengua taco with a side of beans.

The lengua (tongue...yes tongue) is absolutely flavorful and SOOOOOOOOO tender!  The carne asada is probably the most flavorful I have ever had here in the valley!  The beans are amazing and super yummy...it seems to me that they have chorizo and cheese in them.  

The service is quick and not so personable, but not rude at all! They are busy and are pretty much just making sure to get everyone their orders!  We will be back! Every Tuesday! ;-)

Wanna know how much we enjoyed our meal?  We each ordered a carne asada burrito to go...for lunch tomorrow!  We never do that!  

So who is up for Taco Wednesday? Thursday? Any day that ends in "Y"??Went in today to get a gift card for my wife and info for myself on sports massage was immediately greeted by Vanessa and she took care of all of my questions and gave me the gift certificate. Looking forward for me soon and my wife's gift there. Hope massage service meets up to Vanessa's standards.Our family had a fantastic time last week at the Children's Museum of Phoenix.  It was our second visit to the museum in as many years, and it confirmed my prior opinion that this is one of the best children's museums anywhere.  

The challenge with this museum is that it gets very crowded and some of the interactive exhibits are optimized for the kids' enrichment and enjoyment rather than to facilitate the parents' supervision, which adds to the challenge of keeping a watchful eye on your little ones.  One the first level is "the Climber", where the kiddos walk, climb, crawl and explore several levels up in a complicated structure.  Museum staffers are well positioned to listen and watch for children who are upset or scared, but I had a difficult time tracking my kids' progress.  There are three places where the kids can exit, so a couple times my daughter left the structure and despite trying to track her I didn't know where she was.  Same with the Noodle Forest on the 3rd level - the kids enter the noodles and you can either try to follow or just cover the 60' +/- exit to make sure they don't get past.

Our kids loved everything - The Climber, Whoosh (the scarves zipping around the vacuum tubes), the floating ping pong balls with the PVC pipes next to Whoosh on the first floor, the car wash/pedal power on the 2nd floor, the Market and of course the Noodle Forest on the 3rd Floor.  Everything was great fun.

The physical plant also enhances the experience at the museum.  It is a great reuse of an historic school building.  I am a big believer that great spaces make an impression and a difference.  The building makes the museum even better.

Great experience.  Highly recommend.Huge fan of the bacon infused meatloaf and the what's in it steak! Make sure you get the tiramisu for dessert. 

Great ambiance in there. I bring friends and family in there whenever they're visiting from out of town. Solid restaurant to have in my repertoire. I'm pretty new to cooking but am very adventurous and have to say that Eddie's concoctions provide a lot of inspiration. He likes to take an unorthodox approach to his recipes....I think he refers to it as a melting pot of cultures approach. Pretty cool how Chef Eddie will come out and mingle with the patrons too. One complaint is that his menu is somewhat limited but get on his email list!!! Always sends out great specials (1/2 off entrees) and has different special menu items every Thursday, Friday, and Saturday night. 

FYI: Check out some of his cooking classes up at Sub Zero sometime too. Very good $30 investment considering you get a three course meal, commentary and instruction from Eddie, wine, 3 hours of entertainment, and you still get to take the recipes home with you!We have our new slice of Heaven!!!

They also deliver to our house which is even better.

After reading reviews on yelp the wife and I decided to check it out. Great little place very friendly people. We were escaping our inferno of an apartment, the ac was not performing up to our igloo like standards. So, we put a bunch of ice in the dogs water bowls and went off on our new yelp adventure.

Pizza A Metro was a great choice. They gave us tons of water to calm our sweltering hearts and served us amazing food.

To start a pizza crust cut up served with a cold onion bruschetta (the best i can describe) it was very good, but I could not eat a lot of it, however the wife loved it.

Salad: next we shared their least expensive salad, nice leafy spring mix with onions,  tomato's, and a tangy italian dressing (i would order it on the side in the future) Very good and was more then enough for both of us.

Entree: She had a Margherita pizza which she added olives to. She ordered the small and it will last her two lunches in leftovers. I was a bit surprised to see the olives cost an extra $1.50 but other than that she loved it, and I enjoyed it as well.
I had the home made Gnocchi, which were very good, and very filling. It comes with your choice of sauce, I ordered the four cheese sauce (how could you not) it was excellent, but if I had to do it again I would get a red sauce with it.

Please go there support them they are worth it. We have been searching for a pizza place in the downtown area, and I believe this is the champion!!!!Raku, quite simply, is my favorite Japanese restaurant in the world.  

Featuring a diverse menu of grilled, stewed, and cooked Japanese items, Raku features equally diverse price points for dining as well.  Order exclusively off the robata grill and stewed menu and you can easily eat for under $20/person.   Feel more adventurous and trusting of the chef at $45/person and you'll leave feeling full and satisfied while trying more exotic fare.  Or finally opt for a formal kaiseki menu (3 day advance order) and you'll have a divine Japanese food experience that will challenge any set menu you've probably ever had.  

No matter what price point you select, Raku's constant will be exceptionally prepared food.   People have called even the priciest meals here true bargains and it makes everything else simply a steal. 

The drink selection that pairs well with the food is equally diverse and just as price friendly.  Bottles of quality sake, Japanese beer, and cocktails range from amazingly under $10 to well north of $150.  Anyone can truly eat here and  if I lived closer I'd be having regular weekday meals, special celebratory meals, as well as any weekly meal I could sneak in. 

Some standouts from our most recent meal:

Foie Gras egg custard with smoked duck and black truffle - representing the clear high end, this dish utilizes almost every high priced ingredient in a chef's repertoire.  The flavor was divine as the Foie Gras custard was cooked perfectly and presented in a gorgeous empty egg shell.  The black truffle was a decadent, but much appreciated, addition. 

Kobe beef seared over hot rock with garlic - perfectly presented on a bed of hot rocks, the Kobe beef is seared to perfection.  The thinly sliced garlic adds the minimal flavoring needed. 

Daikon and beef tendon oden - the other end of the price spectrum and the most affordable items on the menu at $1.50 and $2 respectively.   Ultimate comfort food...perfectly sliced and tender beef tendon and stewed daikon radish served in a perfect broth complimented by a small wallop of Japanese mustard.  

Fresh oyster served with minced okra, seasoned scallions and uni - again the presentation was perfect as the oyster was shelled and delicately sliced before being placed back in the shell.  The fresh uni and seasoned scallions perfectly counteracted the brininess of the oyster. 

Overall, my meal at Raku was one I had looked forward to all year and it did not disappoint.   While we indulged for a special occasion, we still found amazing bargains in the oden stew and the extensive sake selection.  

Raku is truly a special restaurant and their dedication to top quality food is evident the moment you sit down and notice that every condiment (ie: salt, pepper, chili oil, soy sauce) is house made.   It only gets better from there. 

For those who love comparisons, I can attest for me that my meals here have been better than some of my favorite Japanese restaurants in the past, including, but not limited to: Gochi (Cupertino), Sumika (Los Altos), Nobu (HK), Momofuku (NYC), Morimoto (CA) and many more.  Yes, many of those places are great but I love Raku even more. I still can't believe it's in Vegas!

Raku accepts all credit cards, including American Express.After nearly 5 years away from Vegas, I was back. And as you can imagine, I had a handful of restaurants I had been dying to check out. Out of the five, only one lived up to the hype and will continue to see me whenever I'm in town. Can you guess which restaurant that was?

My wife and I made reservations a month out because we knew it would be difficult to get one if we had waited any longer. So that would be my first recommendation if you plan on coming here... reserve your spot as early as possible. During dinner, I saw a couple come in without a reservation and they were regrettably turned away. Don't let that happen to you.

My second recommendation would be to order the $100 Omakase option. Apparently the difference between this and the $75 option is the quality of the food; my opinion is, if you're going to eat a dinner of this caliber, why not spend $25 more to get the best?

As far as the food was concerned, I don't know what to tell you except: be prepared to be wowed. Granted, not all of the dishes were mind-blowing, but plenty of them were. Some of my favorites:

Hairy crab: I had never heard of this prior to my visit to Raku, and apparently they only exist in parts of Japan, but the meat was flavorful, and they pre-cut the shell so it's easy for you to scoop out the meat. And the vinegar-based dipping sauce that comes with it is absolutely perfect with the crab.

Sashimi: The tuna, paired with marinated seaweed, was awesome. And the uni was by far the best I've ever had. So rich, so creamy, so buttery... SO GOOD. My wife never had uni and refused to try it because of the way it looked and because she's a texture-eater, but I convinced her to try some, and she ended up liking it. Some day, she will love uni; I'm sure of it.

Bacon-wrapped mushrooms: So simple, yet so delicious. I love the texture of these mushrooms, and when combined with the bacon and a soy sauce-like sauce, it's seriously fantastic. I could pop these in my mouth all day long.

Salmon belly: The salmon was cooked so well (meaning not overcooked and dry), and the skin was perfectly crunchy and salty. Combine that with salmon roe in each bite, and you've got a magical blend of flavors and texture. Popping the roe in your mouth completed the dish so perfectly. Awesome.

Wagyu beef: This was served on a skewer, cooked to a perfect medium-rare, and topped lightly with wasabi. When I took my first bite, I was shocked at how tender it was... it melts in your mouth like butter. And the seasoning was just right. 

Each dish came out in a timely manner (although we got a little jammed w/ the crab since it took some time to scoop out all the meat), and the chef did a great job going from the lighter dishes to the richer, more filling ones. And our server, Kazue, was extremely friendly and did a great job explaining each dish to us.

Keep in mind the Omakase menu does change. There were a few items that my friends had told me about, but we didn't get them. I guess we'll just have to keep going back.Wow.  That's all there is to say, really.  I've been here 6 times now, and every time I leave just as impressed as the first.  Except this last time - I was stunned by how absolutely delicious and creative the meal was.

I had always just ordered the $75 omakase, and I don't know why.  This last visit, I got the $100 omakase, and wow, am I glad that I did.

First off, the waitress this visit was especially warm, friendly, and fun.  If I had one complaint about this place (and I'm really, really reaching here), it's that the service is perhaps a little too "formal".  Maybe that's just the Japanese way?  It's not bad or anything, but I like some back and forth with the wait staff, especially after a couple sakes.  Our waitress this time was more than happy to engage in some banter, answer questions, ask the chef questions, recommend and teach me about sake, etc.

The first course was a spiny lobster sashimi.  It arrived whole, with just the tail split and the meat scraped from the shell.  If I wasn't so sure otherwise, I'd swear the thing was still moving.  Fresh as heck.

The other courses were, of course, perfection.  The $100 course includes some more fanciful ingredients, like little baby anchovies (their little eyes freaked my wife out a bit but they taste fantastic) for seasoning the tofu.

What impressed me the most though, was when the spiny lobster CAME BACK!  This time, the front half of the lobster was cooked into a broth, with the tasty-but-usually-inaccessible meat integrated into the soup.  The tamale was also very tasty.

Can't recommend Raku enough.  There's a lot of contenders for my favorite restaurant.  Right now, Raku is confidently at #1.If you want to go somewhere that you will be welcomed like family, remembered as a friend and valued as a customer then 24 Carrots should be your next stop.

The Cafe is cozy and comfortable, I feel like I'm going over to a good friends house every time I stop by. 
You can sit and relax and share wonderful conversations, ideas and recipes with Sasha. If there is anything she can do for you she probably will, Sasha has the sweetest kindest spirit and it really reflects into her food. 

There couldn't be more love and passion put into her food if your grandmother made it. 

I've simply Loved everything I've ever ordered here. The menu has some solid choices but for me the magic lies in the daily specials. 
Everyday Sasha creates something new and exciting to tantalize your taste buds using fresh locally grown organic produce. 

You can follow 24 Carrots on twitter and facebook to hear what she's cooking up next.After a long hike we found this place on yelp. We arrived during happy hour, great prices!!!  Delicious choices good for both us and the environment.Great ceviche!!!!
Fish tacos were fresh and tasty.  
Service was fast and friendly. 
Felt like I was bk in Ensenada on spring break ;)really tasty. just go. you won't be bummed. don't forget to join their mailing list, too, always coupons and secret flavors :)Malted vanilla with a toasted marshmallow.  Perfection in my book!In the interests of full disclosure, I've been coming here for the past three years and love the place already.  I've had the good fortune to have sampled great gourmet across the country at places like Jeni's in Columbus, OH and Denise's in Boston and have been trying to adequately explain why Sweet Republic is better than those joints.  

Sweet Republic, in my humble opinion, I think balances flavors better than other ice cream places, with the addition that it makes absolutely everything in-house and sources locally.  Denise's has more flavors but only because it keeps unsuccessful flavors on the menu.  (But don't get me wrong, the place is great.). Jeni's fails to achieve the same balance of flavor that Sweet Republic has, though from consistency to creativity, they're equal in every other way.

Ah, screw it.  Sweet Republic makes their own bacon brittle and toasts their own homemade marshmallows.  That does it for me.Great room and stay at Encore. 

I've played and hanged out several times at Encore, so eventually I wanted to stayed here. Finally got a room with the GF and one of my boys. They're both Vegas virgins and Encore didn't disappoint their first time experience. 

I won't be redundant and describe every little details about the room. It's going to have the amenities and features you would expect. Plus, the infamous swivel TV. But suffice to say, it's nice, immaculate, and spacious. Nice, soft, comfy bed. Floor to ceiling windows with a nice view of the pools at Encore/Wynn and a bit of the strip. It was really cool to take the nice white leather desk chair put it in front of the windows, put your feet up, and take in the view. 

I had heard about the music at XS raging all night long. Although we wouldn't mind that so much due to that's the way we are and partly because we would stay up til sunrise anyway. I did request a higher floor room. We whine up being on the 37th floor and couldn't hear anything from XS or Surrender. 

Went to the Encore pool on Thursday and Friday. Nice garden ambiance. Resort pool with kids was not loud or obnoxious at all. European pool was nice as well, just a few girls that were topless. It wasn't that much of a party pool and I'm saying that in a good way. Nice and serene. Nice touch to have elevators leading directly to the pool and avoiding the casino floor. We went to the Wynn pool on Saturday. I would say the major difference is the Wynn pool is bigger and music is blasting from the European party pool. So to each their own. I did wish that both pools had more cabana girls serving drinks b/c the wait can be awhile before they get to you. 


Went up to concierge desk to get line passes to XS. Had a slight snafu there, wanted the tickets for Saturday night and told him that, he printed them for Friday. So we double check and one of the other concierge guy passed us and asked if everything was alright and then we asked about the passes. Turns out , the passes does have to be printed for the night you're going. Then he told us come back tomorrow and they'll take care of it. After waiting for a good while at the desk on Saturday, turns out, you can have the passes printed for whatever night anytime. So after discovering the mistake on Friday they could have printed passes for Saturday night right then and there. So be sure that the passes are printed for the night you're going, to avoid this situation. But still a minor thing in my book. 

Wherever we were at; valet, craps table, pool, or bar. The guest service was superb to us. The interaction was always polite, courteous, and warm. 

Another thing, I notice on the other reviews some Yelpers think the Encore is a little "off" or not as lively as Wynn or far from the strip. Granted the deli/cafe/buffet is at the Wynn and you have to walk over there. But I consider all of it one big resort, so don't be lazy about a leisurely stroll people!!! 

Another point, if you're a first timer and want to be near the strip or have a really good strip view. This place is not ideal. Even though you'll get a view of the pools and golf course. Your view will be partially block by the Wynn itself. The location is a little away from the action of the strip. Who needs it, if you're a Vegas regular and you don't need that toursity/kitsch of the strip. It goes back to the Encore being a more serene option to stay at.

Now, for the nightly atmosphere. I agree there is a subtle difference between Encore and Wynn. The Wynn is bigger, thus more people therefore more rowdy action. I would say Encore is crowded and the Wynn is packed. The difference can be visualize as the craps table at Wynn has a lot of 21yr olds and the tables at Encore has the 30yr olds that actually has money...I kid, I kid. But come Friday or Saturday night there are plenty of girls in heels prancing around at both places. At 5am Friday night/Saturday morning at the craps table, it was full and we had a rowdy good time with Josh & Sully from Buffalo. So I couldn't tell the difference. 

The beautiful surroundings and great guest service lead me to book a room here. I'm happy to tell you there was no let-down. Encore strives to be a boutique that caters to the more refine instead of the masses. It's suppose to be a different alternative to Wynn. A serene place to step away from it all when you want to. But when you're ready, it brings the heat too. Stay here.**Please note that I'm giving 5 stars for the room itself and the quality of service given here...not necessarily for all the restaurants, bars, casino, etc.**

We got a special promotion for this room and I have to say that (especially for the price I paid) it was amazing. The room was enormous, so comfortably appointed, really beautifully decorated, the bathroom was bigger than our bedroom at home...we had a view of "downtown" (seemed to be a view of the Rio and a Ross store), which was nothing to write home about, but that's because we checked in super-early; if we had been willing to wait longer we might have had a Strip view, but we had only slept 3 hours and were eager to rest and take a shower, etc. At least our room was very quiet; never heard any noise at night.

Service was so kind and courteous from my very first interaction. Whenever I called (to inquire about changing my reservation, etc.) the people I spoke to were super nice and helpful. Ditto when I got there; ditto when I called the front desk to ask a question; ditto when I stopped by the concierge and the bell desk for one thing or another. 

The whole property is absolutely gorgeous...gorgeous rooms, gorgeous lobby, gorgeous gardens, gorgeous pools, gorgeous restaurants and bars; even the casino looked much cleaner and "classier" than most of the others we walked through. 

My husband and I aren't gamblers, and this was our first trip to Vegas; it was just sort of that, "well, you've got to try it at least once in your life" types of trips, and in large part because I had gotten this amazing promotion. Honestly, the best part of the whole trip was the hotel, especially the bedroom...we also spent quite a bit of time at the pool (the sunset pool at the Wynn was our favorite) and that was great, but a little too crowded in the afternoon and the drinks were waayyy too expensive.

In fact, I'd say the only real drawbacks to the place (and I am sure it's the same problem anywhere in Vegas) was that everything--but EVERYTHING--was expensive. I needed sunscreen and tried to buy it at a store inside the resort--$32! Come on. We ended up walking about a mile to the nearest Walgreen's to find it at a somewhat normal price. It doesn't appear you can get a drink anywhere on the property for under $15, and even a small cappuccino runs $6 there!! A bit excessive. 

But I learned that's what Vegas costs...you can save on the hotel but they'll get you everywhere else...we probably won't be going back to Vegas anytime soon, but if we do, I'd definitely want to stay at Encore again--IF I get another good deal and can afford it!!I've been to this casino a few times. Staff is always willing to help you find your way and their pastries at the cafe are delicious. My boyfriend and I went to the sports book and bar to watch a soccer game and we had quite a good time. I enjoyed my pastry :) lemon bar :P and he enjoyed his game :)))Ever since my Korean spa experience at the Hyatt in Icheon, Korea, I have been constantly seeking similar establishments.  Unfortunately, no Korean spas exist (for guys at least) in Hawai'i.

So I did my yelp research and located a highly rated Korean spa in Las Vegas.  A perfect getaway from the heat and to recover from a previous night's debauchery.  

I made my way via taxi, however for some reason the taxi driver could not locate the building.  After calling the receptionist, she clarified the location as across the street from the Bank of America, but in a small lane behind the main buildings on E. Sahara.

The receptionist was pleasant and checked me in for my 30 minute Korean-style scrub and 60 minute Acu-Massage.  I arrived about forty-five minutes early so I could soak in their Jacuzzi.  I was handed their "uniform" t-shirt and shorts, required for the coed areas and sleep rooms.  Otherwise, you're in the buff (get over it!).

The facilities were immaculate and nicely maintained.  The locker room/lounge area was very comfortable, despite its starkness.  The television here was tuned to Korean soap operas (addicting stuff).  The leather chairs were a nice touch and the counters were filled with amenities such as soaps, disposable razors and shaving cream.  I kept coming here for the filtered water in an attempt to battle the alcohol I ingested practically hours ago.

I alternated between the steam and dry saunas to the Jacuzzi then the ice plunge that electrifies every nerve ending in your body as if it were on fire.  Love that feeling!  Reminds me of my road trip from Portland, Oregon to Anchorage, Alaska and skinny dipping in the glacier water as our daily shower.  Ah, better than caffeine.  

I was called to my scrub in an adjoining room and the guy worked his magic, polishing my body down to a pulp and splashing buckets of warm water between applications.  A great feeling to emerge renewed!  From the scrub, I showered and immediately started my Acu-massage in a separate massage room, equipped with bars on the ceilings for the therapist to play their footsie magic on my back.  Man, what a glorious experience Acu-massage is!  Part deep tissue, part Thai.  60 minutes of bliss!  When done, I headed back to the Jacuzzi, dry sauna, steam room, ice plunge rotation for about another 30-45 minutes.  

I did not try their coed section of other mineral and sleep rooms, but will defiantly try them if I ever return (and I hope to soon!)  Otherwise, I walked away a new man.  Ready to brave the sweltering summer heat and feeling lucky to tempt chance at the casinos.  An amazing start to my appointed spa day in Vegas.  An experience (and price) that does not exist on the Strip.

#Yelp 365:  054/365I love this place for a good weekend spot to get breakfast or brunch. My husband likes thier sandwhiches and biscuits and gravy. I love their new day combo...two pancakes/french toast eggs and sausage. 
I recently took an older friend of mine and she liked her patty melt
I go with my husband, parents, and friends. It is never overfilled and the service is excellent. I also love thier latte selection.
You can also go on restaurants.com to get gift certificates for both locationsOMG if this place was in San Diego, I would eat there 5 days a week. No joke. Wow. I ordered the zucchini kale vegan lasagna, kale salad with honey mustard dressing and a vegan gluten free kale pizza. I gotta tell ya- I feel so good after eating that scrumptious meal. Lauren was the most pleasant server I've ever encountered and this restaurant ranks in my top 5. Sage Kitchen is attached to an herbalist store and is so fitting. If you want a great meal without the crap ingredients and you live in AZ, come try this amazing food.Food fresh and light! Full of flavor. Best egg drop soup I've ever had! Jason had a full house and still managed to keep diners happy! Will come here for sure on my next visit to Phoenix! Kaari's new go to for Chinese!Fast delivery, great pizza!  Thx!the atmosphere here is as good as the food. You cannot be frumpy here!  The staff is the most polite, helpful and friendly of anywhere I have ever been. And the food!  I recommend the Jalapeño-Cilantro Hummus and Mahi Mahi. Also they have great local beers on tap!I can't say enough how happy we are to have found this place. We recently relocated and had been looking for really good traditional Italian food and this is it. We were told the owners are an Italian family from New York and it shows. We started with a round loaf of hot bread with a olive oil tappanade that was super tasty. We shared a spectacular, fresh antipasto salad with all kinds of yummy meats. I ordered my fave, chicken Marsala and it was everything Marsala should be. Hubby got the special, a stuffed pork tenderloin with fig, goat cheese, herbs and a white sauce that was out of this world. We were super impressed with the quality and taste of the food. I only wonder why the place isn't busier but it is in a bit of a weird location. I almost hate to let the secret out! We live almost a half hour away but will absolutely be making the drive back-well worth the reasonable prices for such a meal!! Also have to mention that the staff, including our server and the host, were fantastic and welcoming. What a find :-)YEAH FOR EPIC!  I made a last minute appointment before being invaded by my relatives.  Brett was able to squeze me into the schedule.  Fernando came to do the work, was very professional and my carpets look and smell great!  With three dogs and a 1 year old it's not easy to keep things clean.  They were great and I would use them again!Vegas Sports Nutrition is by far the best supplement store in all of Las Vegas.  They really know their products and will help you make the best decision.   I would highly recommend Vegas Sports Nutrition.Hard to find good Chinese food, especially if around this area by Westview HS. Came in on a recommendation, first thing I noticed it was clean, smelled clean too. Like bleach and pine sol, so for me that was a plus, came in for their lunch menu, cheap! I had the sweet and sour pork, came with fried rice, egg roll and wantons. Also got beef broccoli combo for the gf. Meat was meat and not fat. Fried rice wasn't the greatest but hardly gave any so for me it wasn't a biggie.Elyse took care of my concerns. Quick feedback! She turned things around for me.Love this gym. Has everything from basketball courts, raquetball, lots of free classes, indood and outdoor pool, tons cardio equipment, the free weights go up to 130 lbs dumbells for strongmen like me. There are plenty of hot looking women from early 20s to 50s. Most of the hot women do yoga or stair master.It is very rare for me to give an Indian restaurant a 5 out of 5 star.  I guess I have very high expectations of Indian places since I am Indian, so it takes a lot to impress me.  I came here with a Groupon with one of my friends who loves Indian food. 

We ordered a simple 2 entree, 2 bread, and rice portion.  We went vegetarian with Palak Paneer (my favorite dish), Malai Kofta, Garlic Naan, and Whole Wheat Roti.  The Palak Paneer, which is a spinach dish, had an interesting twist with how the spinach was blended into the seasonings.  Usually the spinach looks kind of boiled.  I was a little worried by that, but it tasted amazing.  I haven't ordered Malai Kofta much, but it tasted similar to previous experiences, which is always a good thing.  Both dishes had the right amount of seasoning and medium spice as we requested.  Both bread dishes met my expectations.

The service was excellent, which is not common in a lot of Indian restaurants that I have been to in Arizona.  The price was also very reasonable.  I am going to give another try for this place during lunch time for their $10 lunch buffets.My wife and I celebrated our 10th anniversary at this wonderful fine dining restaurant. The experience can only be described with one word, "wow." A good friend of ours recommended this special restaurant for our special occasion. Walking into the front door, we totally forgot that this restaurant is situated inside a busy and noisy casino. We were greeted by a warm smile and led to our seats. Our seats were out in the Vertical Garden surronded by green ivy going up on the wall.

We were handed two menus for select from. One menu is the 16 course degustation menu for $385 per person and a prix fixe menu that ranges from 2 course to 6 course meal to choose from. You really cannot go wrong with either menu. Since our reservation is at 8:30 pm, we thought the 16 course menu may go on too long. I decided to go with the 4 course and my wife went with the 2 course. The waiter were very helpful assisting us with our menu selections. My 4 course meal selection were Le Foie Gras duo mêlé d'artichaut violet en salade aux copeaux de parmigiano reggiano (Foie gras and violet artichoke salad with parmesan shavings) for appetizer, La Châtaigne et le foie gras dans un fin velouté soyeux sur un voile virtuel de lard fumé (Light chestnut velouté with foie gras, smoked lardons foam) for soup, Le Bar et poulpe aux fins aromates avec un jus de citronnelle, jeunes poireaux et artichaut (Pan fried sea bass and octopus with lemon grass, baby leek and artichoke) for main course and La Banane givrée et caramelisée au vieux rhum ambré et une émulsion crémeuse de lait de coco (Banana and passion fruit cream under a dark rum granité and coconut foam) for dessert. My wife selected Le Homard en salade mimosa de chou-fleur fondant à l'aigre doux et des croûtons dorés (Lobster salad with sweet and sour cauliflower mimosa and croutons) for appetizer, Le Bœuf la noix d'entrecôte émincée, épinards au wasabi et légumes arlequins (Beef ribeye, wasabi spinach and a medley of bell peppers) for main course and Le Chocolat grand cru à la glace Arabica, riz soufflé aux zestes de citron confit (Guanaja chocolate with coffee ice cream, caramelized puffed rice and lemon confit) for dessert.

After the tough menu selection, we then faced more choices. The waiter pushed the Le Pain (bread cart) with at least 20 different type of bread to select from. Then it came as a surprise, with the bread the waiter brought out Le Caviar to go with the bread. This is really the first time my wife and I had caviar, and it was excellent. I don't want to get into the detail of each dish that we had for reasons that one, I am not a food critic and two, you have to have it yourself to really know how wonderful each dish were. After the dessert, the waiter came by to show us this beautiful anniversary cake complimentary of the chief. The cake were to die for. Just when we thought that we could not be surprised any more, the waiter push Les Mignardises (charcolate cart) with over 42 different gourment charcolates.

The night was filled with surprises and excitment. I am so glad that we spent our 10th anniversary at this fantastic restaurant.Love this place. We eat here here 3-5 times a month. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu. They even took the time to talk to us about our special dietary needs and really fixed us up! Top notch from the food to the service to the atmosphere.I have a dog now, and can verify for anyone wondering that they are just as great with dogs as they are with cats. 

My dog absolutely loves going to the vet (I know, super weird) and runs up to greet everyone there because they are all just so friendly and kind to him. They always make sure that he is comfortable during every procedure, and help me to make decisions that make sense from a health standpoint as well as a financial standpoint.

Absolutely recommend.I was on my way out of town and I swung by my dads to give him a kiss goodbye before I left.  As I pulled in, my check engine light came on.  My auto guys are in the east valley where I live so I hopped on my Yelp app and found Honest-1 Auto care.  

I was in and out in less than 30 minutes.  The issue was completely benign and doesn't effect my vehicles performance.  I was relieved and delighted that they didn't tell me it was something that needed to be fixed ASAP just to make money.I have to admit. These shoes are not the cutest but they are comfy. I was really surprised. While I thought that they were only those ugly clog things, I was wrong. They have some other styles. The one I am most fond of looks like a ballet slipper style or something. Anyways, I have to say, at the least. . .I was surprised. I managed to find a good deal on a pretty ugly colored pair. But, that's not the point. They were for when I go outside with Kona Pie and play with her in the garden. Anyways, they were  cheap and they are comfy. Sales people there were friendly and we shared a few laughs about my misconceptions of their products. I was impressed though with the different colors, sizes and clip on accessory things, etc. Not too bad, considering they used to be the ugliest things on earth to me.Dinner was fabulous and worth the price!!This review is for the club only. I've been there twice and loved my experience both times. The decor is beautiful. The club is a bit more intimate than TAO which can be good or bad depending on the vibe you're going for. Music was good, place was packed with the prettiest of people and I got my Veuve on all night. Jackpot! Highly recommend.My friends and I ended up at the nightclub on Wednesday and really enjoyed ourselves.  Yes, the dance flood is small, but a lot of the clubs where I am from are similar. 

We ate here on Thursday, 9/20 and LOVED it!  I had the salmon and couldn't believe how delicious everything was.  I had read a bunch of reviews on here before we left for Vegas and almost changed my mind on eating here, but I'm certainly glad I didn't.  The restaurant was a little loud, but the food and the scenery made up for it.I've been going to RoadRunner sports for over 4 years after we moved to Scottsdale and would never go anywhere else.  Last week I bought a new pair of running shoesa and Tracye helped me find the perfect pair.   Today, I went back with my Mother-in-law who needed a pair of walking shoes and Tracye patiently helped her find the perfect pair of shoes. Between the selection and great customer service I won't go anywhere else!Oh. My. God. 

So, the burgers are delicious, great beers on tap, great warm, old-school wood-paneled atmosphere... Yes, and yes. But the impetus behind this five-star review was the chicken tzatziki taco special on December 19. Please, please make these a regular menu item! Ah. Maze. Ing. Especially with a hopquila margarita! So good!!! If you haven't been here, go!Staff was friendly, very open and inviting floor plan. Clean restaurant, fully stocked bar. 

The Cream of Mushroom Soup here is delicious but I wish it was vegetarian so I didn't feel so guilty cheating and eating it!

Join Club Veg so you can print coupons!!Love the service and the atmosphere. I indulged myself in the calamari and gnocchi. My wife had the tortellini. Both were so good. The pasta was very fresh. I have a new favorite Italian place to eat at. I will be coming back here for many more years.Professional, beautiful, awesome. 

This is a great place to get married. A couple of my best friends decided to get married at this location. The staff was super professional, and the wedding went off without a hitch. Spacious chapel with a great view. 

The waiting area was nice as well. They even gave one of my friends a bottle of water when he asked if they had a water fountain. Very cool.

For a nice experience and an even nicer wedding, this is a great place to check out.I love this place! They make you feel comfortable throughout the entire consultation and procedure. Steve answers any and all questions even after you leave! The feeling is more family/friend rather than patient/doctor. There was no pain! they gave me antibiotic ointment, anti-itch cream, and an ice pack before i left; all free!! (the icepack helps relieve the after feeling.)  The staff is amazing and I'm so glad to be removing my tattoo at serenity tattoo removal! Also I got free candy and let me tell you free candy is the best!! Haha I will post results of the removal at a later time:) thanks Steve!!!!! 

Ps I encouraged Steve to buy skyrim and he totally got it!! Love, love, love this place!!I went here with my besty from high school the day after Christmas and OMG! This was my first spa experience and I'm hooked for so many reasons. I walked in and was given a locker and sandals and a robe. There's plenty of showers and they're all  stocked with towels, soap, shampoo, conditioner etc. and they're CLEAN!! Got a hot stone massage from Frank and was in HEAVEN! I'm definitely going back for more R&R from here. I also received a facial from I think her name was Tiffany? I can't remember, but she was so cool and gave me tips on where to go on the strip for the best clubs etc. I didn't pay for this, but I heard the total and gathered that it was around 250 for a 70 min massage and 20 min. facial  Pricey but SO WORTH IT!!!! I think they have cheaper deals during the weekdays.If you have the taste for Thai, this is the ace in the hole.  Chicken mint potstickers are to die for.  We are major fans of basil chicken and though they don't have it the mint chicken was the perfect substitute.I used YELP to find a Mexican place with a good rating when we were in town. THANKS Yelpers! This place is awesome!!!!  Really cool gun place next door too.By far the best salon I have ever been to. I am always nervous about cutting/coloring my hair, but Marissa is consistently amazing. D'Lisa is also fantastic, and tames my brows to perfection in minutes. I've sent my boyfriend here, and would recommend this salon to all friends and family. A++!This is a carnivore's dream come true. SOMEBODY SLAP ME AND CALL ME A SLUT! 

Just keep the little disc they give you on green. 

Yes, yes, and more yes...I lived for some time in Rio de Janeiro and this "Rodizio' is the best I had outside of Brazil, simply perfect, it reminds me 'Porcao' and 'Marius'.
take a tip from a connaisseur : don't get too much food from the buffet, real brazilians focus on meat, specially "picanha"I've been to 4 out of the 6 Patty's Closet locations here in Vegas (this one, Summerlin, Henderson, and Town Square) and this location is my favorite.

The clothing pieces here are more my style of some reason. Even though there are 6 locations, each store is COMPLETELY DIFFERENT from each other. You won't find stuff at the Rainbow location at the Summerlin store. So if you see something that you like in one store, mind as well buy it right then and there because chances are you won't see it next time you visit and it won't be at other Patty's Closet locations.

Last time I was here, I found at least 5-6 items I liked while the other locations, I've only found a single item (IF that) that caught my attention. I bought two lightweight sweaters here for the upcoming autumn season. Also saw Patty's husband, Juan, at the store the day I was there. He was so friendly, started up a conversation with me and his customer service was spot on. The sales associate was great too. They attended me; suggesting items and placed everything I want to try on in the fitting room for me but they still gave me enough alone time to browse around.

Be sure to check in whenever you visit any Patty's Closet locations because it gives you a 20% off check in offer on your highest item.We love this place. The curry is the best, portions are huge and the staff are so friendly. We order from here 3-4 times a month and have never had a bad experience.This place ROCKS.  Found it through Groupon and even though we didn't buy the actual Groupon, they gave us the $10 off.  The restaurant is small and attached to a market and is pretty quiet.  Service is quick and friendly, prices are fair and the food is seriously yummy.  I've had better hummus before, but it's still really good.  All of their kabos and rice are super tasty and cooked and seasoned to perfection.  I have nothing to bad say about Zaytoon!  If it was closer to my house, I'd go here every week.What a gorgeous hotel!  The entrance alone was pretty impressive with it's large circular driveway and guys dressed in white uniforms ready to help you with your bags.  In fact, the staff throughout the hotel are all very friendly and helpful.  

Our room was elegant and we had a fantastic view of downtown from the 25th floor.  The beds were dressed with crisp white linens and they're oh so comfy.  There's a flat-screen tv on the wall, plenty of lighting wherever you need it, and the bathroom has a very spa-like feel.  Their towels are big and plush.  The Bliss bath amenities are mandarin orange and mint scented, which were refreshing and yummy-smelling.

I stayed for two nights and made my first visit to Phoenix a very comfortable one.  You really get a lot for the modest nightly rate.This is the only place that I 100% trust to care for my babies. The staff is phenomenal and Dr. Mauro is an absolute diamond. Their care for animals is unmatched in this industry. I am so lucky to have my furry family in their care.Tiffany and Kim are the BEST. :] I love their attention to detail in making my acrylics perfect. All my nails have the same thickness, length and are painted perfectly. They do not rush here.  They make me feel very comfortable. I love this place.Took my girlfriend here for the first time tonight, based on the reviews I read on Yelp. First off, the pita bread was an unexpected but welcome surprised, compared to the usual bread basket that is received at many restaurants. We each had a glass of riesling, which at $9 a glass is slightly higher than many other restaurants, but was definitely worth it. It was called "Kung Fu Girl", which i had never heard of. It was interesting to try something new.

Once the meal came, I had the Chicken Pasta dinner, and my girlfriend has her usual penne with marinara. We were both very satisfied with the meals, and the quantities were more than sufficient.

To close the dinner, the owner came out to ask us how the meal was and talk with us a little bit about the establishment. It was an excellent close to the meal, and secured our business for the next time around.I have been a fan of Ruth's Chris forever, but I must say our experience at BLT Steak  last Friday equaled or exceeded any steakhouse meal we have had before.  The popovers you get before the meal are wonderful, but resist the temptation to eat all of them as then you will either leave a lot of food behind or take a lot home.  The steaks we ordered (filet for my wife, bone-in rib eye for me) both were perfectly cooked with a nice outside char.  The various sauces available also are a nice touch.  What helps this place stand out however are all the great appetizers--we had German potato balls and poached green beans and both were wonderful.  Desserts too, were excellent.  It seems that Scottsdale supports an immense number of high end steakhouses, but if they are all this good, I can see why!My wife and i just dined at this restaurant. I am a chef and must say that Chef Chris's concept is one I have not experienced.The food was outstanding, service excellent and the decore was creative,down to the flower pot wine bucket and old wooden crate that it sat on.  Our entrees were served on either a bed of sundried ploenta or baby spincach and blackrice.  What really intrigued me was the slaw made of shredded green papaya that was part of the appetizer course. Being a chef I had to share a neat appetizer, that i recently found, using a baby corn shoot!  Chef keep up the suberb Cafe Monarch Bravo.Went there for the first time last week and I loved it. The moment we walked in, we were seated at the bar where the smiling waitress immediately gave us chips and salsa. As soon as we ordered our beef tongue tacos and carne asada tacos, we had to wait about 5 minutes to get our food (and personally, I was so drawn into the soap opera on the TV, I hadn't even noticed). Everything was delicious. The meat and the tortillas were hot and fresh, sprinkled with cilantro and a splash of fresh lime. We devoured our meal in no time flat. 
The best part is that it was crazy cheap! We spent under $20 for two people with a ton of tacos and beer. I will definitely be coming back.Best fish and chips in town. Add a soft shell crab for 4.99.Great local friendly bar and the kitchen is reopenedI have only been here once, today, but i can say, I'll definitely be back regularly.  

I enjoy a coffee house where I can relax, drink my coffee(S) and read without feeling rushed out the door.  i was comfortable at my table for the better part of 3 hours and the staff was fantastic.

I was also happily surprised at the quality of food.  I ordered a turkey wrap-of-sorts, and it was great, Fresh, Made to order, very good.

Like i said,  I will be back here regularly, as I look for much more in a coffee house than just coffee. 

Great Job Sunrise!!The restaurant has a wonderful atmosphere and is always filled lots of people, music and great food!  Whether dining with a large group or alone, you will never fill like a stranger; the staff is awesome and very friendly.  What really makes this restaurant stand out is the menu!  The menu is filled with gluten-free options--real gluten free options, not just meat, veggies and potatoes--but foods like red quinoa and brown rice pasta!  This is a major for people on a gluten-free diet because there aren't many restaurants that serve these sorts of foods!  

During my visit to True Kitchen, I ordered the Ginger Nojito drink, the Wild Halibut with fava beans and red quinoa and the orange sorbet for dessert and it was very good and I was impressed! I think that Sam Fox and Dr. Weil, definitely hit a home run for people with restrictive diets such as gluten-free, soy-free, dairy-free, as well as low sodium and low glycemic index foods. 

Now, some folks who do not have health challenges that prohibits them to eat restrictive diets may not appreciate a restaurant like this one.  However, I have been to several restaurants where I leave frustrated and disappointed, because they could not accommodate my diet or offer an alternative, so when I found this restaurant I was elated!  Even though I don't do dairy, soy, or alcohol, I still think based on the number of gluten free items and customer service, I gave it a high rating.  Despite the 5 stars, as always, there's room for improvement such as adding rice milk based menu items to the list.Oh True Food...I have visited you many times since your opening and you never fail to deliver on great service and yumilicious food.

I really love your Summer Salad which I had on my most recent visit...the perfect combination of ingredients..it makes my heart sing. (I hope that I can get the summer salad in the winter?) I know you like to mix things up my darling True Food...

I also had the Watermelon Rose cocktail which may be my favorite cocktail of late...

You just make me so happy True Food!! Thank you for being you and sorry I didn't review you sooner....I would never take you for granted!Amazing restaurant and food.  Right up there with seasons 52.   Will come back when in PhoenixI love this place! They have daily specials and home made goodness!Awesome! If you are going for lunch, get there before noon or you'll have to wait in line.. Get the P10 and hot if you want to clear your sinus's. It's delicious..one of our favorite hotels in the whole entire world.  great location, especially if you're there for the fringe festival, and room size and furnishings were closer to a westin standard.  as usual of all starwood hotels, the beds were heavenly.  the hotel designer must've had fun with the bathrooms, which are set off with smoked glass...bath tub, separate shower, mood lighting (purple, red, green, plain).  i won't tell you which color we chose.

the bar has a variety of scotch which was fun to sit ourselves down for a tasting after a long sightseeing day.  we ate at the bar a couple times and the food was really good - we missed american classics like a solid club sandwich and caesar salad.

we went last spring and the hotel is still on our mind.  i think they just went through some major remodeling so can't wait to see how it looks this summer when we return.You'd be forgiven for walking straight past the entrance to this place, tucked down a flight of steps just off George Street, but in my opinion that's half of it's charm. It's popular and highly-regarded without needing to shout about it; people know about it because of the quality, not because it's in your face.

It's easy to see why. When you step inside it's like being on some sort of Japanese garden terrace, with the green leafy plants and water feature. Rick's pay great attention to detail: every table has a copy of that morning's newspaper neatly folded on it, next to the fresh flowers, and the service is efficient without being annoying and intrusive.

Although it's never going to make the Top 10 list of cheapest places in Edinburgh, you do get what you pay for. That said, at the moment all of the Montpeliers venues have their "Better By Half" promos on: glasses of house wine, selected cocktails, selected beers and even champagne by the glass are all half price at the moment. I've been making the most of these offers every time I'm out for fear that they might finish soon, but despite my panic-drinking it seems they're here to stay for a whie yet. Happy Days.

I've only ever drunk here, but one of these days I will be going for food... the plates I've seen being carried to other tables do look and smell gorgeous. There are always enough people in here to give the place a nice buzz, but never enough to make it the kind of busy where service starts to slump and the temperature goes through the roof.Absolutely brilliant fun, very immersive, and a great way to learn some of Edinburgh's less savoury history! The staff/actors are fantastic, be prepared for a scare!After attending their tasting event on Friday 7th February, I felt compelled to leave Demijohn a gleaming review, and let me just say what those guys don't know about the production of liqueurs and oils probably isn't worth knowing!

From its humble beginnings the family-run and self-proclaimed 'world's first liquid deli' a decade ago, Demijohn goes all out to provide the finest array of vinegars, liqueurs and oils I have ever seen. Whether you are looking for a simple olive oil or a unique single-cask whisky, you will find it here.

The staff are more than helpful and will actively encourage you to sample their offerings in order to decide what's the right product for you.

We didn't buy anything on this occasion, but I intend to go back this week and replenish my empty mead bottle. Word to the wise, I.J Mellis the cheesemonger is right next door, so if you are on the hunt for a decent tipple, then why not make a night of it and grab some amazing cheese too!Unpretentiously charming little place I just happened upon after a wet cold dreary day of sightseeing.

 Had the walnut graham cake. Unbelievably good.The Dogs is a quirky little restaurant reached by ascending an unassuming staircase on Hanover St. The bright and airy main dining room is packed full of odd tables and chairs, there's even a church pew to sit on.

The regularly changing menu comprises of traditional British food (lamb's hearts, skirlie, roast chicken) and is served on mismatched crockery by friendly and knowledgeable staff. Make sure you order a portion of the chips, they are cooked in dripping (the traditional, unhealthy, way!) and are to die for. If you have room for pudding, the lemon posset is a perennial favourite of mine - citrusy, light and creamy.

The Dogs manages to be stylish and unpretentious, whilst also serving up great food - it's the kind of place that you would feel equally comfortable in with your parents or your friends. Make sure you book in advance!I wanted to try this place since I moved to Edinburgh and I'm glad to report that it was as good as I had hoped. The cola pork belly was delish and the manager recommended a chocolate orange desert special which was just amazing. The hard chairs can be ignored and the atmosphere is very relaxed. The staff were friendly and I loved the quirkiness. I've decided to bring all my visitors here.371492816 great restaurants in Las Vegas.
For my birthday dinner, I chose Pizzeria da Enzo.
3rd year in a row.
True story.I stopped in their last night right before I hit up the Jamie Foxx concert at the Dodge Theater. It's a cute little place. Very, clean and quite quiet on a Thursday evening. But then again it was technically after hours (7pm) in the downtown area so unless major is going on it just may be like this all the time. 

The guy that took care of me was really sweet. I wish I would have gotten his name. He was patient as I was trying to decide on the only slice of pizza I wanted. LOL In the end I choose a huge slice of piping hot pepperoni and for under $3.00 for my slice, not to shabby. 

I sat myself down and watched some of the college football game and enjoyed my wonderfully delicious slice of pepperoni pizza. I swear their was pepperoni in ever bite. It wasn't greasy and the crust was just perfect. He even checked up on me to make sure I didn't want a second slice. My mind was screaming YES, YES but alas I was good and politely declined.

Very friendly, very clean, great prices and damn good pizza. They have tons of specials so you can't go wrong. Check this place out if you haven't already.Just South West of Edinburgh lies a range of hills called the Pentlands, stretching 20 miles, across to Biggar. It's hard to review a geographical feature in itself (though they are undoubtedly beautiful) but you can say something about their effect. Being right outside Scotland's capital, the Pentlands make a great opportunity to escape the city and get some proper fresh air. As someone who grew up in the country, I really appreciate this.

This park doesn't feature some of the biggest or most challenging hills in Scotland, the tallest being Scald Law with an elevation of just under 580m, but this adds to its less daunting charm. The Pentlands is popular amongst amateur and professional hill walkers and those just out for a stroll as well as mountain bikers, dog walkers and others. There are many many routes to take, but if you are approaching from Edinburgh, unless you stray too far, you can't really get too lost, especially during the summer when there tends to be quite a lot of walkers about. This can be an issue for some and I know others prefer quieter, more secluded parks to walk.

You can easily get a bus out to the Pentlands. I would recommend taking the number 40 bus to Bonaly, or the McEwans 100 to Flotterstone. Once you're there is pretty obvious which way to walk to soon be into the Pentlands, although obviously there are a number of exact starting location depends on where you want to walk.

Details of specific walks as well as further information can be found on the website.Remember in my last review where I said I should never be allowed back in here? Then why did no one stop me from going back in and purchasing something for myself?! Not that I'm complaining, quite the opposite. I couldn't be more pleased with my purchase, and the service.

Rosie Brown's is an independent jeweler in which they display their hand-made jewelery in the same store that they make it (out the back). Very pretty, trinkety and quite unique pieces, they have different ranges that all revolve around silver jewelery. Bangles, chain bracelets, earrings, rings and necklaces with little charms such as hearts, stars, cherries, birds, pearls. Think pretty, not mainstream, and made with love.

As Chris M recently referred to me and my 'tiny sleeves', I do indeed have tiny wrists inside those tiny sleeves. So small that I have never been able to find a bracelet that doesn't almost reach my elbow. I was busy admiring all the bracelets in here and asked to try a few on, all of which proceeded to reach said almost-elbow point.

"Oh we can resize those for you?"
"At a cost?"
"No, no just for the same price."
*little silver lightbulb goes off above Jenny's head*

My window-shopping turned into serious shopping. I finally decided on a chain bracelet, with a little pearl and the bird motif charm. I asked if they'd just resize the one I'd tried on and she said, no, they'd make me my own fresh new one. Wow. Ok.

So she measured my wrist, and told me to come back in a week. Done.

But then 2 days later I had a change of heart. I wanted the heart motif, not the bird. I popped in to let them know my decision - no problem.

I popped back two weeks later (a little late) to pick up my first, ever perfectly fitting bracelet that I would ever have owned. It was actually a little too small. It fit but I think I'm so used to at least some movement I wanted a few more links added back in. 

"Not a problem, we can do that right now, come back in...20 minutes." Ah the beauty of having the craft-station in the store.

It just so happens two of Edinburgh's best chocolate shops are nearby, so these 20 minutes were happily spent. Back I popped, the bracelet fitted like a charm, and then off I went wearing my beauteous new bracelet. That fits!

It's only our first day together but already I am thrilled with  my new piece. (I think anyone who is a jewelery person will understand what I mean when I say 'piece'. I bought this with the intent of wearing it almost as I wear my hair, ie: part of me, almost unremoveable. It's to be worn everyday, but still a special item. And in fact that's Rosie Brown's ethos They make wearable jewelery for everyday, that is more special than the £10 high street fashion stores.

I was also really impressed with the customer service. The fact that fresh items are made for every customer who is sized, at no extra cost, and they were able to tailor it to my exact size when I went to pick it up there and then. A happy customer am I.

My *only* complaint is that they never answered their phone! I did try to call to change the charm, but no one answered, or called back from my message. Twice. Hmm odd. Other than that, faultless.I know everyone says it's overpriced but...the experience is SO fun !! Well worth the $$ I can't wait to go back on my next trip to Vegas !!Okay could anywhere in the world be more beautiful (on the inside I mean).  The outside of this little church has been under construction forever I've been told.  The inside is amazing though.  I am NOT a fan of Dan Brown books.  I actually really dislike them but I agreed to go here anyways and thank goodness I did.  It is the coolest and most beautiful chapel that I have ever been to.  I loved it and could have spent the entire day just sitting inside and being there.  MUST MUST MUST do!My first time eating "chicken tostada" and was very interesting and delicious. Service was fast and the food didn't take long to come even in a party of three.
If you like tacos and similar I highly recommend.The best department store chain in the UK ... simple as thatVery clean, friendly staff, great service and the food is better than most places I've been to. Definitely will come back and recommend to fit ends and family.This is a proper fish shop that even has water cascading down the window. There is usually a queue out the door that's how great this fish shop is. They don't stock a great amount of unusual fish, but you can get tuna and swordfish on a regular basis. They sell the biggest eggs. The eggs are such great value and are nearly always double yolks.
The staff are always up for a bit of cheeky banter.
As this is a proper fish shop, it's always closed on a Monday.This place is the pinnacle of what makes a great pub - instead of using their recent refurbishment to make it young & trendy, they kept the traditional style and just cleaned it up a bit. Friendly landlord and locals, an impressive range of guest ales, and a decent beer garden to soak up the rays on a sunny day (admittedly something as rare as a beer garden itself in Scotland).This is a great fishmonger and I'm yet to be dissatisfied with their products, or their service. I always get both my fish and my free range eggs (?). Not only is it a superior product, but it is less expensive than any of the supermarkets nearby or in town (including sale/special prices from the major supermarkets). The staff know the products, can give advice about preparation when requested, and of course it's always good to support local business.Great burgers. I hope they are truthful, on the menu it states "humanely sustained beef."  Would be even better if it were organic grass fed, but one can dream. :o)  Usually prompt service, cute joint for a strip mall. However, a tad pricey for a burger, (ok, i do get the buffalo, and it's $14 or $15).  I most likely  wouldn't go here without a living social or groupon deal. But, luckily those are usually easy to find, and so I'm a regular here....I'm not much for going out. But I LOVE SideBar. And I always have to ask myself why.

It's overpriced, the food is meh, BUT...

The bizarro movies on the screens ROCK! I'm either trying to figure out what's going on or what the name is so I can watch it later.

And most important, the men who go there are GORGEOUS in both personality and physical appearance. I'm quite shy but somehow I end up chatting with someone for a couple of hours when I'm there. That's without the alleged benefit of Dutch courage.

Easily a place to go where I can grab a nice drink by myself and either not be bothered or be bothered... depending on my mood.Great bar. My girlfriend and I like to stop here a couple times a month when we want to try something different! The atmosphere inside the bar is very swanky and intimate. The main reason we stop in is for the beer selection. They have many beers and house drinks you just can't get anywhere else. I highly recommend you check this place out!Came across this salon with the idea of going blonde from dark brown box color! Other salons would talk me out of it not Jen she was very confident that she could give me the look I was after!  She did just that, I have been with her for 3 yrs now!  This girl gives an AWESOME CUT &  BLOW OUT!  It stays perfect for 3 days or longer!  She also has put those trendy feather and colored extensions in my hair and daughters hair, super cute!!  My 11 yr old son is into the hair tattoo style and what they call line up.  Roberto is FABULOUS with this skill, he is very artistic and has good vision!  I just love this shop! Great Customer Service and its full service!! Great Job Platinum staff!!I love this place!!! The breakfast is huge portions with even bigger flavor and the happy hour is a great deal! My favorite dish: Chicken Nacho's (can be eaten as a meal)!!One of the best brunch restaurants hands down.  Great food, great selection, love the outdoor seating n coffee/juice bar while you wait.  Staff is friendly and knowledgable about the menu/food.  Great mimosas!!This place is fantastic. The service here is the best I've had in a long time. They really treat you like an honored guest. The food is also amazing! It certainly is a carnivores delight. While EVERYTHING was delicious, the stand outs for me were the bacon wrapped Filet Mignon and the their juicy garlicky signature sirloin. Just so you don't O.D. on meat they do also have a wonderful salad bar which has various peppers, cheeses, and cured meats in addition to the good selection vegetables.OMFG.Best of the best in VEGAS. On Zagat scale 27! It is in an unassuming location waaaay off the strip.The place itself is casual looking with TVs playing sports and 70's and 80's music playing. The waiters we really friendly and very attentive.Everyone was so pleasant and seem like they love working here. The menu is onblackboards, but as a 1st timer they recomended the "around the world" tasting menu. Totally the way to go! Got to taste so many dishes, and each one was better than the last.
Yummyyummyyummy. Coming back asap.Unpretentious mature atmosphere, fresh fast food with accurate menu descriptions and great service .This salon is in fact very classy. Super clean and very well kept. The owner, Eileen, is super friendly & helpful. I've been coming to this shop for 5 years for a reason. Every employee does a great job. 

Services offered are manicures, gel/acrylic nails, pedicures, deluxe pedicures, waxing, specialty nails (Hello Kitty) etc. I've had just about every service they offer :) Come to this shop! The prices are great. Not too expensive. 

Ask for a design on your toes. Flowers, hearts, etc. 

Last but not least there is no TV blaring. I can't stand when shops do that.This place is hands down the best club in Vegas. Wait scratch that. This is the best club that I've been to from San Francisco to LA to Vegas. 

What was so fabulous about XS: 
- The extravagant decor. Million and millions were spent on this place and it actually shows. 
- The indoor/outdoor layout. Yes it's just like Tryst but XS's outdoor area totally smashes on Tryst's waterfall. 
- The pool/lagoon and the bar right smack in the middle of it. Can't wait to see how it's used during the summertime. 
- The size of the club. It's huge! No need to push and shove even if it's crowded. 
- The crowd. You don't get your typical freshly-turned 21 crowd like in Tao. 
- Seating. Even if you don't have bottle service, you can still sit in a booth/reserved spot if it's not being utilized. 
- Music. Well the music for the first hour that we were there was top notch and totally danceable to. After that, you can tell they switched DJ's as it was straight hip hop from then on. 
- Lighting. With the chandelier and lights beaming on the dance floor, you totally get that club vibe, unlike some places where it's just dim to dark everywhere.

I'm not sure about the drink prices as my fiance paid for everything. And not sure about entrance fees as we got in for free.

To sum it up, I had the best time at XS then in the other Vegas clubs that I've been too. Some places really have to step up their game now.XS might have taken the throne as the Hottest club in Vegas currently. This is definitely one "ballin" ass club (as my friend called it). This place is huge. Complete with outdoor patios,plenty of pole dancing action,  poolside partying, and even outdoor blackjack tables. When you first walk in, you notice XS resembles the same layout as Tryst, except BIGGER and BETTER. Definitely no expense was spared to build this club. When I inquired about it before going, my friend replied.. "The BEST club EVERRRR!" Of course she was severely intoxicated.. but she wasnt far off in my opinion. XS should be on everyone's agenda when coming to Vegas. Be ready for some long lines and early arrival though. Find some hooks or else you're gonna spend hours outside!Great energy, fantastic vibe, delicious drinks, and a good mix of people...XS nightclub is everything you could ask for!

We went for the Halloween party and meant to get there early because we heard that the line can get pretty crazy after 9:30ish, but we stopped by Society Cafe for a snack so we were running a bit late!  When we got to XS a little after 10 PM, the line was insanely long, but we were all in good spirits and finally made our way to the end.  As a big group of girls, we attracted the attention of a promoter who gave us passes to get in for free.  And, to top it off, a few minutes later another member of the staff let us completely skip the line, saving us probably at least 45 minutes!  

Once we got inside, the ambiance was breath-taking and the staff were dressed in some pretty incredible costumes. The music was awesome, the club go-go dancers were completely amazing and drew quite a crowd, and the drinks were delicious and average-priced.  And don't forget about the huge outdoor area around the pool lined with bottle service tables and floating beds!  There's even an outdoor casino for those who want to mix it up.

All in all the place is gorgeous, as are the people, so don't miss out!i did not think i'd like XS (not much of a club-goer), but yeah.... this place is super fun! good music, good vibe, good crowd, outdoor blackjack tables. Come with girls and get pretty, so you can skip that ridiculously long line to get in. 

2 major cons: drinks are weak, and it takes FOREVER to get one as well (they need to hire more bartenders).Most amazing club that I have ever been to! Who would not like the fact that you can win money and get drinks on the house while in a club??

Ratio was great and the atmosphere was something that I will never find in the SF bay. For sure I will return!It's an awesome, cool place with yard, outdoor pool and hot tubs!!! Had a great time with my girls there~~~ Make sure you are on the guest list to get in easier without cover charge.My favorite club in Vegas. It is definitely the most crackin'. Perfect amount of space. The music is great. They play hip hop for the first few hours and then electro/house whatever afterwards. 

Unlike Surrender, you can actually stand in the shallow parts of the pool where the pool beds are. AND, you can lay on the pool beds and just chill.

I always have a good time here. Be sure to come early and get stamped or else you'll be waiting in line for days.Highlight of my last trip to Vegas, even with a 90 minute wait. Yeah, 90 minutes.. that part was pretty weak. They kept letting people with a 51%+ F:M ratio in, leaving our group of 2:3 in line (my ex tried to flaunt her stuff to no avail). But enough of that, this place was AWESOME. A great DJ, awesome crowd and (for Vegas) cheap, strong drinks. I have a special admiration for anyone who can dish out drinks as fast as the XS bartenders. 

A++ would get drunk here againI swear i'm the biggest XS advocate of all time!

BY FAR THEEEE BEST CLUB hands down.
Since its opening, XS is a must every time I am in Vegas. heck, I went both nights this past weekend and I didn't mind it one bit!

GO GO GO GO GO!We've stayed at the Wynn a couple of times and always manage to end up here somehow.

Their breakfast is amazing - extremely memorable frittata.

Their drinks and snacks are great.  I had a sip (or glass) of about 10 different libations and all were top notch.

For being just off the casino floor, the ambiance is surprisingly sophisticated, relaxing, and inviting.Dinner was great.  The environment was very pleasant.  My favorite was the server who made us totally comfortable while we stayed and stayed.great placeI love everything about this restaurant. It's classy but still semi casual. The decor is soo lavish. Deep red paint, white leather chairs and a Huge Swarovski crystal dragon!! It's a head turning restaurant. 

Food is delicious!! Drunken noodles with beef are my all time favorite. The seafood fried rice was perfectly seasoned and crispy.  Huge pieces of scallops!! I love WazuzuFirst, there's a $10 discount on the entire fixed menu during happy hour, which (I believe) runs from 3-6.  If Posh is usually a little out of your budget, this can be a life-saver, especially if you're going for the 4-course.  It kept our bill under $100.

Book a seat at the chef's table.  We both loved watching all the different dishes being prepared and being able to ask about the ingredients and dishes.  The chefs were more than willing to answer questions, and would sometimes check in about our preferences about ingredients before prepping our next course.

If you have a particular food fetish, tell someone!  I happen to adore truffle oil, so I let our server know, and wrote it in the "other things we should know" section - and they specially prepared me a dish with truffle oil.  Which inevitably led to a foodgasm, and a foodgasm always leads to an extra star.

Another star for comping us the foie gras course, after I saw how beautiful/delicious it was, and wished (out loud) that I'd just dropped the $15 to the chef - he was such a sneaky charmer about it, too, and the server was practically beaming when I gushed over how delicious the dish was.  It was awesome to see everyone taking such pride in pleasing my palate.

Everything was perfectly executed, and completely delicious.  If I were rich, I would come here once a week.  

As it is, I just have to satisfy myself with waking up in the middle of the night, imagining the perfect interplay of the smooth, creamy foie gras with the spun sugar and berries.

(also, the post-dinner cookies and lollies are also amazing)I had a fantastic time at the zoo and was really impressed by it since I didn't know just how nice it is or how many great animals they have there. The two pandas were stunning to see, although they are so sedate just sitting and munching away on their bamboo that they were more mesmerising than anything. I loved seeing the playful penguins that were so cute, as well as the adventurous and even rowdy monkeys. The zebras, flamingos and tigers were also stunning in their own ways. The zoo is a lot bigger than I had expected and it is very well maintained. There are so many great animals to watch.

The layout of the zoo makes it feel a bit like you're on an adventure popping up different paths and peeping into different enclosures and pools. Despite the pricey admission (£16 for adults or £50 for a family of four!), the zoo is really well kept and it is evident how much care and effort goes into the maintenance, research, and keeping the animals happy. The zoo not only has great animals to see but also hosts talks with zookeepers telling about the animals, which were interesting.

One of my favourite surprises of my trip here was going up on the Sky Climber! It is a great structure of ropes, obstacles and balance beams one floor up in the air. The friendly staff ensured we were safely secured in harnesses before we ventured up to test our balance and have some good, old-fashioned fun in an adventure course up in the air. It was really brilliant!I had a conference in Caesars Palace for a little over a week and I would sneak down to Beijing Noodle No. 9 for lunch every chance I got.

Initially, all I could think about was the cool decorations.  There are columns and sections of wall filled with water and real goldfish.  The ceiling and the floor matched the contemporary, watery-fish decoration so it's almost like sitting in a room that Michael Jackson considers his "fishy room."  A little off-putting but still very cool.

The food itself was excellent.  I cannot rave enough about the Kung Pao Chicken which is easily the best item on the menu.  That dish contains all white meat and hardly any fat.    I feel like a perverse old man describing an Olsen twin but oh well.

My co-workers ordered several other somewhat mainstream Chinese dishes and they were solid.  The restaurant also offers sushi but it was mediocre at best.

Beijing Noodle is expensive but it's Vegas and I challenge you to find a cheaper on-strip restaurant.

The wait staff was very nice and responsive, I don't think I had to ask for more water once in my 5 or 6 visits.  But because it's so easily accessible to Caesars Palace patrons, it can get pretty busy at times so make a reservation or else you'll be waiting a few minutes for a table.I love this place.

After the worst dining experience on the other side of Caesars at Michel Richard, my buddy and I sat down at the noodle counter and waited for it to open.

I watched my noodles get made, cooked and prepared by the master noodle maker (i'm sure there is a Chinese word for this) and had the best bowl of Pork, Mushrooms and Noodles.

I think my wife is still mad at me for not bringing her along.  Next time...Woke up on Saturday and decided I needed to try something new that I have never had before. So I turned to the fine Yelpers I have come to know and love and found Cornish Pasty with the highest reviews in Mesa. Off I went having no clue what I was in for and never having had "British" food. 

I have now found my new favorite obsession!!! We ordered two Pasty to share... the italian and the spicy chicken asagio. Both were my favorite! They were stuffed with lots of ingredients and came with sauces and were very tasty. We also got the oven chips with garlic and jalapeno. I think these are the best "chips" I have had anywhere hands down. We wanted more but were stuffed! However, not too stuffed to go for dessert. We shared the banana/carmel/graham cracker crust/whip cream pie. And wanted to lick the plate clean and fought like 2 year olds over the last bite! While it was large enough for two people and probably three people, it was so good that I think next time we will start with dessert!

Love the atmosphere here as well. Really unique and we don't have much around Mesa that really transports you to another place. I can't wait to go back and have found my new obsession!I read the Yelp review before I brought my family there.  However, unlike it mentioned in the reviews, this is a premium steakhouse located in a  5-star Marriott Resort next to its Pro golf Shop.  Most of its customers are business people and casual dressing is not recommended although it is not prohibited.  Main courses (steaks) are amazing and priced between $38 and $50.  Therefore, it shall be a $$$$ (over $60 pp) instead of $$$ restaurant.  You can choose the salt among 6 different styles of sea salt and 5 different kinds of steak source.  The menu is ala carte therefore, sharing side and appetizers are common.  The $17 appetizer "tower of sea food" is well-worth its price, that includes half lobster, 2 oysters, 2 jumbo shrimps, 2 crab legs.  The steaks and seafood are perfect.  Unfortunately, Arizona law prohibits customer to bring their own wine, which is not accustomed by Californian like us.   The waitress and waiters service is 5-star.  After all, we had a great dinner with higher price that was not originally expected.Pita Jungle in Gilbert has been our go-to lunch spot in the area for the last couple of years. It's always packed whenever we go, and the laidback hipster servers are always friendly, on point, and attentive in their own ways. Their menu has a wide range of mediterranean and some middle eastern healthy dishes, and I don't think we've ever had something we don't like. Today we had the mahi mahi with pita chips and some type of healthy veggie-pizza on a flat bread (?). Both were excellent. We'll continue to go as long as it keeps rockin. I'm surprised there are only a few locations in the valley.I've eaten at this location several times and always had a great experience.  The servers are prompt and friendly, food is always great (and served at the correct temperatures) and the restaurant is clean.  I recently used them to cater a small party at my house and was very impressed.  The food was great and they packaged everything to make it easier for me to re-platter.  The serving sizes were generous and everything tasted amazing.  Will definitely use their catering services again.Service is always great and the food always consistent. My favorite location.What a wonderful surprise to find Chef Michael DeMaria had opened another restaurant. Formerly, we were fans of Michael's at the Citadel.  The innovative concept for this restaurant is outstanding. It combines the ever changing freshest of ingredients with the most wonderful inspired recipes to offer just he perfect menu selections for those  for want a light meal or a heartier one. The menu outlines the chef fresh ingredient in the dish with its other components in a list from lighter to more complex. Everything from the first visual impression, the excellent knowledgeable wait staff, the delicious bread sticks and the wonderful menu is done with integrity and good taste.  We will definitely return on our next visit to Scottsdale.  We only wish we could visit more often as the menu change every month. Congratulations on a very novel restaurant innovation.Delightful: so many wonderful choices!ALOHA LAS VEGAS yelpers!

just moved to Las Vegas and I found myself craving Hawaiian food!

Found I.F. on yelp and got super excited!
Called in my order and picked it up.

I had the mix plate- pork/kalbi, kona coffee mud pie, and shoyu poke.
It was my guys 1st time having hawaiian food so I talked him into getting the hamburger steak. I grab 4 spam musubi's at the counter.

We loved the food! 

I'll def come back for more! 

Take out or dine in. casual. indoor seating.

Big serving! 

My whole order came out to around $50 fpr 2 people.

If you love Hawaiian food, stop by Island Flavor!

Aloha!
- Miss Yelp 2011Really cool place! I especially enjoyed all the outdoor exhibits, which were FREE. Easy to miss these if you dont take a walk on the grounds. There are old locomotives you can actually go inside, period houses, a print shop, telegraph office, church and barn. All are full of period furnishings and cool antiques. Plus its only $2 for adults and $1 for kids for the indoor exhibits. This is a small museum but definitely worth a look if you like history & artifacts.I love this place.  So cute.  The food is great.  A real gem in the area.This place is awesome.  Most refreshing aroma throughout the gaming area.  Kind of "spa like".  Nice to not feel engulfed by smoke for a change.

Haven't tried the restaurants yet but the buffet looks fairly interesting.5-star quality from a 5-star hotel. We came here for my birthday and we got a Sky Suite, which came with a limo to pick us up and drop us off to the airport, super comfy bath slippers, our own personal entrance/exit in and out of the hotel, personal doorman, and more. Our room was super high-tech, where everything such as lights, music, TV, and temperature was controlled by a screen pad. We had fun playing with this although it was a little hard to figure out at first. All in all, a wonderful stay. Def the best hotel on the strip.I am a HUGE fan of Aria.

I love the architecture, design, feel and energy of this place.  If you like modern then this is place to be.  If you like hip, relevant decor and people then this is the place to be.  Great layout for a casino, great specials on rooms when they have them and truly in the center of the strip.  You can go to Crystals to shop or walk over to Bellagio for the water fountain show.  This place has it all!Very classy hotel that isnt overly decorated.

What can I say, this is a very nice hotel, and nicely decorated.  I love Bellagio but it's too bling blingy whereas this place is very modern and nice.  Service is nice, food is great, very relaxing and comfortable.  The location is really good too.  The tram is very convenient to get to other nearby hotels.

If you look around, you will be able to find great deals especially if you check in Sunday or Monday instead of Friday or Saturdays.  The food at restaurants are really good, only a bit pricy.  If you like the value deal, try weekday breakfast or lunch at the buffet.  they are basically the same price as sandwiches they sell at the cafes here.

the fitness center is really pretty and nice too.

the only surprise I found was when you move anything in the refrigerator, it automatically charges you.  Supposedly they let you borrow a refrigerator if you ask, I never have though.  There is a guy who brings a cart around everyday and checks mini-bar to see if you need refilling.  Make sure you place back the drinks in there before this guy comes in if you dont want to be charged.Vdara is 1 of my favorite hotels in Vegas!  I love their suite amenities - mainly the separate spaces for living room & kitchen.  Having a kitchen definitely comes in handy especially for those late night cravings and drinks.  The bar comes fully stocked and the fridge has plenty of space for leftovers or even more drinks. 

Little things that went a long way -
* plush robes
* luxurious pillows
* push-button housekeeping
* aveda products
* veuve clicquot
* spacious bathroom
* blackout shades and sheer curtains
* personalized on-screen tv guide

Vdara is clean, relaxing, smoke-free, and I absolutely loved the location.  There's a direct walkway (inside the hotel) that connects to Bellagio. And if you step outside of the hotel and walk to your left you're instantly at Aria and City Center. We never had to wait for a cab unlike other hotels.  Vdara is an escape from the typical crazy casino hotels.  When I'm ready to call it a night (or I guess morning in some cases) I like to walk into a quiet area with direct access to the elevator.  Every time we stayed at a casino hotel I was always annoyed to walk through a casino filled with smoke, belligerent drunks, and people checking-in and out w/their hefty rolling luggage. I just want sleep... please get out of my way!! ;)

Check-In and Check-Out process = 5 stars
Bar = 5 stars
Decor = 5 stars
Bellman & Staff Service = 5 starsThe Vdara was contemporary and elegant. I had an excellent stay at this hotel the staff was friendly. I loved not having a casino in the hotel itself. Refreshing and beautiful! The Cafe downstairs had great food and it's right across the street from the Cosmo if you want to go to the pool party! I would stay again.WOW! This place is yummy! Try the Dynomite and Cinderella roll, so good. 

The music isn't too good but not enough where it bugs me. Sevice is alright nothing to great, as long as they get me my food and serve me my drink I am happy. DELICIOUS!I'm sorry to read all the bad reviews, because we couldn't have enjoyed our meal there more.  Our waiter was a doll (wish I could remember his name). Drinks and food all arrived in a timely manner, the food was fresh and hot. LOVED the Alligator bites to start off with. The pastas were all tasty and spicy.  The prices are on the high side, but fortunately we used a Groupon.We love Cajun country and visit when we can.  We saw a Groupon for Rhythm Kitchen and thought we should give it a try as we were craving some good Louisiana style food.  What we had was excellent so we went back.

Visited twice in the last week, once for Happy Hour and once for dinner.  We found both to be excellent and the Happy Hour is VERY reasonable.  For dinner we had the Shrimp Creole and Salmon and they were tasty, the Creole had a very nice rich flavor.  The Happy hour allowed us to sample their Shrimp Brochette (super) Beef Tips, Wings, and Pizza were all tasty.  Drinks at $3 including wine and Draft Beer.  We will be back.

Service was good as well and the employees friendly and helpful without being overbearing.  BTW, try the Key Lime Pie!  Should add that it is beyond me how anyone would rate this place less than a 4.This is a kid friendly chill out cafe with lots of the same food that Anna offered at the Downtown Market. We're so glad to have this restaurant in downtown with great choices for breakfast, lunch, or an early dinner.

My son's favorite is the Gypsy Stew, a wonderful blend of fresh vegetables, squash, and garbanzo beans. The panini sandwiches and quesadillas are also a big hit. We're looking forward to trying one her new breakfast menu items on our next visit.can never get tired of it! so pretty!..
on the hour every hour.Pretty Spectacular especially since its Free!  Honestly it would be easy to go broke while visiting Vegas if you're not careful...but this fountain show is FREE.  Of course, if you have to walk to it from any distance you will be subjected to people from all walks of life trying to sell you something, but it is worth the trek.  I really love when they play the song "God Bless the USA".  It always brings a tear to my eye.

5 Stars!Best casino buffet in Las Vegas because of the following reasons:

- under $30 for a seafood buffet
- includes unlimited wine and beer
- quality was not sacrificed for quantity
- cold and hot crab legs
- oysters
- excellent pad thai (for a buffet)
- good beef stroganoff 
- the sushi is decent
- chocolate molten cake IS TO DIE FOR
- creme brulee was well-done (for a buffet)
- an assortment of tasty gelato
- good layout with floor to ceiling windows facing The Strip

Definitely worth the $35 cab ride followed by a 45 minute wait.The best seafood buffer in Vegas! They have about 250 choices. All you can eat, snow crab leg, fresh oyster, prime rib, sushi, chinese, italian, thai and other kinds of cuisines. Free tap beer and wine behind the counter ($1 tip would be nice). Make sure to try their dessert and ice cream bar which are separated from the main dining area. The waitress was really friendly, who showed me how to cut the snow crab leg in a efficient way :) It did get crowded during peak hour for lunch/dinner. So make sure you get in line early. The location is a concern but if you have a car, you will be fine.BEST PLACE EVER! the only thing that sucks is that it's off the strip. Food was AWESOME! super duper good! ALL YOU CAN DRINK?! They have coors, root beer on draft, hard cider, champagne, red wine, chardonnay, sweet wine, and warfensteiner.

SCCOOOP THE CONE! Lots of ICE CREAM! i should have saved room for MORE ice cream, but I just drank a TON of boooooze.

WILL GO AGAIN FOR SURE!Coffee on the porch or in the garden, Bergies is an eclectic house close to 100 years old turned into one of the best coffee houses in the valley of the sun.  Located in downtown Gilbert, just up the street from the Water Tower.  World wide beans roasted daily and fresh from all over the world, at far better pricing than national chains. Brian and Bruce (Bothers) have roasting down to a science, and no bean is ever sold older than 14 days from roast date.  So as they say "Catch your Buzz at Bergies" You will be so happy you did!

They also have great live music on Saturday nightsWe live around the corner from the Red Bird Cafe and would probably eat there every day...if we could avoid hitting 400lbs. 
Everything we've tried on the menu is amazing! Breakfast and lunch are delicious, with daily specials. The bacon blue cheese burger is to die for! A family from Wisconsin owns and operates the restaurant--and they're always nice. 
You always leave satisfied!You know after listening to the music last nite late 60's/70's. It would be really cool if they could add some brownies to the desert menu, everyone would be feeling fine...and their profits would soar!!!Love love LOVE this place! The owner is always there, the staff is super friendly and the food is delish! We've been going there since they opened and are never disappointed! The owner is very personable and he even hooked me up with a free slice of cheesecake on my birthday.Me and my husband come every Friday night for seafood night because $20 for all you can eat crab is a great price considering how fresh it always is! And their ice cream bar has about 10 different flavors of scooped ice cream and  they are delicious!After a failed tire rotation and repair at Purrfect Auto Service down the street, I went here and they were great.  I had a low right rear tire and when I went to the other place asked them to rotate my tires and repair the low one.  They said, no tire repair was needed and that they rotated my tires.  Two weeks later the same tire was low in the same location.  Went to Discount Tire and they agreed the other place hadn't rotated them and that the tire had a small nail.  Both were taken care of and I was on my way in 45 minutes.  Thanks,This is by far the BEST sushi restaurant I've ever gone to.  The Volcano, unbelievable.Awesome local products and produce. My new favorite grocery store!I love the Skullpt classes (haven't tried yoga). Their regular-priced Skullpt classes are too expensive for me at $17, but their weekday "matinée" special for $7 for any Skullpt class from 9am to 12pm is amazing ($5 yoga). I go to Skullpt Mat during my lunch hour on Tuesdays and Skullpt Barre during my lunch hour on Thursdays. They often start and end a few minutes late, FYI. This is not an easy class, so push yourself but don't hesitate to sit a couple of moves/sets out. 

My one complaint is that the room starts to get very hot and it's hard to breathe about halfway through the class. I wish they would keep the temperature around 77 instead of 83 in a small room where 6-9 women are exerting themselves at 100%. That said, the instructors always turn down the air when I ask and it makes a world of difference.This place is a total godsend!  I just got the best Brazilian wax here.  It was completely painless and Nicole was a total sweetheart.  The wax took about 15-20 minutes and I only cringed during one part.  That should sum up how great they are.

They have this special wax that is a deep purple and works wonders.  Definitely something new and amazing!  This place is worth the drive and probably the only professional waxing salon where you can get a Brazilian for $35!  $13 for AZ residents, but I'm from CA so I missed out.  This has officially become my go to wax spot!A few months ago our favorite Chinese food restaurant went out of business [sniff]. My husband and I were devastated! Ok, that's a little dramatic... but we needed to find a place from where we could get our Chinese food fix! We got online, ran a search on Yelp for "Chinese food," read countless reviews on various restaurants, and finally settled on Dragon Express. It was out of our way to drive to Alma School/Baseline but we were willing to make the sacrifice. Upon arriving to the restaurant I was immediately impressed. The atmosphere was so welcoming and unlike any Chinese food restaurant I had been to! There were pictures of all the food making it simple to choose what you wanted, the dining area was clean, and the cashier/waitress was SO FRIENDLY! She immediately brought my kids snacks to eat while we waited. It's my opinion you can tell the quality of a good Chinese food restaurant by their egg roll, so needless to say we ordered egg rolls. Not only was the presentation appetizing, their freshness and taste is unmatched to any other egg roll I've ever tasted. AND to top it off the Sweet & Sour Chili dipping sauce is incredible! I ordered Beef Lo Mein and my husband ordered the Orange Chicken; both were absolutely delish! We were so impressed by our first experience that we've been back twice! Each time we try something different and have yet to try something we don't like! Keep this place in business and eat there often! You won't be disappointed! Thank you Yelp for helping us find our new FAVORITE Chinese food restaurant!I love this place! I have been to this establishment many times to eat and it keeps getting better. I totally know why this place was on the top 10 downtown dining review from Howard Steffel. On my last visit to Moira I had the Hamachi Cheek which was phenomenal. The head chef made me a cucumber roll that had everyone at my table wanting to to try it and they couldn't say enough about how flavorful the roll was. I also had the rainbow roll and the caterpillar roll which was a big success with my seven year old niece who is new to the sushi world also, I would like to add that both rolls were great. Moira also offers great bottled beverages my niece loved the japanese soda and I'm a big fan of the bottled teas they offer.  sexy, and fresh....Im completely loving Moira's decor its totally modern.
and I can't help but address some complaning yelpers

If you want quality.... well, then you have to pay for quality:-) Unless, you go to happy hour then you get the deals. Moira's rolls are made with the freshest ingredients you can often run into the main chef picking up items from the locally grown markets in phoenix before and during his lunch hour to make sure he has the best product for his customers. 

Also, the Harry Bertoia's Wire Chairs you guys talk so much of...I happen to love the art but  the word is they are redesigning a new pad for the bottom of the seat.  So all of you people that are rocking the caucausian long board and don't have enough cushion for the pushin are in luck. I just hope it doesn't ruin the look of moira's cool chairs. 


With all that said I love moira and the great sushi chefs they always have me leaving with a smile:-)Pizghetti is AMAZING!Ask for Joey the bartender he is official!Anne, I can't even imagine I visited the same place as you did-I found them very friendly and my lunch was just great today.  Though I'll give you the 'Panini' moniker is misleading, and the pita is likely not what most people are used to.  This place is definitley worth a visit though!!

I recently found out my favorite lepinja bread at Asiana Market (43rd Ave/Union Hills) was baked here, and I was counting the milliseconds until I could visit this place.  Seriously-best bread I have EVER eaten and I've eaten LOTS of bread.  It is a pillow of wonderfulness reserved only for the most discriminating carbo-holics :)

So, me and a buddy split the small beef sausage sandwich with the above mentioned killer bread, onions and a buttery/creamy condiment spread.  We are both foodies (though Bosnian food wouldn't be something we'd call familiar) and we couldn't quite nail down what this was.  Except darn tasty!  I'd call a mix between whipped butter and sour cream?  HELLLLLLLLLLLLLOOOOOOOOOOOOO!??!?!

 I can't imagine a person actually being able to eat the whole thing by themselves, but we both loved our lunch-and a $5 price tag makes it even more appealing.

I will DEFINITELY be back.  They get the five-star fame just for their awesome bread!  Please bury me with a coffin full when I'm dead :)Great Frozen Yogurt! You get a lot of Ice Cream for your money! If you are into the pumpkin flavored holiday season then definitely try the Pumpkin Pie flavor.

We went in here around 9:30 at night and the girl working was really nice and patient with us. It was our first time so we were kinda slow. I got a small Pumpkin Pie with graham and coconut. It was delicious! Perfect texture didn't taste overly cold like some places do. It was very creamy and smooth.

Recommend this place to everyone. Must try at least once.Took a couple minutes to get our chipotle burgers, but they were delicious. Sweet potato fries were delicious. I regret not including any pastrami as a part if the meal, but the burger was all I could handle. I'll just have to come back for some pastrami next time I'm in Vegas.Excellent Trailhead into the Superstition Wildernesss if you want to get away from people quickly. After 3 miles we saw no other people until the next morning, 9 miles away.

Showers at the marina public restroom are not the highest quality, but after a few days in the wilderness it was like a spa. March to Mid-April and October to November are most recommended for having water sources available.These guys are top-notch pros.  We just had our home painted (interior), and after the move, not one scratch on a wall.  They work hard and quickly.  Reasonably priced, I will use again & recommend to people in NE Scottsdale!Two dozen times eating and never a bad visit! Green chili fries very good!! The beer is always cold , staff always friendly and remember you if you become a regular. The place is a little small so if you see a table you better grab it. Don't be in a rush to get your food because nothing is pre made. So have a drink enjoy your company or make a new friend.I love this place. The food is clearly made with love and the folks there are so inviting and warm.  Great vibe. Great food. Great price. You can bet the next time I visit Phoenix, I'll be coming back to Tiny's ;)This place is phenomenal!! I think im addicted to the filet!!! :)I feel like I have just been slapped in the face with my five a day. 

I popped in to check out the newly refurbished Hula Juice bar today with a friend of mine. It looks great - still quirky and cosy but a bit more modern in its stylings. I had a whirling Dervish which was a delight of tangy flavour. My friend had a Ginger something or other which was pretty good I think - well she didn't let me have any so I assume that it was good! 

Anyway this was about my dozenth or more visit to hula and I felt it was time to review it. So although today I only had a smoothie - in the past I've had soups, sandwiches, bagels, cakes and other exciting things!  So the five stars is not just for today but for the whole Hulaexperience. That doesn't really work as one word....
hulexperience.... experihula....
,,,,,,,,Stopped for lunch...great service..The food was scrumptious. The ziti was homemade with sauce like mom makes. Try the Parma sandwich...what an Italian sub should be! We took food home too...Today was my first time at Arcadia Tavern after it was recommended to me by a friend. They said it was a nice place, so I decided to go clear to the other side of Phoenix just to meet someone for lunch and try it out.

And I have to say...

My guest and I were pleasantly greeted, and taken care of really well. :-) 5 out of 5 stars.

The blonde waitress there named Alli is one of the best servers I've ever had wait on me in the last 15 years.

The food was good, the atmosphere was pleasant (went during lunch today/wednesday afternoon around 3pm), and the price was as expected...but the service was outstanding and I made sure the tip reflected it. Well deserved.

The waitress was prompt, friendly, courteous, professional, kind, and very welcoming. It was more like going to an enjoyable event by the end than a regular visit to a restaurant, and I really liked that feeling. It was very comfortable.

The first impression is always the strongest and most lasting. For some it is good, for others not depending on the day and people I'm sure...but from the cook to the hospitality, everything was stellar today.

Thanks to the staff at Arcadia and to Alli for making it such a nice day there. Will definitely be back with others, and highly recommend.This place is unreal! When the pizza comes out of the oven it looks like a piece of art. Looks so good you want to devour it but then again you just want to look at it and admire it. To start off we had the cauliflower and I hesitated on getting it cause I cant stand the stuff but oh my god I love it now. Also we had the margarita pizza. Um yeah DELISH! Im going to get the Salsiccia on my next visit. And we had to try a pasta so we had the Pappardelle Bolognese. Again it was great. The pasta is made fresh in house and you can tell. We ate so much we had no room for dessert but next time I will. I have made it a point to go here once a week. I want to try everything they have on the menu. Prices are great. All that and two beers $32. Like I said this place is a must. Just look at the pics and you will see what Im talkin about. This is my new favorite place. The inside is simple and clean.  The staff are all very friendly. Our waiter was Steve. Tall guy you cany miss him. If you get him as your server you are in luck. He knows everything about all the dishes and is very helpful. Check this place out you will not be disappointed.all their pizzas are unique and tasty!

lots of photo ops inside a former hair salon place!Outstanding service, Prakash is Awesome!! Food is delicious, I traveled all the way from Green Valley, Henderson to have the sumptuous buffet. Great Food, Great People.THE BEST sushi I have had in a very long time..... being from California, I'm super snobby with my sushi...this pace looks like a total hole in the wall from the outside, but the food is amazing! The fish is fresh, and melts in your mouth, the rolls are enormous, even the cooked items are great! My toddler is super picky about what he eats, and usually never eats teriyaki bowls when we order for him, but from here, he couldn't have enough. We eat here a few times a month.For those seriously considering dining here, I wouldn't pay much attention to Jessica E. over there complaining about being served shrimp with the heads on- that's one heck of a  faux pas (they're more flavorful and tender cooked that way, Jessica... And yes, it is a well known cooking technique for prawnes in Asia, it's just not commonplace in the states.) 

I had an amazing meal at American Fish during opening week. My husband and I ordered the tuna tartare, shrimp and grits, tasmanian ocean trout baked in sea salt, wood grilled & smoked mixed grill, malt vinegar French fries, caramelized cauliflower and truffle gratin and the coconut pearls. While I enjoy sashimi on a regular basis, I'm not much of a fan of tuna but decided to give the tartare a try- no regrets, it was wonderful. The flavors were light fresh, and the quality of the tuna exceptional. My husband's shrimp and grits were to die for (although I normally don't like grits) and had the perfect amount of spice to compliment the dish. Our entrees were flat out stellar. All seafood was cooked perfectly and masterfully seasoned. The mixed grill had a nice variety of seafood that should please anyone who likes a bit of everything, and the wood grill added the right amount of earthy smokiness. The sea salt baked Tasmanian trout sounded interesting and turned out to be a winner, think salmon but more subtle and silky. The salt baking technique infused a very pleasant amount of saltiness to the fish, but it wasn't overwhelming at all. If you're worried it might be too salty, don't. 

The fries were addictive, and while I agree with Jen. L that the tartar dipping sauce was a little tangy, I really loved the citrus bite of it- but that's just me, your mileage may vary. 

My side dish was the caramelized cauliflower and truffle gratin, it was most certainly enough for two since it was indulgently rich and filling. Between my husband and I we couldn't finish our sides, so the complaint from Jessica that the portions were small is bewildering. In fact my major complaint about Vegas is that the food portions are far too large, and I have nothing but praise for the portion size at MM's American Fish. Am I one of the few who goes out to enjoy a fine meal and doesn't want to feel so stuffed I can't move when it's over? If the portions at American Fish aren't enough it's got nothing to do with the restaurant. If what you're after is gigantic portions of lackluster food, then American Fish is not what you're looking for. 

The coconut pearls were wonderful, if you like cream-sickles this is an interesting spin on the idea. Furthermore, it wasn't puckery sweet, so you could actually taste the delicate flavors. The spoonful of blood orange sorbet on top served as a nice temperature and flavor contrast. 

The service was equally wonderful, the prices very reasonable, we left happy, and to date this has been one of the finest meals I've enjoyed. Keep up the good work Michael Mina! Next time I'm in Vegas I'll look forward to dining here.Had a amazing dining experience.It was my wife's birthday and I wanted to take
her some where special.For appetizers we indulged on the scallop and foie gras with the charred blackberry butter-Pure decadence at its best!!.For entrees we shared the lobster pot pie with brandied truffle cream and the mustard marinated black cod.The pie was carved table side which was a nice touch.Service was friendly and attentive and the server was very knowledgeable and passionate.I can't wait to go back.Fabulous,  extremely personable service.  Every course was excellent,  from the creative cocktails through the luscious desserts.I like reading about food and restaurants...no question about it.

Some of my friends write the best stuff about carne asada, amuse bouche, foie gras and other gastro-porn delights (if there can be gastro-pubs, then there can be gastro-porn).

When my buddy, Hotdish, wrote a glowing review of Sonora Mesquite and their carne asada, I knew that I needed to try it out myself!

Really, it's not like I'm just following Joel around, eating lunch where he eats lunch, having drinks where he has drinks, going to the movies where he goes to the movies...well you get my drift...it's a complete coincidence that I just happen to show up at the same places at the same times!

I follow lots of you around...via Yelp (so you don't need to be too worried that I'll show up at your respective houses).

But you could frankly do worse than to stalk Joel and eat at the places he recommends...the man finds some gems and he really knows his victuals!

So I got the restraining order quashed and headed out to Sonora Mesquite for some of the best food I've had (and I've had some good stuff, believe you me).

I've been back 3 or 4 times since I first dropped by and it's so damn cute...Selena, the owner, greets me like a long lost son every time...and she never remembers that I've been in before!

That cracks me up!

Selena is like my wise Latina mom (well, except for the fact she's younger than I am...and I'm not really as Latin as I look in my profile picture)...she is so sweet!

And...she makes everything from the carne asada and barbacoa to the charro beans, salsa and guacamole, herself...fresh...from scratch...every day (BTW, the folks at the Mission need to drop by and get a Guacamole making and pricing lesson from Selena...$1.50 for the same size side of guac that costs $15.00 at Mission...and isn't as good...maybe you're paying to watch it made at Mission).

It's hard for me to recommend any one thing...the taco's are sublime, the quesa's are wonderful, the charro beans and rice are among the best in town...the carne asada is (as Joel testified) some of the best around...in short...Sonora Mesquite is a wonderful little find...and heavily in the current lunchtime, retox rotation.

Drop by, say "hola!" to Selena and have a taco or a quesadilla...tell her I sent you...she won't remember who the hell I am, but that's OK...she'll treat you like family anyway!I have been to First Food and Bar with large parties (8 or more) of "foodies" three times now. What a fun place! The food has been amazing each time. I suppose you can call it upscale American bar food...a fun gastropub. Chef Sammy D (Demarco) takes traditional (comfort food) fare and makes it unique. This past visit I was knocked out by the Pumpkin Ravioli, the Short Ribs and Blackened Skirt Stake, the Frito Pie (chili), three fresh fish dishes (our party shared all of the dishes) and the Dirt Pie dessert was extraordinary. This visit I noticed that the bar menu had expanded to include dozens of great craft, regional and micro beers from all over the world. The menu even offered pairing suggestions.

My wife and I have sent many people to First for special events and private parties. There is always a great DJ and a video bar.

Very good service and prices that are significantly lower than comparable Las Vegas Strip restaurants. A gem.The food here is terrific. Brad did an incredible job as the server tonight keeping us filled up on drinks and clearing our table. The manager Glen was incredible checking on our table throughout the meal. This is definitely the place to go!!!I work just around the corner from this location and last night I had to give it a try.  I've only had gelato one other time so to me this was a new experience.  I loved it.  The staff was wonderful and gave us a brief history of how the gelato is made.  I had a taste of my husband chocolate oreo and it was so YUMMY!  I decided on their tropical surprise and it was Yummy too.  They make their Gelato daily so you know it's fresh.   I'm going back as often as I can.Everything I've had here has been good, but the absolute best thing is the Nem Khao Tod (LS7). It's actually a shame it's so good because I'd like to try more of the menu, but I can never resist ordering the Nem Khao Tod. Seriously, it's like an explosion of a million different delicious flavors in your mouth at once. So effing good.I have a 17month old taking this swimming class. She is having major stranger anxiety and screams for the entire 10 min of the lesson. The only saving grace really is the teacher, Becky. She is excellent with her. She is experienced and calming yet productive. 

The class is short in duration, but appropriatly structured. It goes every day of the week for 5-7 weeks.  We are lucky to have class 5 min from the house! 

The other parents I have talked to are very pleased with their lessons and say that it will get better for my 17month old!OMG!!!! That is best to describe the birthday cake that Lady Diane made for
my really good friends 50th birthday celebration. It surpassed my expectations.
It was so beautiful we hated to cut through it and talk about delicious, it was
white cake with fresh strawberry's and I selected an Italian butter cream
frosting, which I wasn't to sure of because I thought it was going to be to 
sweet, but Lady Diane let me taste it and it was so creamy with the consistency
of whip cream ( it was good).  I rely on internet ratings to choose my vendors
and this place needs to be recognized. I promise you will not be disappointed!

Awesome customer service by the way.I only like to review places that are either really good or really bad and I'm happy to say this one is really good.  I've been to many of the Mr. Goodcent's locations around the valley and this one always seems to be the best.  It's the cleanest and always has friendly employees.  Even though I don't really like chain restaurants, this is a franchise that appears to be owned by a couple so I like being able to support a local business/family. 

There isn't anything fancy about them but I like their large selections of veggies and dressings.  Today I overheard an employee telling one of the owners that they finished making the spicy ranch and I was pleased to see they made it and didn't buy it.  The bread is super fresh and yummy, which is probably the best part!!!    

I got a 12" cheese and veggie sub and a medium drink for the same cost as a 12" sub and drink from Subway.  This tasted a lot fresher and was so much better!  Not sure why some reviews said they are more expensive than Subway.  

BTW- they give punch cards so for every 9 (or is it 10?) sandwiches you buy, you get one free.  Maybe not a big deal but when you eat sandwiches often, it's a nice little bonus to get rewarded for loyalty.Great show. Definitely recommended. This is (almost) word-for-word like the Disney movie, but they add a few more musical pieces to spice it up. 

Yes- it was LONG. I have a pretty long attention span for shows/movies but thank god for the intermission because too much of even a good thing can get...u know. 

Rafiki did an excellent job! Def. my favorite performer of the night.I got my nails done by Kamille & I love them! Best nails I have ever had :) It was my 26th birthday and I wanted to get a little crazy with my nails so I decided to go to the Nail Shoppe and see Kamille. She got me right in and it was awesome! I have been to a few places closer to my home and I can say I have no problem driving a little extra for an amazing set of nails. Definitely the only place I will be going from now on! Thanks again Kamille at the Nail Shoppe!Every time I go to vegas I go threw this company...AMAZING,FUN,EASY!!!!!1st to Review? @IN_N_OUT_Burger! Located near Sunset station & Galleria Mall this place is hopping!

15 cars in the drive-thru @ 2 pm. BUT anyone who's eaten at In & Out KNOWS -It's always worth the wait.

One of these days I'm gonna order a 10x10 and see how long it takes to finish it!

Today however I went for the Double-Double Extra Pickles & Onion with sauce. My Usual!

Fantastic down to the last crumb of bun!

I hear there are now 7 locations throughout the valley-we could do with 10 more or the nice catering truck they have at In-N-Out!There are many things I miss about not living in Edinburgh anymore, and Henderson's has to be right at the top of that list.  The food is usually good, often excellent, and the prices are far from unreasonable.  I have to say I prefer eating in the Bistro rather than the main restaurant downstairs as it has a warmer atmosphere, though you're paying a little more for your meal there.

The best part about it is that there is enough variety and flavour to please most non-vegetarians.  I've taken my mother and sisters there, my mother-in-law and my father, all of whom love their meat, but they've enjoyed the food.  Yes, I'm sure they would have preferred a nice steak, but while they might have gone in there a little apprehensive they came out satisfied and with no reservations about returning.

The shop is a little pricy, but let's face it, if you're vegetarian or vegan you're penalised wherever you go.  If you don't want to eat meat but still want a varied diet, you're going to have to pay for it.  The prices are comparable, or even cheaper, than the other main vegetarian stores in the city and the quality is always excellent.

This place holds a special place in my heart as it is where I took my wife for our first proper date, where I proposed to her and where we had our wedding reception, but that doesn't blind me to its imperfections.  Getting down the stairs to the toilets from the Bistro is a nerve-wracking experience, the main restaurant downstairs is often crowded and sometimes the staff can be a little hit and miss, particularly the younger workers.  However, its imperfections are far outweighed by the quality of the food and the general ambiance.I love that Yogurtland added whipped cream to the selection of toppings and that they have maraschino cherries with stems that I can tie into knots with my tongue.Just recently had another massage here and I have to say, it was even more amazing than last time! The zen garden is incredible and Katherine has magical hands. I can't say enough great things about this place. If you're looking to get pampered in a serene environment, I highly recommend this lovely establishment.I really enjoy the food here. Probably one of the best layouts for a fast food but it feels more homey than any fast food. The service is very hands on, extremely well maintained facility, the best playroom ever and the food is great. If you watch your diet, the salads are great. I am willing to pay a higher price for food when the service and product is his good.I got my tattoo done at Lady Luck back at the end of November, and I can't believe I've forgotten to sing their praises until now!

My husband surprised me with an appointment for my birthday and they got pretty booked in December, so I had my appointment a couple weeks before my actual birthday.

The location is right off the street in Downtown Phoenix right off of the street, so you will most likely park right outside the door. I'm not sure if there was parking at the back of the building. We came at night, so we didn't have to worry about troublesome parallel parking, just pulled right up.

As we went in our artist, Heather, was finishing up with a customer right before us. I think we waited about 15-20 minutes. Not a big deal since we brought dinner, and understood that appointment times can be approx. since you never know what could consume your time completing a design.

Heather already had my design and ready to sketch onto my body. She was very careful about placement, even had me check in the mirror to make sure that I was comfortable with what was going to be showing. 

She was so sterile! (in the best way). My husband even commented that it was the cleanest shop he had been into and that she was so clean and careful with all of her instuments/tools. And for our convenience she had places to put your phone and a TV in case you wanted to put in a movie. We didn't need it since the three of us were so chatty. Heather has such a great sense of humor and her conversation definitely distracted me from any pain I was experiencing. 

My 4x4" tattoo was done in a manner of a simple 45 minutes and the price was lower than we estimated. That's always a great surprise! We were also told that a touch up was free.

Heather was fantastic and I will only be getting my tattoos from her, she's never allowed to move! My tat is gorgeous and have gotten several compliments on how precise it looks.Outstanding experience.  Great food and ambiance and the food presentation ws also great.  The wine list is lacking in great Italian wine.  Many of the wine prices are unreasonibly high.  Monsanto $60, with a wholesale of +-$15, Antinori Santa Cristina $60, with a wholesale of under $10 and can be purchased online for under $10 at the wine library.My wife and I went here on our bi-weekly date night a few months ago. I da just gotten back from France and was still feeling good about my culinary experience. 

I was a little hesitant at first to believe that an American place could match the flavors that I enjoyed, oh so much, while in Paris. However, Petite Maison far exceeded my expectations. I had the dry vac'd steak (I don't remember what it was called, but it was the special of the day) and it was "Holy Shit" good! 

After dinner, we had some cheese and a glass of wine. The cheese was amazing. They had all sorts of choices to chose from. We had the sampler, so we were able to taste something like 6 different cheeses.

If you have $75+ and want to have a great meal with your significant other, go to Petite Maison. You WILL NOT be disappointed.  

My only complaint was that my meal had to end...Love this place. I have only been here one time and it is awesome. The chicken had a little bit too much fat under the friend skin but that was beside me. The waffle was amaaaazing it had almost like a cinnamon-y taste to it. The waffle had a huge glob of butter on it which was not too pleasing to me since I am not a huge fan of butter but taking it off and putting it to the side of my plate was no problem at all. The kool-aid in the mason jars are super cute and unique and I definitely want to go back to try all of the other kool-aid flavors.Yet again I'll say it... This is THE Vietnamese restaurant for me in Phoenix! The food and the prices are still amazing. You can leave completely stuffed for under $10 every single time you eat here, and you don't have to order the same thing every time! There are plenty of well-priced dishes on the menu. 

The thing on my mind that has to be mentioned though is their expansion. They have doubled the size of their dining room, and I couldn't be happier! Now Pho Thanh has plenty of space for all of its patrons to enjoy a hot bowl of the best beef pho in the valley! 

If you still haven't gone here, change that immediately.The service here is bad, they don't care to give you a refill, or even smile. Bathrooms aren't clean... Blah blah.. Despite this, Still gets 5 stars because the PHO is that dang good, and the spring rolls are a must. Come, get... It.My billing issue has been fixed. I've had minor issues with gift cards being applied, but they resolved them once I pressed.

I've been a regular for awhile now and they recognize me by name. 

Only drawback now is I wish they offered specials and that my regular masseuse had more hours!My daughter has been going to the Child Development Center for 3 years now.  I would NEVER think about going anywhere else.  Staff has become family- as matter of fact when I recently had back surgery my daughter stayed with her teacher, FOR FOUR DAYS- over the weekend!!  She has had the same primary teacher since she was 3 months old.  They do what is called "looping" - which is when you child basically takes their teacher with them as they move up through the classes.  My daughter has had many of the same friends since she was 3 months old also.  Kids don't leave much.  Usually daycares are fairly transient- in both kids and teachers.  I have seen minimal turnover in the staff (which speaks volumes) and very little in the children also.  As matter of fact most kids only leave for kindergarten or if the family is moving out of state!  I absolutely love everyone there and couldn't be happier with my daughters care.I'm forever in search of my "dream handyman" and now I think I've found him (knock on the wood). After several years of disappointing experiences with handymen, I started to believe that there is no such thing as a good handyman.  Thanks to Yelp (and "no" this is not a advertisement for Yelp) I'm hopeful that I've finally found my "go to" man for repairs big and small. I called Troy in a time of desperation, needing to get several repairs to my home before my renters moved in.  He arrived in the morning, worked for eight straight hours, and checked off everything on my list.  When I discovered a few more things, he returned within a few days, and finished those jobs as well. Troy seems committed to saving clients money whenever possible ... based on my experience with him. He bills hourly, works fast and his rate is reasonable. Based on his service, and all of his positive reviews on Yelp, I'm sure Troy must be a very busy handyman, but somehow he still made me feel like a "preferred" client.  I rarely post reviews on Yelp, but in this case, a rave review is definitely in order.  Thanks Troy!What a great experience - and a great value for the minimal cost! 
This was my 2nd visit to the Paul Mitchell School Salon. 
My first visit was in January for a deep conditioning and trim. They did a great job, and the tranquil shampoo room was comparable to a high end spa/salon. 
For my 2nd visit this past Saturday, I went for the works: foil highlights, deep Awapuhi conditioning treatment, significant cut (new style) and blow out. Four hours later I left the salon looking, and feeling like $1m bucks and 10 years younger  :-)  

Chris was my student stylist this time. About 30 minutes into the service he confessed to me that I was his very first "live" client. I could see he was nervous when he first started to work on me, but he had great support form another more seasoned student, as well as the instructor who stopped by periodically to check on his work and offer suggestions. as we reached the blow out stage, his confidence increased, and by the end I could see his joy and pride in his finished product!
He really did a great job, and 2 days later, at work today, I am getting one compliment after another! 

Please don't expect a quick / fast appointment; they take their time and as I said, I was there for over four hours (I arrived for a 10am appt on a Saturday, and left shortly after 3pm).
It's worth your time though because the atmosphere is very nice and it's a great way to relax and enjoy the experience! And all for an unbelievably low price. My total for the "works" was only $64! (Compared to $300 or more at a salon)The best view. 

Drink menu has a lot of great selections. I had the non-alcoholic cucumber watermelon drink; which was godly. So if you have ever wondered what your Cucumber Melon Bath and Body Works lotion tastes like, then you should have that. 

The staff was friendly, and attentive to your needs. The mood here was intimate and romantic. I really liked the assortment of spicy nuts they give you when you sit down. Watch out for the green ones, those will burn your ass.Had a great experience at this particular Hard Rock.  I always get the Twisted Mac and Cheese with Chicken. It was super tasty as always.  The server even recommended some ways to customize the dish if we wanted to change it up a bit.  Our drinks were always full, the bathrooms were very clean.  My favorite part of the whole dining experience was that we sat on the patio overlooking the strip.  The layout of this particular Hard Rock is fantastic, and we received outstanding service!  You can't go wrong here.I have been frequenting this spot since they opened and have always said they were better than Starbucks but Iam in a special kind of heaven after the change in menu and addition of pressed tea lattes!!! Yum, yum, yum!!! Far better than Starbucks powdered green tea latte and roughly a dollar cheaper than the high priced cup there as well. The early morning staff is great and free WiFi is an added bonus. I can honestly say for the New Year, I'm quitting you Starbucks......and mean it.Pei Wei is one of my favorite restaurants.  They have a good selection of food and their prices are decent.  Their food is fresh and so far I've liked everything I've tried.  They have a great kids menu, too.  This location is clean and has quick service.  The staff are friendly, too.Great soul food.  I rolled by and picked up the fried chicken "to-go".  I got home and it was soooo good.  Perfectly seasoned and spiced.

The food took a little long to cook (about 20 min) for a call in order but well worth it.  The staff was very helpful and attentive.  

Unfortunately, they only honor a military discount with the combo plates and not individual items.  Looks like ill have to roll by for a combo plate and try the catfish.Hands down best soul food joint I've had yet. There are still a couple I haven't tried in Vegas. So as of now this place takes the lead!

They are voted "Best soul food restaurant in Las Vegas" and they do live up to that reputation. When you first walk in, it's kind of small but had a homey comfy feel. The ladies there were very warm and welcoming. Advising us we can take a seat where ever we feel comfortable. Service was excellent. Someone came and got our drinks and order real quick.

I ordered the smothered chicken, white meat. It comes with 3 sides & also cornbread. I got -- mashed potatoes, greens, & Mac n cheese. And oh my goodness. The mashed potatoes were one of the best I ever had. Idk what they put in it but it was so creamy and the gravy accented the mashed potatoes just right. The greens were pretty alright, nothing special about them though. Mac n cheese was da bomb! It had just the right amount of cheesiness. Now let me tell you about the chicken! The chicken was perfection. Even tho it was fried, it wasn't dry, it was so moist! I do recommend getting the white meat instead of dark because it does make a difference on the taste. 

The beau got the chicken and waffles. It doesn't come with sides but it does come with 3 chicken wings, eggs (your choice of how it's cooked) & comes with corn bread as well. The portions are large so he could barely finish his 3rd chicken. He loved and thought the chicken was delicious as well. 

I'm impressed with this restaurant & will probably return when I need a little Soul in me. LolNew owners... A true Mom and Pop cafe.   I had the crunchy French toast which was fabulous and my husband had the pastrami burger which was outstanding.  Decor is warm, friendly and welcoming just like the service.
Off the beaten track but worth finding.The Caves are an intensely amazing experience. Usually open for very special events (notably for Fringe shows), the Caves have a very exclusive feel since you know you can't experience them on just any old night of the week.

Floodlit, dingy and occasionally dripping with water, the Caves are in actual fact very well kept and have bars etc inside. You feel like you're in a swanky bunker, or burrowing into a secret underground society, but whatever it feels like it's damn good.

I saw a cracking show in here a few years back called "24 Ways To Die". It was an amazing performance executed by a fantastically flamboyant cast, but The Caves definitely heightened the experience and lend to it being more memorable. I wish they were open all year round, but maybe that would detract from their appeal. They serve us well as a secret annual portal to another realm.I absolutely love going into Poor Little Rich Girl. The staff are incredibly friendly and they are all so helpful. A nice feature they have is to search for things in the store for you, so you don't have to do it! I don't know of one other resale store that will do that! It's incredible. They also have some of the best hand-crafted, locally made jewelry I've seen. I've recently bought severeal necklaces, earrings and gifts from them. It's such a great little shop. I tell all my friends to buy and consign there because you won't find nicer or friendlier people anywhere else.Pens pens and more pens!

I came here looking for some ink for a fountain pen I recently purchased online. WOW. I wasn't expecting the incredible selection they had nor the friendly help I received. Donald S says it best... they have everything. Definitely going back!Great price for lunch, and the pad thai was delicious. As a lover of spicy foods, level 8 out of 10 was perfect. It's in the corner of its plaza, making it easy to miss. I'm glad I found this place. My lunch was so delicious that I ordered a panang curry to go.Revo Burrito is my go to local spot.  Lunch meetings for work, not in the mood to cook, after traveling with nothing in the fridge, and my go to for a quick meal with out of town guests.  There are healthy options - whole wheat tortillas, gluten free options, brown rice, vegetarian dishes.  

My favorite is the carne asada bowl with organic black beans, guacamole and peppers.  The portion sizes are good, you will not be hungry (and may have some leftovers).  I also like the old fashion lemonade made with Stevia. Tart and refreshing! Hurray and thanks to Revo Burrito for providing clean eaters with healthy and tasty meal options!Better than Chipotle? Si! I was very impressed with this place. Not only was the chicken fajita burrito delicious, the prices were very reasonable, and the staff is exceptionally kind. They give you complimentary chips and salsa while your food is being prepared, a variety of chips and salsas (the verde salsa is muy bueno). Lastly, they make some pretty good lemonade as well. Highly recommended.Sometimes you sacrifice sub-par customer service for great food, and other times you'll settle for sub-par food/drinks for the great customer service and ambience; amazingly you'll get the best of both worlds here. I have had nothing but great experiences every time I have been here and even told myself after my second to last visit that I would leave a positive review, but after tonight's service I made it a priority to leave my input. The service is always very attentive and kind, and the food and drinks selection is to die for. Me and my boyfriend swear by the cajun burger and mac and cheese both, paired with sweet potato fries and regular fries (they'll allow you to split both)--it's the stuff dreams are made of. The cocktails are fantastic in that they have a myriad of fun and exotic options for a reasonable price, yet they make sure not to skimp on the potency; notable selections would the blood orange martini (on the rocks) for a sweet and tart option, or a Scorpion Bowl (large tropical cocktail served in a bowl suitable for 2-4 people with a flaming shot of 151 in the middle) if you're sharing a good time with some friends. Our servers there have always been great, but a special thanks to both Kate and Kyle for consistently exceptional service. Both have truly gone above and beyond to accommodate our needs without batting an eyelash. 

I work in reputation management so I understand the importance of great establishments getting the public praise they deserve. Every restaurant should strive to be like this one--Hula's employees and management, keep doing what you're doing, don't change a thing.I'm down 23lbs since I started amenZone. It's not easy. It's not a miracle. It's hard work and it works, which you know in your heart is what it takes.Darnell did an amazing job!! I came home and found that all of the stains on my carpeting were gone, and the house smelled really clean. I would definitely use Heaven's Best Carpet Cleaning again. 
They were professional, efficient, and Darnell really seemed to enjoy his job. Thanks Darnell!!!Seriously, i hit the mother load when I found McDowell Mountain Animal Hospital! I brought our Bengal in for a second opinion about what could be wrong with her.  Everyone was compassionate to my concerns and took steps I was content with to bring me piece of mind. I drove 20 minutes to come for an appointment but it was truly worth the trip.
Thank you...sincerely.I'm going to up my review for Urban Beans to five stars. The music generally seems to have improved, but more importantly, the weekend brunch offerings are awesome. In addition to a la carte items, UB offers a great multi-course breakfast, with your choice of side, main dish (including custom omelet), coffee and adult beverage (choice of mimosa or bloody mary). I don't remember the exact price but it's around $15 and worth every penny. And, if I'm going to have to be a coffee shop working on Sunday, it's awesome to be able to get a real breakfast and not just a pastry. Highly recommended :)Always cool to come back and stock up on some retro candy and get that sugar rush from the variety of sodas they have here.

Take advantage of their free tastings(Wed.5-8, Sat. 1-3). This place really does make you feel like a kid again...ALOHA!!!

YELP 365 Challenge-(63/365) "Rocket Fuel Sold Here"Not sure why this place has gotten such bad reviews. If their Groupon ploy was to build business, they managed to get a new customer. I live downtown Madison, and can say we don't have any restaurants/bars quite like this. The location is spectacular, the building is light, and the outdoor space is great.

We went for a spaghetti board -- I'm not a spaghetti connoisseur, but I would say that it was quite good! The noodles were cooked perfectly, the sauce tasted good (didn't seem jarred, but I can't be sure), and the meatballs were seasoned and done well. The Italian bread tasted like it had real butter! No complaints about our food.

We ordered drinks at the bar as we waited for our table (they had the chef set it up so that we didn't get us messy; considerate, in my opinion, plus the food was fresh) -- great prices on Turbo Dog! I think it may have been happy hour, but still. Also, service all around was good.

Even if the food/service would have been terrible, I would have come back for the location. Fun experience -- will definitely be back through the summer, especially if there's another pasta board.Eating in is a decent experience, but for delivery, I have yet to meet their match.  When I order delivery I always get a 16" chicken pizza with alfredo sauce on top, and for the last 6 years I have received it in 30 minutes or less all but 2 times.  Its always tasty, fresh, and is my preeminent food for delivery, ever, period.My house was soooo cold so I decided to go here after my first class because I was so hungry, I needed some noodle soup in my system to warm me up. Yeah, I know I live in Arizona. SO?

I guess I went in when it was slow because I was seated as soon as I walked in, the girl waiting on me was ultra work efficient, took my order, got me my drink and before I knew it BAM. Hot steaming bowl of Pho Dac Biet in front of me. I dug right in an decimated that pho bowl.

It was good, and hit the spot. I just wish there was more tendon in the pho, but I'll have to ask if they can just make me a Pho Tai Gan. Coz that's my favorite! And then I'll give them their 5th star. :)

I didn't have too many complaints because I just wanted to be fed and left alone and give me my check when I'm done eating. And they did a good job on their part! I'll be here more often and bringing my family here too. I'm glad there's a vietnamese restaurant closer to my house! Now I won't have to drive 30-45 minutes to other restaurants to get some yummy vietnamese food. Yaaay! 

Can't wait for round 2~

EDIT: 
They do make Pho Tai Gan! You just have to ask for it! :)Love love love these guys! Front of the house is accommodating and most importantly fair. Honest and fair is how I choose to describe them.  Worked on both of my cars and if I have any issues in the future I'm coming back!AMAZING FOOD!!! Great hostesses, HORRIBLE WAITRESSES!!! Gets five stars even with the poor wait staff. I hope the owner sees these reviews and considers letting go of the bad apples. 

The food is so yummy! It is not typical mexican food, its updated and current- gotta love that!This place is great. I can't believe it's not packed or that we have not discovered it sooner. $10 gets you a flight and a free pint glass to take home. All their beers are smooth and full of flavor. The staff is friendly, informative, and passionate about what they do. Love how close it is to my house and that you can bring in your own food. Can never go wrong with a good beer and can't wait to bring in my friends.Great food, great prices. My favorite is lasagna, one of the Wednesday's items. We also had an occasion to cater from this restaurant and the results were excellent. Their choices of dessert items are excellent as well as the taste and presentation. 

The staff is very friendly and attentive. The noise level is surprisingly low and moderate considering the size of dining area and the number of tables it has.I play blackjack here. The dealers are all very friendly and will to help others while playing. A great atmosphere! I would reccomend this to anyone ib AZ above all others!This is the best salon ever. I had such a wonderful experience here. Between the entire staff making me feel like a friend and the best cut and style, I'll never go anywhere else. 
 Salvador was my stylist for 3 appointments now and he's incredible. He did the cut & style for my friend & I  in a resent shooting of a brand new reality show. Our hair was more impressive than the show. Enough said, just go.After driving by this place numerous times, hubby and I decided to try it. It is a jewel of a sushi bar, unpretentious, and good sushi. We loved the toro, kiss my ass, finding nemo, cave creek, and fresh, raw wasabi. The place was packed (Friday night). Didn't have to wait long and the service was good. I love the fact that it is a neighborhood place, and it usually doesn't look open. I'm glad I went in.They sell endive, dandelion and other super healthy and super good greens for you and very affordable :) however other stuff in there is a little more expensive comparing to other stores in china town ... I'll always have to swing by to buy my green leaves for my smoothies ^_^
They also have a variety of Natto which i like also kelp noodles are a must here very affordable  and good for you if you veganQuickest oil change i have ever had in my life. 
Seriously.
In and freaking out in less than 15min it seemed like.
Decent prices, nice dudes working.
Def repeat customer now.

And, its right down the street from my house...BOOMSCORECANTBETHATThis is, so far, my most favorite ethnic grocery store here in the area! It is clean, well organized, and doesn't smell bad. Their produce is insane, and always fresh and not old. Even the seafood department is good.....I have gotten some excellent clams here for an even better price then anywhere else! They have millions of noodles, seaweed, tofu, whatever your heart desires. I get my Indian spices here as well as my lentils, coconut milk, yuca, and baby bock choi...the list can go on and on! They even have Goya products and our favorite drinks from Puerto Rico. It's fun to try new things too (just descovered almond jelly!) Prices are always great, I always walk out with like 4 bags and having paid only around 30 bucks. I love Mekong!!I discovered this place on my friend's Instagram, but I thought that I'd never try it because a NorCal girl like me wouldn't be in SoCal too often. However, to my luck, it was fate that my Vegas trip brought me here to dine with my girlfriends for a bite. We ordered the Planet Hollywood Dog, the Las Vegas Strip dog, and chili fries.

The chili fries were super crispy and fresh, and definitely one of the best fries I've ever tasted. They were gone instantly among the four of us. I split the Las Vegas Strip Dog with my friend since it had two dogs inside of it, and I never thought I'd be eating guacamole on a hot dog until that day. It was delicious! I have no other words to describe it, but both guacamole and chili were great additions to my hot dog. I haven't tried the Planet Hollywood Dog, but my friends gushed about how great it tasted.

The prices may be expensive for something like a hot dog, but you're paying for the presentation and quality of the hot dog combinations, which are all pretty amazing.My girlfriend and I went to Lola's a few nights ago about 8 p.m.; they close at p.m. Mon-Thursday 10 on Fridays. It was a nice little restaurant with a nice Louisiana / New Orleans atmosphere. I really liked showing up around then, the restaurant had a few others dining in it so overall it was a great quiet dinner with my girl. I ordered a "Fat Tire" beer and she ordered a Riesling, which was a very good wine. 

We Decided on an appetizer of "Hot Crab and Artichoke Dip" served with bagel chips was I thought at first lacking in seasoning, namely pepper, but I let it go and come to find and enjoy the subtly of the flavors we ended up really enjoying this dish.

For an entrée I ordered there "Shrimp and Grits" which were served with smoked Gouda grits and Andouille sausage and mushroom ragout. I have to admit I have never had better grits in my life and I like grits. Eating the grits with some shrimp and sausage all together gave a really great flavor. I used some of the toasted bread they serve to sop up the sauce... Nom Nommy Nom Noms!

My girlfriend ordered the "Shrimp Étouffée" which was also very tasty though I have to say we both loved the shrimp and grits better and she was very envious of my choice. My girlfriend happens to be a "grits Nazi" and she even said they were up there in her book. ~Grins~

To end the meal we shared "Lola's Famous Bread Pudding" and well... It must be this bread pudding rocked. I love bread pudding. It has a nice firm yet moist consistency through and through not like the stuff you get at casinos where the bottoms all soggy and scrambled at the same time. It came covered in a nice rum praline sauce that was just right. The bread pudding part of it had no raisins or chocolate etc... jammed into it, which it to speak for itself and we really enjoyed that.

The server was very nice and fast and it was really nice that the owner and chef "Beth Pokorny" (I looked her name up online) came out to ask us how our meals were and if we were enjoying ourselves. You just do not see this much these days.

Our bill was not bad for everything we enjoyed and overall I think we have a new favorite place in Las Vegas. We will definitely be going there again for my girl's birthday next month and if you have not tried Lola's I would sincerely recommend you give it a try.Definitely delicious!  I have been told to try this place out over and over.  Then it happened!  I checked in on Yelp and noticed Cupcakes A Go Go came up.  What could that mean????  Of course!  I was finally in the neighborhood to try it out.

I am obsessed with banana bread.  I tried their banana cupcake...yum!  It was a whole lot of banana. The custard in the middle was perfect.  The cake was fluffy without being too dense.  The crumble on top was the perfect compliment to the soft cake.  All sorts of delish!

They also have doggie cupcakes.  I think my dog also gave the place a 5-star rating.

I purchased an Oreo cupcake and two peanut butter cupcakes.  I shared the love for these but I can tell you they were well received.  

The counter person was so friendly and informative.  My purchase was quick and easy.  They have to go containers that hold the cupcakes nicely.  No tip overs on the way home!Incredibly done food - very innovative, creative cuisine. Had lunch and dinner here on my last visit to Scottsdale. Real butterscotch for dessert, to die for! Service is also top-notch, the people here make you feel special, you can tell this restaurant is owned and operated by people who really care about their customers and love food. Only wished I lived in Scottsdale so my wife and I could dine here more often.Love these guys! Great service, arrived amazingly fast and took care of me and my car when I was in a car accident this week. Highly recommend them.My rescue Jagger is a Lab mix, and was scared of his own tail when I got him. After just the first few classes I noticed a big difference. Leah gave me lots of good tips to help him at home and when we go out. He is a brand new dog now I can walk right up to people without him trying to bolt. He really knows his commands now. Our training class has helped Jagger and I so much! Thank you Leah!There are times when you need help with your dogs. Leah was there for me and my Bella. She showed me how to handle this mildly aggressive GSD and helped become a better owner. So we both got great training!  I highly recommend Leah and Dog House Training.  Her techniques are easy to understand and work well regardless of the breed. Her style is firm but loving. The perfect combination.I frequent vegas 3 times a year on average and have never had a great beer until I came here. generally crap beer flows freely around vegas but this place steps up the game. unbelievable beer selection, by far the best I have seen in vegas. great taps and rare bottle selection. live music and pool too. what else is there? do yourself a favor and goI was in Vegas for work last week, and for the last night there I brought a coworker with me, we'll call him Mr. K, and explained that this might be the best beer bar he has ever been to.  I know.  I know.  That's a lot of build up.

The receipt said Wendy and Jeff, and if that's accurate, both of them took excellent care of us.  They are funny, friendly, and knowledgeable about beer.  I love them.  OK.  I don't LOVE them love them. I'm not a complete weirdo.

I was the DD so had to select my one drink very carefully.  I believe it was a New Belgium/Lost Abbey collaboration, Brett Beer.    I think this is supposed to be a sour ale, but it's not very sour.  I was calling it a farmhouse ale, but I don't think that's right.  I enjoyed it.  

I don't remember exactly what Mr. K had.  I do know that one of his beers was aged in Wild Turkey barrels and he liked that a lot.

Normally I am in awe of the beer, which is expected, but the food that night.  The food was amazing.  So simple yet so good.  I had the grilled cheese with cheddar, slices of apple, and bacon.  Need I say more?  Yes I do.  I also had the Arrogant Bastard onion rings, and when I forced one upon Mr. K, he said that was the best onion ring he has had in his life.  Yeah.  It's that good.

He ordered a pizza with I think shrooms and sausage and possibly pepperoni.  I forget, but I swiped a piece and it was very good.  The crust is not too thick, not too thin, just perfect.  Delicious with the beer.

Now I remember why my memory is so bad.  We were carbo overloading.  I've been thinking about the beer bites since the last time I was here and we started with those.  Just as good as I remember and I was happy to share since I knew we weren't done yet.

I love this place.  And I mean really love it.Delicious!!
I was in the mood for a burger.. but being a pescatarian makes that a bit of a difficult situation.

So, I ordered the marinated portabello burger from here!  Delicious, and the sweet potato fries were amazing as well.

Would love to come back and try all the bruschettas!In my never ending quest to find a good nail salon, I found the best hands down! They were so nice and took me in quickly. The owner was polite and convinced me to try gel nails and she explained it so well unlike all the others that never have. Hanna applied my gel nails and was so sweet, professional, and careful! They came out looking amazing! I will be going back from now on! They even took their time to know my name! Awesome!I went to Fontana to get skis for my kids. In the past we have gotten equipment from the Hoofer's ski swap and REI, but really loved the experience at Fontana so I will be back next year, when my kids outgrow their equipment again. They did a great job fitting the kids with ski boots and encouraged me to keep skis for my daughter for another year. They have a ski exchange program if your kids outgrow their gear and they bought our used gear.

I use Fontana for fly fishing gear and got cross country skis for myself, and always have a good experience with their knowledgeable staff. I like supporting local businesses, and often expect to pay more to do so, but in the case of skis at Fontana, I got a much better deal than I would have from the alternatives.I can't give this place any less than the max because this is my second home in Vegas.  The time I've spent here can't  compare to any other place I've been to (besides XS).  Im no make-up connoisseur but this place excites me because theres so much to be discovered.  It's well lit, organized, spaced out and inviting!  This store is also filled with ready to help employees, without being overly bearing of course.  I've experience this at other Sephora stores and it's one of my pet peeves.  Since you can easily spend a lot of time in a make-up store, the last thing I need is someone hovering over me while I have fun.  This one, however, you're always greeted with a hello, asked if you need help, and make their presence available when you're ready for it.

Like others have said, parking is a+++!  This Sephora is easily accessible and not such a journey to get to like the Planet Hollywood or Venetian location (although I think it's awesome that the Venetian has a whole section dedicated to Make Up Forever, as its one of my favorite brands!!!).  This location has a good selection of products too.  That's a plus because it makes it a convenient one stop shop.  Don't like it?  Changed your mind?  No worries, just bring it back for a full refund with receipt or store credit w/o one.  I love this policy because when it comes to any beauty product it's all trial and error.  Having the option to bring it back really brings comfort when you end up dropping well over $200 for things you probably don't even need.  This brings me back to how much I love this store!!  I can never walk out without purchasing anything, even if its something I can do without. 

*Quick tip: Do take advantage of the beauty insider card.  There's no charge and its quick and easy to sign up for.  You get a ton of perks, especially once you become a V.I.B.  Every time you make a purchase you collect points that you can use to redeem featured products.  They have 100 and 500 pt. giveaways.  Anyway, happy shopping, and say hello if you happen to see me in there... because I'm always there. haha =P.Every time I come in here I feel all warm and joyful inside.  This is my favorite business established EVER!Great little coffee shop in downtown phoenix. Love the atmosphere and the people here. The coffee tastes great and it is much quieter and personal than lux coffee. I prefer this place a lot more. 
I love the decorations and the coffee is good on my tongue. ;)All I ordered was a small pepperoni pizza and a soda, but I can't wait to eat here again.  If you don't like greasy pizza, and you're a light weight, this place isn't for you.   But, if you know what good pizza is supposed to look and taste like, and you appreciate service that keeps your drink full the whole time, stop by and order a pie.  Totally unexpected, but like the name suggests, when I left here, I was very happy and quite mellow.I just returned from a fantastic massage at n8 touch! Yesterday I participated in a long-distance triathlon event. Last week, in anticipation, I decided to use a Groupon for a post-race massage. I had purchased a Groupon for another business and contacted them to schedule. They informed me that they had no openings for weeks, but "squeezed me in" in 2 weeks (the day before my Groupon expired) because I was nice. 

Today I woke up and could barely move. I purchased a Groupon for n8 and called them right away, praying they would get me in. The woman who scheduled my appointment could not have been more accommodating. I have read many reviews and have experienced myself, that often when you use a Groupon, you are almost treated like an annoyance. This was NOT the case at n8 touch. The receptionist was patient and pleasant and scheduled me happily for a 90-minute massage. 

My appointment was with Emily, and she was fabulous. I have had around 15 massages in my life, and never have I felt that someone was so in tune to my aches, pains and needs. I could not have asked for a better experience. Some might call me frugal, but I would be happy to pay full price for another massage (and will!).My husband and I have been using Eli The Handyman exclusively for over 5 years for services and upgrades on our properties. Based on our satisfaction and referrals, he has also serviced countless friends and family members....the feedback is always the same. "Eli and team are simply fantastic.... The last Handyman I will ever hire." TRUSTWORTHY, efficient, talented, friendly and affordable. 

For me, allowing contractors into my home was always uncomfortable. (Where do I hide the valuables, will they invade my privacy, etc.) With Eli, this thought never crossed my mind, after our first service appointment. He personally supervises all jobs and ONLY employes a hand-selected group of like-minded, talented professionals who share his same work ethic and integrity. No project is too big, or too small and his work stands on its own. I feel blessed to have found Eli The Handyman and know he'll do great work for you, too! (Lastly, it doesn't hurt, that he's one cool dude!) Thank for everything you've done for us, Eli! Above and Beyond is an understatement.Had a steak here and it was excellent. A full course meal is pricey for students - but its worthwhile if you get a chance.This place is a hidden Gem.  Everything is really fresh and has a good taste.  So many cafes are just blaze (pronounced blah-zay) not sure how to spell it, lol.  I always enjoy the food there and being greeted by Olivier.  Definitely worth the trip, if you can find it...I always pass this place while driving on the 215 and wondered if it was any good. I always assumed it would be some typical cafe with subpar food and generic coffee, considering it's location in a cluster of business buidlings. And boy, i was wrong! I was in the area today so i decided to try it out. When we got there, there was a line literally going out the door. We waited about 15 minutes so i would suggest avoiding going there during lunch hour. When we got to the register, we were helped by a guy who was really friendly and informative about their menu. He remembered our names and seemed to genuinely care for his customers. 

I got the turkey sandwich and an iced white mocha and my friend ordered the curry chicken sandwich and a funky monkey specialty drink. We were so hungry and being that they were so busy, we knew it would take some time to get to our order so we grabbed a goji bar to munch on. The bar was made from all naural products so i expected it to taste like cardboard but it ended up being SO GOOD! Our sandwiches were also delicious, especially the baguette that they were on. 

While waiting for our food, we kept eyeing the peach tart that was in the display case. We ended up giving in and buying a slice and im sooo glad we did! It was probably my favorite part of the meal. It wasnt too sweet and the crust was the best i've tasted in a while! 

This place is awesome and i would definitely recommend eating there!PRO: perfect sized portions, inexpensive but EXCELLENT value, super friendly service, nice café atmosphere, vegetarian options
CON: small, can get crowded and/or loud.This place is a 2-minute walk from my house. That could get dangerous. Everything I've had so far has been excellent. Good frozen yogurt. Fresh and tasty toppings. It seems decently priced too (I have yet to pay).Such a quick touristy thing to do for a ride out of the Strip, but why not? There is a tiny parking lot just for the sign. But you can only enter it heading south. 

When you take your pic, make sure to get the Mandalay Bay in the background. There's a guy that takes everyone's pics for a tip. 

It takes 5-10 min to wait for your turn, depending on the size of the line, 10 min to take your pics and go. And if you're like me, an extra 15 min to make 2 U-turns because you forget your camera case and hat. Geez. Lol.  

The day we went, there was a big group of about 25 or so military people posing with their flag in front of the sign. I have no idea what they were doing there. 

Don't forget to take a pic with the back of the sign, "Drive Carefully. Come Back Soon."One of the happiest days of my life yesterday: Dad's Grilled Cheese for lunch followed by going to Popcorn Girl. 

Popcorn Girl is one of those specialty places that really know what they're doing. After hearing so many great things about this place I had to check it out for myself, and I wasn't let down. 

I consider myself a popcorn snob and I am not afraid to admit it. I have send back under par popcorn to popcorn factory, which I usually love. Anyway I went in here with high hopes of trying some flavors and ended up trying a whole bunch and chatting it up with popcorn girl herself. She is awesome and take the time to chat with her if you can. 

I tired loaded bake potato before coming in the store and while I was there I had Dill Pickle, Lemon Meringue Pie, Chocolate Peanut Butter, and Southwest Hot Wing. AMAZING. Ended up getting mini bags of the Pickle, Jalapeno ranch, SW Hot Wing, Banana Cream, and some candy cigarettes. 

Later that night I had a taste test and let the boyfriend try some and now we are hooked. The Banana Cream, out of this world. 

I was most impressed by the free samples. They really want you to try them and they give you a nice portion to actually taste. I love how the seasoning isn't so strong that you can only eat a handful of this stuff. It's nicely coated and oh so good!Hands down best massage of my life.

Found John through Yelp and decided to schedule with him after reading all of his great reviews- and I'm so glad I did! John is professional yet very therapeutic.  He takes the time to listen to areas of concern prior to the massage. I quickly learned that John has the hands of an angel & I left my session feeling completely rejuvenated and refreshed.  I especially enjoyed the stretching during the massage.

Definitely plan to return on a monthly basis!Love their burgers & fries
Period ... !!!!!!Great place. Great salads and sandwiches. I recommend the baby bleu salad or the RBC sandwich. GREAT local and not local a beer on tap an in bottles. GREAT all day happy hour on sundays and mondays $2.50 drafts all day!Best jalapeño dip ever! Cash money sandwich is delish as well! Cool little spot to hang with friends.The BEST sandwich in Phoenix, hands down!  I  am extremely picky about my sandwiches.  I would argue that this place is NOT for kids...I have brought my kids here 4 times and they do just fine. This is a cute old house turned into a restaurant; very pacific northwest!  The sandwiches are AWESOME.  The first time I came here, I immediately found excuses to come back; it is like a sick addiction that you can't escape, no matter how hard you try.  I am trying to eat all their sandwiches by the end of the year!  The happy hour is great and they have beers from all over on tap.  Don't miss out on this place, it is EPIC!I've eat here a couple times and it was fantastic. The menu is nice and short, but you can't go wrong with the selections. Save your decision make for what to drink. 

Location: Great view of the Capitol right in the square. The restaurant itself is small but cozy. You be sharing stories with your neighbors. 

Food: I've only had lunch but the Poutine was yummy. I can't believe we didn't invent that before the neighbors to the North. Turkey sandwich Is fantastic and nothing beats homemade chips. 

Drinks: if you can't find something you like then there us something wrong with you. 28 beers on tap with over a hindered in the bottle. 40 different wines if that is your poison. I had the Hennipen from Coopers Town delicious.I have been to Mabels several times since the opening, and I have had nothing short of a stellar experience with this place. 

The Drinks: I am an avid champagne drinker, and it is SO refreshing to see something other than Moet Chandon served by the glass! Aside from a good champagne list, they serve specialty cocktails that are off the beaten path and artfully crafted by bartenders that know what they are doing. 

The Food: Aaron May. Need I say more? You must, I repeat must, have an order of the deviled eggs with caviar. The tuna carpaccio has become a dish that I regularly fantasize about, as well as the filet bites. The best part about the food, is that it's never too much. It's just the right amount, so you feel like you can enjoy your drink and not be too full. 

The Atmosphere: No lies, whenever I am at Mabels I feel glamourous. The mid-century decor, low lighting and music definately set a mood that is anything but Scottsdale Nightlife. The imprinted-tin ceiling, in combination with dark woods and plush seating is somehow inviting and upscale at the same time. Check out the ladies room for sure...the floor is all pennies. How cool is that?

Overall, if you couldn't tell by now, im smitten with this place. Once you go, you too will develop a crush.Super nice amazing place.. Unbeatable taste of Mediterranean food

I went to four different kabob resturants in Tempe and Mesa and i got an idea that kabob restaurants are all the same.. Same kind of food with slight differences in spices, quantity or may be the service
But when I went to the Flaming Kabob at Mesa location it was absolutly different.. the place is really awesome and the Combo plate was amazing specially the falafel and the rice. The lintel soup was really tastey..
Very good and quick service. I insist to meet the chef to tell my opinion and she was really nice and chearfull lady
Flamming Kabob will be my restaurant every time I have to come to PheonixHUGE portions! Spicy Chicken Wrap was twice the size of a Burrito from "that place" down the street!Terrific, terrific, and did I mention Terrific! Delicious food, great atmosphere, great prices, and super service!! We can't wait to go back!I hired  4 therapists to give the staff at my office chair massages. They were awesome. Prompt, courteous, and gave my staff an excellent experience. Would highly recommend.This is a locally owned establishment by a hard working family.  Kudos to them for "sticking it to the man" in the uber-competitive pizza market.  To do that you have to do a few things really well and they have.

Quality - the food tastes fresh!  This isn't some mass produced pizza or sandwich slung together by a parolee at one of the Sandwich-Mart's.  Their food tastes like your Italian Grandma made it special just for you!

Price - The economy is tight.  Everybody has an eye on their wampum and most won't part with it easily.  Rochelli's offers fair prices that are in line with (or maybe a little better than) the competition.  Quite a feat considering their quality!

Service - The owners are in the restaurant.  They are there putting their soul into that place and you can tell that they care.  I went in to pick up some pizza for take out the other day and all of the wait staff (owners included) made it a point to come by and talk to me like I was family.  THEY CARE!

Give them a shot!Best Horchata EVER!  The Tacos and salsa were also some of the best I have ever had.  Try the mole taco.We went to the Hash House a Go Go during our last trip to Vegas, so when we went this year, we had to revisit. We ended up revisiting 3 out of 4 days for breakfast during this trip!
For one, our service was excellent every time we were there. The wait staff moves like clockwork through the restaurant, they are fast, efficient, and energetic. They must have great management because everything was very organized. 
I thought it was a lot to pay for breakfast, but it was a heck of a lot better than a $20 buffet. The food was fresh and you got more than enough food for one person to eat. 
And the food... oh my. The french toast and apple cinnamon pancakes were more like dessert than breakfast. I had the ham, spinach, and bacon scramble with grilled mashed potatoes and an enormous biscuit that were all delicious, especially the peach preserves that came with the biscuit. 
I would recommend this restaurant to anyone for an excellent breakfast in a city that is more geared to the night life, rather than those of us who get up early and like a good breakfast. I didn't go there for lunch or dinner, but I think we went there enough in a 4 day stay!I currently work front desk at the Wilkins Learning Center. I have been here for over a year, and wake up excited to go into work. How many people can say that? Every morning I get a huge hug from the Wilkins and Barbara and am told what a great job I do, and how much I am appreciated. When I am sick, I get texts and phone calls asking how I am feeling and that the staff and kids miss me.  I have never had such an amazing, rewarding job. Working in such a positive and loving environment is so great! Everyone who steps foot in Wilkins falls in love with all the staff, and loves the way we treat their kids with love and respect!In and out in 5 mins.  Greeted immediately when I walked in the store.  Shipped a package and was on my way out when their book rack caught my eye.  Found a great book to read.  Yay!  I will definitely come back again.  They do copies and printing too.   Even have cards on a rack just in case you need to send a birthday card to someone.This is the best place in Phoenix to buy pre-fab slabs of granite/stone for countertops. They have a great selection and great prices. When you buy pre-fab granite it comes with a finished edge so it makes fabrication a lot less expensive. They have a good stock on hand so if you need something quick, there is a good chance that they've got it!

I've never used them for cabinets, but the quality definitely seems to be nice and their work speaks for itself. Check out their showroom - You'll be glad you did!Very clean and comfy too. Woke up refreshed and smiling. Would stay here again in a heart beat. The freebies are AWESOME. Great food and drinks.Was VERY impressed by the work done at this little shop. My car looked terrific; the seats and flooring returned to beautiful condition and they buffed out many of the imperfections in the body. Really great work from conscientious fellows who seem to take pride in a car that looks as good as it possibly can!We have been coming here for more than 10 years and the food is fantastic. Our favorite is the chorizo and eggs it doesn't get better than this! Homemade tortillas, chips and salsa start every meal. The carne asada and the whole fish dinner so good! 
Great food priced right!I moved to Arizona 2 years ago and finally I found Mijana best Lebanese food ever in Arizona I go over there 3 times a week,I love it.We had a great time at the Diamondbacks game! Not only are the tickets far more reasonably priced than other stadiums in have been to, the value continues on to the concessions. $1.50 for a hot dog? $4 for a beer? Not to mention great prices on t-shirts and hats ($9.99). We sat in the club terrace where we had an awesome view, comfy padded seats and in seat ordering. I can't wait for our next visit!This is a nifty new Hampton Inn.  It has the unique quality of being close to a lot (for the east valley Phoenix metro area) but feeling like it is in the middle of nowhere.

Friendly staff and very convenient to the southeast valley of the Phoenix metro area.

Hampton Inns are just more consistent than many other chains...and I like the @HHonors program.  They have some nifty vacation places when I'm not traveling for business.

Clean, comfy, modern, convenient...'nuf said.The next time you're craving for a unique way to have coffee, please come visit this place.I remember visiting this store at the old location off Cave Creek and hearing about the move. I always find awesome deals and the owner always makes you feel right at home which is super cool. She is very knowledgeable and always has a great  selection.Family is important at this gem of a resturant.  Authentic Italian dishes cooked by a chef by way of NYC.  Great atmosphere, and the braschole with sunday gravy, bellisima.  Okay that's all the Italian I know which as you can see is not that much.  This is a great place to come, dress casual, or wear a suit, what ever, and sit back and enjoy the food.  For me it's like eating at a resturant like Sinatra in vegas, without the $400 bill.  Granted the bill was about $175, but we had a lot to eat and drink. Next time your in the mood to take a trip down italy lane, this place won't steer you wrong.I had a traveling emergency this afternoon with a carsick kid. I don't live in the area and asked a guy in a parking lot if he knew where a car wash was. He sent me here. Though they had every reason to turn me away, they were 20 minutes to closing, they agreed to service my car. For a reasonable price, they took me in and agreed to customize a car detail to my needs. Everyone had a smile on their face, and though it's taking them past closing they were good enough to help a mama out. In the car service world where women are often taken advantage of, I feel like these guys cut me a break. This is better than my Lysol wipes and paper towel job could ever do in an emergency. It's now 20 minutes after closing and they're still working for me. THANK YOU SUPERSTAR CAR WASH! I will be able to finish out the last hour of my drive without gagging. Just inspected it...FANTASTIC work! No trace of the horrid smell. It's out of the cracks crevices and carpet. Bring them your business.Quick, easy and I love that they have a pharmacy in house.Great service, great prices, and Albert is an avid ASU alum.  And my kids love his dog.  Five stars!I highly recommend Harris Dental Group. I was recently considering leaving them after many years as I now live approximately 50 ...See More
I highly recommend Harris Dental Group. I was recently considering leaving them after many years as I now live approximately 50 miles from them. However, after going in for a standard cleaning I was reminded of how professional and likable they are and have decided to continue being their patient. Everyone there is very friendly and professional and they seem to always be using a new and improved procedure to improve your experience there.This is the real deal...authentic Mexican food!! If you've been craving real street tacos, this is the place! Exceptional food, great service and awesome prices! Everything was fresh, from the tortillas to the meat to the guacamole and salsa!Amazing! Nicest guy working when I went in- super helpful! Gave me honest advice about what to do with the car. I am super happy with the price and repair work on my exhaust system! If anyone I know or if ever I need more work done, I will not hesitate to give them more business!This place is a gem, instead of spending $2,000 on an Exhaust, i decided to do Muffler Delete on my M6 & a month later on my 650i, Russ handled both vehicles & i couldn't be happier. 

These guys are precise & on point with their work, excellent craftsmanship! thanks!Love this location, can't go 10 feet without an employee asking if I need help! They also know what they are talking about if you have a question.I drove out to Vegas with some friends and when we were about an hour away, the A/C went out. I had just taken my car in to my shop back home the weekend before in preparation for the trip, so I wasn't too happy about that. Found Max Auto Care through Yelp and decided to give it a try. I'm so glad I did. Ali was so nice and helpful through the whole process. He explained what happened and what different options I had to fix it. We ended up having to special order a part and had to stay an extra two days and Ali offered to help us find a good rate for the extra days, then drove us back to our hotel. When my car was finally fixed, the total cost was less than what my guys back home would've charged. It's a tough situation, having your car break down when you're on vacation. It'd be really easy to take advantage of someone in that situation and I'm pleased to say Ali didn't. He made me feel so much better about the whole ordeal and I would definitely recommend going to see him.Definitely the happening place to be in Vegas. Marquee their night club was rated number one in the country. It's worth the money.  My friend left $50 in the bed and the maid came back to our room to tell us where she had left the money b/c she found it in the bed.  Which was a super sweet thing to do. 

If you are fat don't sit in the big shoes they have strategically placed around the hotel and take pix in them. They do break and it's not a pretty sight.

Also, Vegas is not a place for kids at least not if you are staying at one of the larger hotels. There's debauchery everywhere so keep that in mind.My dream hotel in Vegas was always the Cosmopolitan. I vowed to stay there one day but my frugal side always got the best of me and I would book another (fabulous) hotel that was less pricey. However, when my job gave me an opportunity to be put up in the Cosmopolitan for a client summit, I was so excited to see if the accommodations would live up to my expectations. Needless to say, they exceeded everything and anything I could have hope for!! 

I stayed in a suite with every luxury you could imagine...a fully stocked bar, beautiful  living room, full Japanese soaking bath tub, luxurious bedding with flat screen TV, awesome toiletries (don't lie, you know you care about this!), a fabulous closet, and an amazing balcony overlooking parts of the strip. I almost wanted to ditch the conference and hibernate in my room for the entire trip! Unfortunately, I had to leave way too many times throughout my brief stay, BUT I made sure I used the tub and luxuriated in my suite enough to put a smile on my face every time I think of my experience. 

On a general note, this hotel has everything you could ever want. The decor is elegant and retro enough to make you feel truly glamorous. The staff is friendly and helpful. The casinos are wonderful, and the restaurants and shops will leave you with an array of options from casual to decadent. Btw none of their shops are the same cookie cutter ones you find in every other high end hotel in Vegas. They're actually more boutiques than large stores. There is even a new pop up wedding chapel for anyone who wants to make the most of their stay! I can't say enough about this hotel except that I will definitely be staying there again. Go! Enjoy!Cosmopolitan it's been a month since I was all up in that, and I still cannot stop thinking about you.  You are high maintenance and a total scene, you are young and trendy and therefore super immature, but you're the prettiest girl on the block (the strip) and you're worth it.

I've done Vegas a LOT.  I've done Vegas cheap, borderline-homeless cheap, and expensive because someone else is paying.  I've gotten frustrated by staying in the wrong hotel and wasting money on cab fare just to stand in line at Drais, or chase the crowd over to Tao from Haze because we heard Leo was there, or simply get wasted and then lost, and then cry in the bathroom of the Bellagio.  I've also known what it is to be in a 30s/40s crowd as a 24 year old young woman and wonder what in the hell I'm doing at ANY lounge in the Wynn.  Who the F stays at the Wynn? 

So when I planned a Dirty 30 Celebration for my wonderful, sweet, demure blonde friend (basically she had VEGAS VIRGIN tattooed on her forehead the whole time) I knew we were staying at the Cosmo.  We weren't struggling with cabs and doing the whole barefoot scene down the strip with achy feet at 3 am.  We are settling down in the nicest hotel on the strip and letting the party come to us.  And by party I mean Rose Rabbit Lie and Marquee.  We'll have breakfast at The Henry, we'll wind down at Chandelier, and we'll always be coiffed and put together because we NEVER HAD TO LEAVE THE HOTEL.  

I'll write a separate review for Rose Rabbit Lie because it was incredible and deserves a separate nod.  Best parts of Cosmo that I took full advantage of: 
1) free valet parking - if you are renting a car you want to stay in a hotel that isn't going to charge you an arm and a leg,  the Cosmo's free parking has got to be a glitch in the system, I felt like I was getting away with something.  
2) concierge - concierge will not exactly discount you (especially if you are rude, I watched that happen, and honestly the price is the price people), but if you are friendly and simply want their help they will tell you insider-Vegas stuff about where to go, at what time, and where to avoid, they're also superb at getting show tickets and reservations.  We had our daily "resort fee" waived.
3) the spa - Sahra spa offers $25 day passes which we basically owned for the 3 hours we were there.  I even sung in one of the steam rooms.  There are snacks in the room where you wait for your treatment, theres a cold mist room, a dry and a wet sauna, a gorgeous hot tub with a fountain, bathrooms have all the amenities, a gym and a gift shop.

ROOM: The rooms are trendy and hip and vibey and teched out.  Our shower had a glass wall that made the view from the beds a LIVE SHOWER SCENE.  (We abided by the Honor System and kept the blinds down while each girl showered.)  (Or so this reviewer wants you to believe.)  (Just kidding.)  (Or am I?)

POOL: My only complaint is the Marquee pool (shitshow) and the Bamboo pool (the more private one) were both closed.  We had the Boulevard pool which looks out on the strip and was still a good time.  We just didn't have options and a girl likes her options.  

MARQUEE: Was awesome.  Monday night is industry night!  It's a must!  We skipped breezily to the front of the line because we were key holders (guests of the hotel) and also didn't pay cover (there's a cover charge for girls? what is this miami? rude.)

OTHER BARS (Chandelier, Bond): Bond offers a free show constantly, whether its boys in suspenders on swings or girls with feather peacock tails standing on the bar, I even saw a guy on stilts once.  Chandelier is a gorgeous bougie lounge where I've never been known to wear anything other than a tiny dress and I've also never been known to receive a bill for any of the drinks I've imbibed.  High rollers welcome.  Spacious, trendy, relaxing, ornate, glamorous, it's adult disneyland.I tried this place for the lunch buffet since I was on this side of town. Yes, these are culinary students, and yes they do have an instructor supervising them. The buffet options are limited, but everything is done in small batches so it is fresh and hot. Since there are quite a few students in the kitchen and the dining area, service is very quick and drinks are refilled fast. Even though it is a buffet, the introductory appetizer for each table are some very well done thinly sliced potato chips that are not greasy, but super crispy served with a dipping sauce. At the buffet, you are also served by students.Love this place!  :)I use this CVS for all my prescriptions. They are always courteous and polite, and usually don't take long to fill scrips while you wait. They have also been good about doing the legwork when there are issues with my insurance. 5 stars for customer service.Came here looking for specific tires for a NSX, and they got them quick for me. I had them install it, and when I drove the car with the new tires it drove like a exotic car. They were probably the only company that could get me the tires as quick as they did. Thanks again tire works.I think one of the best grooming place I've been too. They have the best hospitality a place can have. Johnny is the guy to go to if you are looking for that old school clean look pompadour or combover style. My $30 was well worth it here.We called Focus Plumbing, a company we had done business with in the past,  three times, and since they never returned our call, we called Precision.  A real person answered the phone and sent a technician the same day.  Paul Messingschlager arrived on time, unclogged our drain using a vacuuming machine, (and showed me how to do it myself if it ever happened again).  He actually left our kitchen cleaner than when he started, carefully mopping the floor where some water had leaked during the process.   He looked at our water softener, giving expert diagnosis and advising we contact the retailer who sold it to us.  The plumber who previously looked at our water softener told us it was just fine...  Paul took it apart and showed me where and why it was malfunctioning.  It took more effort to do so, but it confirmed the fact that Precision Plumbing trains its technicians to do a thorough job.  Paul was very professional, competent and has earned not only any future business when we are in need of a plumber, but also our confidence in recommending them to our friends and family.
So the moral to this story is that it pays to answer the phone, if you run a business.  By not doing so, Focus lost us to a company that communicates exceptionally well with its customers, trains its technicians to be competent professionals, and values its customers.  We will be loyal customers of Precision Plumbing in the future.Clean office with a friendly an inviting environment. The staff is very sweet and organized. Dr. Luis J Lopez was very patient and knowledgeable about all my concerns and questions. This was my first appointment with them and the in-processing paperwork took only a few minutes. I would recommend him to everyone.This is a GREAT place for gyros! They look and taste better than any advertisement you've ever seen. They also have awesome sides, the hummus is to die for served with warm, fresh pita bread. You can tell everything is home made here and made to order.Cardenas Market is very clean, very good prices. The staff unlike any other super-friendly, you can ask anyone for a sample of anything and they will immediately give it to you.  While standing for over 1 minute at the meat counter a lady with a microphone came by and called the butcher, whom came running to serve us. 
Cheeses galore (yum!). We have so far only had their chicken, which is delicious, the tortillas are great and do not get hard the next day like Marianna's. I could write more, but you get the point. Definitely worth the 20min drive.Wanted to try this place out since it was on the way home and I was quite pleased. Malica was the one who did my eyebrows and she did amazing! She is a very sweet worker! She did it pretty fast and it didn't turn out bad at all. Definitely going back!Truly a rare find in the southern Nevada area....in terms of orthodontists or even in general terms for doctors in the healthcare profession. Dr. Gibson and his staff are genuinely caring people and he takes time to not only take care of your teeth but make you feel like a human and not just another number.  Great chair side manner and always takes time to ask how your day has been.  I'm an adult and he treats me as an adult patient, but I have observed him working with younger children and teenagers and he has the type of personality that makes people of all ages feel comfortable.  He is good at explaining the process and progress of the orthodontia work, and also makes sure you are satisfied with the outcome.  He never seems like he is trying to rush things to get you out the door, and he also has extended hours during the school year, which makes it convenient for any adults considering orthodontia.  If you don't mind driving....or even if you do mind driving....I would still recommend Dr. Gibson.  I went to several orthodontists for consultations before choosing to go with his clinic and hands down he was the right choice.There will be more reviews to come, but I have only had the shredded beef burrito and it was amazing!  I was a little disappointed it didn't come with cheese, but dealt with it because the taste was so great.  Just ordered my second shredded beef burrito and added all the fixings.  We've been looking for great Mexican place in town and have only found one other place,(Lindo Michoacan) where we spend a massive amount.  This is great Mexican food, made by very nice people and hard to find here in Vegas for their great prices.Thank you fellow Yelpers for the GREAT recommendation!! My eleven year old daughter and I went in for a treat today, and a treat is exactly what we got!! Yes, we had to wait about 15 minutes because we didn't have an appointment, but it was WELL worth the wait!  We both had the deluxe pedicure and it was probably the best pedicure I have ever had!  Mai was so meticulous and did a wonderful job of pampering my tired feet and helping me relax!  Even the woman who did my daughters pedi was super sweet and treated her as if she was a regular customer, not a child.  We felt so pampered and loved that our feet tingled for the next few hours after our pedis!  Next time we will definitely make an appointment, and we will absolutely be back!!Shannon Smith is the bomb.com! She is REALLY good at doing colors such as red, pink, purple, etc. I love getting my hair done because I know she will do exactly what I want. I highly recommend her if youre looking for hair that stands out in the best way!Our dogs love it here!  They always have them groomed within a couple of hours and call right away.  Prices are reasonable and service is excellent!They are always nice and friendly and remember me...sometimes the Starbucks in my mall the I visit all of the time doesn't remember me, that says a lot. My order is always right and I do t always feel tht way at every Coffee Bean, this one I will go out of my way for. Keep up the good work!My boyfriend and I love this place and have been several times! Everything comes out quick weather it is to go or dine in. The same woman is always waiting tables and seems to usually be the only one doing so, still she is prompt and polite! The menu is rather large and includes combination dinners that come with soup, an entree, an egg roll, and a crab Rangoon for 8.95 or 9.95! The food is what you would expect from an Americanized Chinese restaurant but everything is always tasty and hot. I am sure we will be back again soon!Honest, helpful, and wonderfully friendly. I am EXTREMELY picky when it comes to my pet's health care; these guys fit the demands perfectly. With a healthy range of practical experience and the new guys who are smart on the latest technology, Grand Montecito Animal Hospital is the place to go! My pup, Kirin, sees Dr Bivens and Dr Blue. Both are incredibly knowledgeable and approachable. I never feel intimidated or 'talked down to" here as I have felt at other Hospitals. They take great pride and care in giving your pet the BEST treatment possible. Dr. Lewis' knowledge base is invaluable! 
Dr. Blue and Bivens worked together to give Kirin the best options for her needs and did a wonderful job at fixing her entropion. I am so pleased with their skill and care.
The office is always friendly and accommodating. Minette, Katie, and Gaby  are always there with a great smile and kind words.
Kirin loves them all just as much as I do; her tail starts wagging like crazy as soon as we pull into the parking lot. That alone is probably the best indication of just how amazing they really are.I have been coming here for my wheel and tire needs for 2 years and Janet makes it so easy to keep coming back all of her help and recommondations have been perfect I have purchased wheels and tires for 4 different vehicles and she always makes sure everything is great. If you want great customer service with a SMILE come see these guys !!I love this place!!!! It was a little harder to find and on the expensive side but it is worth every penny. GREAT steak and seafood too, you know it's good when everyone at the table loves their food and you can't pick out a favorite.We recently bought a $250 gift certificate from Star Nursery, so we could get a free landscaping plan.  Heather designed such a wonderful plan for our "pool" yard.  She obviously spent hours on this project.  Her enthusiasm for the plants she choose was definitely transferred to us.  She gave us so much information and spent 1.5 hours with us describing each plant, and why she choose it. We can't wait to get started planting!!!  Along with the plan, we received an estimation of the cost of the plants.  We spent thousands of dollars with previous landscapers, and the plans were so traditional LV. Awesome experience!great food! love the nachosGreat place to hangout and smoke cigars without having to be in the busy hussle & bussle of of other casinos. I was here for Big Smoke and had the pleasure of smoking cigars and spending some time with Paul  and Sarah Vato of Vato cigars, they were very hospitable host! I like the set up, location and the atmosphere of Benny's! Plus having cigars so close is a nice plus and I would come back because we enjoyed the service, staff, great prices on drinks and food.

Thanks again to the Benny's Bullpen staff for making things so enjoyable!I'm still dreaming about this place.

The dirty chips, pretzel bites and french fries were ALL delicious... the best I'v had in my life-- the lobster roll.  Amazingly devinely dream-worthy.

Service was ++, a tad bit pricey, but expected on the strip, esp in Aria.I have visited Shauna a few times now and she never disappoints. She is skilled in several modalities and knows how to bring the pressure for all my knots. 
I have been to massage therapists around the world and I am glad to have found Shauna right here in my backyard.Love this place! It's close to my work, every time I walk in the bartender has a beer ready for me.  The food is amazing, I have tried almost all of their burgers and the wings are some of the BEST in phxVery tasty food, good prices, very nice staff, and nicely decorated inside.  Our business is just across the street and they have great lunch special and quick service if you want take out.I became a fan of Total Wine last year when I was visiting my family in Arizona... my girlfriend and sister were at a movie (Twilight or something, so of course I opted out) and I had 2 hours to kill.  Spent half of it at Total Wine being wowed by the selection and prices.  That day I left with a 6-pack of microbrew raspberry beer and a bottle of absinthe.

I was also absolutely stoked that my favorite wine, Tobin James Notorious, was in stock and for sale for like $16.  The only place I could find it before was at Marche Bacchus, and it was $21 there.  I had been planning to make trips to AZ just to pick up a couple bottles, but now there's a Total Wine in my backyard so I don't have to.

The staff at the Summerlin location are just as helpful and friendly as the ones in Arizona.  An employee stopped us and asked us if there was anything we needed help with.  We were there to replace a bottle of tequila, and he recommended a cheaper brand that apparently got rave reviews.  We stuck with the brand we were replacing (for a friend), but his knowledge and helpfulness show you what kind of a place you're dealing with.

He also told us to sign up on their mailing list to get info on their weekly wine tastings, but I haven't gotten emailed just yet.  Guess I'll have to stop by tomorrow and see if they're running them.Good selection, great pricing.   Not a bad place to get a good variety of wines.I can not say enough good things about Marie. She is very friendly and makes you feel at ease while she's giving you a brazilian wax. The last thing I want to have to worry about while getting one, is feeling uncomfortable with the person doing it. She talks to you the whole time to try to get your mind off of what's going on. She also remembers her repeat customers. If you are looking to get a brazilian wax, or any wax for that matter, I strongly suggest you try Le Spa..I met Melinda two years ago when she was working with other trainers in the South Bay. She accepted my 65 lb. pit with an open heart and open arms and had no hesitation walking him or helping to train him with her positive methods. My previously excitable and reactive big guy has had Melinda's help in her classes - graduating from Canine Good Citizen and passing the Therapy Dog class. He went on the be positively evaluated by Therapy Dog Internationals trainer, too. My dog would not be the same without Melinda's positive, calm and progressive training methods and we are thankful for her good cheer and professionalism. As an aside - she also taught him how to shake hands in about 5 minutes and he now uses this skill to break the ice with new people! Thanks to Melinda and Pawsitive Partners for helping me cement my positive relationship with my dog!Amazing little place where you're surrounded by wine. You can try out cheeses, and wines, and all kinds of stuff!

Food details:
Seared scallop salad, avocado, cherry tomato, vinegrette

Cheese plate and have gluten free crackers!

Amazing wines

Very cute place for a date.I have been to RnR a few times since it has opened.  I have read people have had slow service.  I feel that it has improved 110%.  We had an awesome server the last time I was in on Friday night.  The chicken lollipops are to die for!  The Stigmata (sp?) Vodka drink with berries is also fantastic.  
They brought in a DJ that night after happy hour.  My friends and I sang and danced in our seats all night.  Great place!!We attended a private event here on the upstairs patio, which they had rented out. My review pertains to this experience, which included drinks and appetizers. I can not comment on actual meals, or wait service. 

The patio itself was cute ,with its own bar upstairs, and the ambiance was lovely at the sunset hour. Everything here is TRENDY and we liked the lollipop chicken, bacon/Ruben melts, and artichoke dip. 

The drinks were great and I liked my margaritas a lot. The bartender was friendly and made drinks quickly. I think this woukld be a great area t consider renting out for a rehearsal dinner or work event.We dine at this restaurant every Monday. We like food that much. Great Cheese Fondue and amazing Crepes. They have a great variety of dishes on the menu to fit anyone's taste. You have to try their desert Crepes...very delicious never disappointing. We have also joined them for many of their musician shows and always enjoy. The owner is there most of the time and very interactive with the customers. Tim the bartender is very entertaining if you want to eat at the bar. Scotty and the rest of the crew are friendly and always make us feel at home.This was my first time attending Devoured, and I needed it to be good.  Since CRAVE was postponed, then canceled, then a hassel to get our refund, I was looking for a great new tasting event to sink my teeth into. 

Devoured was fantastic. What an amazing location to be held in the sculptural garden at the Phoenix Art Museum. The restaurants and wineries represented did a great job at keeping the food and drinks flowing. I think everyone there also appreciated the bottled fuji water coolers around the event as the sun got a little warm. 

Some of my favorites included the chocolate-peanut butter mouse dessert from Arogant Butcher, the goatsmilk cheese and tomato jam bruschetta at Postinos, and the vegan buffalo wing from Green Restaurant.  

I will definitely be back next year!Oatmeal Cookie Yogurt????  It is the best I have ever had.   I have been at least 3 times a week for the past month!  I hope its low fat, but really I don't care, its worth it.  I love this place, the people are friendly and very helpful!  I will be visiting again tomorrow!!This is our favorite date night place. The food and the staff have always been awesome.I tried this place with a Groupon and loved it! The theme is 60's which you probably have read. Every inch of this small diner is covered in decor. The service was excellent. Very attentive. I had basic scrambled eggs, crispy bacon, crispy hash browns & sourdough toast. It was perfect. My friend had the egg salad sandwich with homemade potato chips & pasta salad. She liked it. I tried the chips, delicious, especially dipped in ranch. The pasta salad tasted like strong italian dressing, we didn't care for it. Then we had the mini homemade donuts! They were awesome little fried donuts rolled in cinnamon & sugar! Mmm! Loved them! 
I will definitely be back!This place served me comfortably the best Sunday roast I've sampled in Edinburgh, so far. A quirky little spot, which I imagine suffers slightly from being a little betwixt and between places, it really is worth seeking out, as the kitchen is serving up some really top quality fare.

Overall, we said: "I was delighted with Elbow. I'm sorry not to have discovered it before now, as I'm often asked for Sunday brunch/lunch recommendations, and I know many people who would be as highly delighted with this place as I was, today. For sure, it goes right to the top of my list of recommendations as a great place to spend a Sunday, particularly when you're feeling the need for a hearty roast."I've been a member of the Village for quite awhile and loved the place for all it's ammenities but for some reason I would dread going there. In retrospect, the drive was just a hassle, the distance, the traffic. For the gym itself the hoards of kids screaming jumping around was a lil tough . So when I saw the reviews of Gold's elite that is only 1/2 a  mile  from my house I knew I had to check it out!
First, it was a little tricky for me to find but if you come down 1st st and turn right onto Washington, the oneway stay in left lane the parking garage is there on your left. Be careful pulling in!! Watch the signs! 

The gym is on the second floor and let me tell you!! Gorgeous view, wide open climate controlled gym to a cool temp. My salesperson Jessica is amazing she was fun, open and not a hard sell. The gym sells itself really! I got the full tour, signed up, made my first training appt, got my free travel passes for next week then I was out the door in 30 min! That was awesome I was on a schedule! another perk, the restaurant "First Watch" is on the corner and starbucks on the other !! I be ready for an egg-white omelet after a good workout !
I'll be riding my bike since it's so close. They don't have bike racks yet but no problem, they  will accomodate my wheels! The price is reasonable !!!
So bye bye Village you were good to me but hands down Golds Elite has what works for me !!Just got take out.  It was great.  Ordered the Thelma's Special and Chicken Tocino.  I look forward to more trips here!Love this gym! Big, clean and the staff if very nice.I've lived in Vegas for many years & I can't believe I didn't come to this place sooner! The food here is truly amazing as well as the service/atmosphere.. I highly recommend this local spot and I will definitely become a regular!Personable staff, great musical selections between 7am-12pm and 7pm-10pm, free wi-fi, and damn good drip. This place is sure to become a staple in anyone's weekly routine.Great Starbucks!  This Starbucks was across the street from the hotel I was staying in.  Staff was quick and friendly.  The seating area was large and clean.Love this place. Fast, delicious, cheap food. What is there to criticise?

You can really customise your burger the way you want it, and there's a large array of extra toppings to choose from. They offer a decent selection of vegetarian options, though I don't know if there are many vegan-friendly ones. I've never had a problem with the service there - it's fast, amenable, and they've never screwed up my order. The interior is bright and cheerful, with TVs playing sports. I find that it's not too loud, but others might disagree. The toilets are a trek, but they're perfectly clean (unusual in fast food places? I don't know). There's also a disabled toilet and I'm pretty sure a wheelchair-user would have little problems getting in. One of the great things about this place is you aren't crippled by indecision at the counter - there's a massive menu on the wall off to the side, so you can peruse to your heart's content before even approaching.

It's a bit out of the way considering the areas I normally frequent in Edinburgh, but it's worth the walk. It makes a good, filling lunch or dinner, and if you have a student card you won't spend more than £10 for two people! 

I've tried quite a few of their dishes now, and I can say with confidence: get the burgers (incl. Portabella mushroom), the fries, the milkshakes and the iced tea. Don't bother with the pancakes.What a great hotel restaurant just east of the strip on Flamingo Road.  An incredibly robust Italian Menu - all what you'd expect from a five star Italian restaurant in Vegas - without the high prices!  Stay here - and you get a $20.00 food credit making it that much more affordable.  The lobster and cheese ravioli dishes to die for!  The sauces were great!  Chocolate mousse cake for dessert?  None better.  Service by the hostess and wait staff was incredibly personable.  They were right there when needed without hovering.  We were seated immediately and received our order in no time flat.  Why pay more on the strip when you can enjoy a great meal at a great price right here at the Tuscany?  I've stayed at the Inn before and I came back because the rooms are HUGE and comfortable.This is now one of my absolute favourite shops. I fell head over heels in love with it when I popped in with a friend in December and saw their amazing array of beautiful Christmas decorations. All beautifully made and very reasonably priced.

I have visited a couple of times since, recently for a gift for my sister's birthday. She is notoriously difficult to buy for but I still managed to find something thoughtful here. 

The staff are lovely and friendly and they wrap whatever you buy in pretty tissue paper. If you need a gift for someone I would definitely recommend trying here, Halibut & Herring which is over the road in Bruntsfield, Eden on Cockburn Street or JOE on George IV Bridge.I have been writing reviews for Yelp for some time now, and I cant believe that I have only just decided to review Peckhams!!

This place, since I moved to Edinburgh some 3 years ago, has always held a special place in my heart.

The most amazing of all shops on South Clerk Street - this branch of Peckhams houses a vast selection of alcohol - everything from exclusive spirits and liquers, to real ales and odd beers as well as local ciders etc and posh wines, this place has it all. Thje deli counter which dominates the centre of the shop holds so many different meats, cheeses, odd edibles and cakes you could easily spend a months wages trying them all, while the rest of the shop houses foods which are mainly organic, local or just plain tasty.

A great place to come for something special.I really enjoy this place. The place is clean and service is great. Hot dogs are large and fries portions are huge. My wife and I share a small order most of the time.I'm not going to lie. I am a HUGE fan of Waitrose. I appreciate organic, good qualtiy fruits and vegetables. I know its more expensive but to me its an investment in my health which in the long run comes out cheaper. 

I love the selection of breads, cheeses and meats. Sometimes there are really good deals! Sometimes if you buy the meat from the butcher it can be really cheap, cheaper than conventional stores even!  

Great store. Just wish they had them all over the place, replacing Tescos and the like!!Wow....I can't belive it took me this long to go and check this place out.  It was off the chain.  The first time we just went to check it out.  You take your own chairs/blanket/Pillows/ Drinks....yesssssssssss  Drinks, food and relax it's awsome...But it's over ; v (  so next yr I will be there every Saturday.  They have vendors.  Food drins, clothing, and some other things as well.  But it's amazing.  The warm up bands are high school students so just....ummm yea wait for the real thing to hit the stage, it's well worth it.Inexpensive and delicious!!  Enough said.

If you don't go here, you will be missing out on a hidden gem.

https://www.facebook.com/noodleandriceazSo we double dated at Bachi Burger and the first thing we notice is that smell! It smelled so good!

Like my intro?  The 4 of us were all Bachi virgins and our cherries were about to get popped like goes the weasel!  All of us agreed to get a different burger each and a different specialty drink.  I ordered the Kalbi Burger which I thought was the biggity bomb!  It had kim-chee inside! It came with a side of Kim-chee style mini zucchini/cucumber, wasn't too sure what it was but it was tasty, and went well with my burger.  The drink i had was the strawberry lemonade jasmine tea (no free refills). It was really pulpy so if you order it, make sure you get a glass of water too to wash it all down.  And I can't forget the ox-tail chili cheese fries... Mmm! I just wish they put more ox-tail.

The overall experience at Bachi was a memorable one.  Service was fast, music was good, environment was comfortable, and the food was Uh-maze-zing!  I will definitely be back!My wife and I saw this place on Diners, drive ins and dives and so on our trip to Vegas we stopped by and tried their burger.  We tried two different ones and they were both great.  Very different as they claim it to have an Asian fusion.  We also tried the Oxtail chili cheese fries and it was awsome.  We were there on a sunday and we had to wait about 45 minutes to be seated.Took my 4 year old here when I visited my mom in Vegas this past summer and we loved it! All that bouncing tired me out pretty quickly but my husband and son jumped away to their hearts content.

There's plenty of space for you to jump, flip and basically ensure your legs have a crazy work-out. The employees make sure everyone's following the safety guidelines which is appreciated. There's also these jumpers on the side for the smaller kids which was perfect for my little one. We couldn't get in there with him but we were able to keep an eye on him the whole time as there's nothing to obstruct your view.

In the middle of the large warehouse is a snack shop and some arcade games, though we didn't try either of these. 

I'd definitely recommend this place for children's parties as well as just a spot to go to get out of the heat for an afternoon of good clean family fun. 

Will be back when we're back in town!there's little places in las vegas that have such great local hawaiian food and this is one of them. by far one of a handful of local places to go and get some real ono food. from da loco moco to the garlic chicken, there's nothing you can go wrong with on the menu. if you're lucky you can catch one of their specials and have a dinner that would make gordan ramsey customers jealous. top notch stuff, def a place I recommend!I must say that I am super stoked that this place finally pulled down the boards covering up the windows and unleashed their tortilla-awesomeness upon us all. 

I ate here for dinner the other night and was very impressed. I had the Green Chile Pork, which was soft, tender and spicy - all the things I look for in my Mexican dining experience. The real temptation that lies within this place is it's amazing, homemade tortillas. Right now, they primarily make flour, but don't fret, I have it on good authority that they are expanding to make corn tortillas as well. Literally, and I will try to be as unoffensive as possible, but you could fill that tortilla with solid waste and I would still eat it. Those tortillas are that good. If they were able to made into a blanket, I would consider buying sheets of them to adorn my house and then, obviously, my stomach.

If you go here, make sure you take the time to watch them make a few fresh tortillas. And a little bird told me that the most amazing thing on the menu thus far is the Oregano Lime Chicken. Beware - it is apt to induce restlessness because it is so good you will crave it fortnightly. 

Consider yourself warned.Ok. Queue my dilemma and frustration..... I have returned here manys a time now, I mean the beer selection is the best I have found yet, and the burgers, good god they are delicious!! 

BUT....... ugh, service has gone down a little I think. Not enough to take the Holyrood 9a down a star, I still wax lyrical about it so that would be a little hypocritical. I mean, the service is in no means awful, cold, rude, or anything that would warrant me getting up out my seat and leaving....... it just ain't as good as it was the first few times I went. This saddens me a little..... seriously, like employ me!!! This is the kind of place where I want someone upbeat, chatty, and overall really enthusiastic about the beer/burgers because to me that is what Holyrood 9a is all about. 

I am still totally digging those burgers though. And the strawberry milkshake........ it is criminally tasty!!Their chicken chow Mein is delicious!! You can customize with different noodle types. The service is fantastic and very quick! I love their smoothies as well with boba! I definitely will come here on a regular basis. It's a bit hidden but on the northeast corner of Dobson and Warner!Well worth the money!  Service is great food is outstanding and the overall energy in the restaurant is great!  get the mushroom pie!Kimberly was great!!!! She did the best acrylic fill in I've ever had-- fast, and my nails look oh so natural!!! I am so pleased. Then she topped them off with gel polish that looks to die for. My nails are so thin and look like real nails not fakes-- all for $38! She didn't charge me for my 2 repairs either. Can't wait to come back!I just moved to the area and was looking for a new place to get some mani/pedi tlc. I chose this place based on reviews and gave them a call. They said to come right in. I showed up, signed in and was taken back to the spa. Everything was nice and clean, cute layout, tv to stare at. My nails and feets were done by Mimi. I asked for a kind of a custom nail design (see Miami Vice photo) and even though the polish I chose was really runny, she took her time and made it work. Everything was great and I would definitely recommend this place! Mimi you were great! Love my nails!1st time there the other day and it was great! Loved the baby back ribs and the baked apples and the beans were deliciousGood Mexican food. The coctel de camaron is a good choice. Been coming here for two years.Love this place! It always has any kind of candy you could ever want! It has nerd ropes, candies from the 50's ect. This store is the type of place that is made out of dentists nightmares.I have loved practicing yoga here. The teachers are so friendly and do a great job describing the poses so no matter what level you are at you feel challenged.My husband and I came here for our 3 year anniversary after eating dinner at Okada. We had a friend who told us to talk to Justin at the door who could not have been nicer. And we also spent time talking to Drew one of the door guys who was the nicest door person we had ever met. 

Once inside this awesome club we sat at the tables with Sylvester as our dealer. And once again blown away by how friendly everyone was!

I literally wrote everyone's names down in my phone because I wanted to be sure to write a yelp review for them.

My husband is in the hospitality industry so we really notice and appreciate great service. And it was exceptional here.

Oh and the people, music and spot were also awesome. We went on a Wednesday night.Had lunch here with Rand H. and I found this place to be well decorated great service and the food was, well I said to Rand this place is my new favorite Indian buffet after my first plate (YUMMM). Everything I tried was very good from the tandoori chicken to the many veggy dishes. They even had that mango pudding with fruit cocktail in it that is so good. Another great treat offered is the mango juice that is part of the buffet as well. So if you like good Indian buffets do not miss this one.On the bigger weekends, this is the best party in America. Beautiful people that are easy to talk to, great DJ's, and an energy found nowhere else.

Tip: If you like to party really hard, get a lilypad close to the stage instead of a cabana. The cabanas are too far removed from the action. The lilypads put you right in the middle of it.Awesome!!!   The reviews seem to be all over the place but we were all very relieved, and impressed.  So glad we were so starving we decided to ignore the usual Buffet warning.   Food was great and freshly cooked (she cooked !  Owner/cook Joann is lovely and amazing!  The building does look somewhat tacky, but inside is nice and food great and great value.Was definitely pleased with the overall experience. The word buffet is a bit of a misnomer, as you don't go up to a bunch of trays scooping mediocre food onto a plate. The food was all freshly prepared as we were there, with a variety coming out ever since we had sat down. All of the foods had an excellent flavor, and you could tell the lady cooking it did this out of a love for cooking. 

I just told her we weren't that picky when she asked what we'd like to try, so she went back and started a few dishes...a nice variety, really. Then made sure we were all set, and attended to us rather wonderfully. The food itself was definitely good, but the service is what put this place over the top. It felt more like I was visiting somebody's home, with the warmth and personality I received. 

As for the posters mentioning the cleanliness, I didn't see any issue at all. I mean, its an older strip-mall suite so it doesn't look as immaculate as some brand-new standalone building, but everything in the restaurant was cleaner than most places I've been to.

I'll definitely put this place on my list of places to frequent, especially since it seems their capabilities for cooking, at least thai food, are rather varied, and I could see coming here multiple times and never having the same meal twice (a definitely love of mine in a restaurant)Very entertaining. These guys can dance their asses off! The theatrics, lighting and music were amazing as well. I do suggest that you sit either in the middle or further back. This is a show that you will enjoy more, FURTHER from the stage.This place is amazing! Don't let this rough looking little shopping plaza scare you off because inside the shop is some of the tastiest food in this part of town.  The Chili Cheese Fries are a must!  The "Rocket Burger" is a steal, imagine 3 burger patties with cheese and all the fixin's on a sub roll for 6 bucks (makes the $6 burger at Carl's Jr. look like child's play).  If you want something spicy ask for the "Thunder Bird", a buffalo chicken sub with bacon, ranch or blue cheese, and the optional fresh jalapeños. And if all of that is not enough to make you want to go these guys stock an insane amount of rare sodas that you will not find just any where. I think they had about 12 kinds of root beer! This is defiantly not fine dining so please excuse the rough decor, this is straight up man fuel.Awesome tasting burgers and sandwiches, a huge selection of boutique sodas and great service every time.

4-27-11 I have had their Rocket-Burger, California Club (as a sandwich and the large sub) and the New Yorker too. The burger was taller than my mouth! I love the fries because they are always hot and not underdone. Both the subs I tried were huge, chock full of good stuff. For like $7-$8 and some change in the tip jar you can get a big sub, fries and a drink either regular fountain or pick from 100+ different flavored sodas from out of the 6 coolers they have. I've been out of town..I need my Rocket Sub Fix. ;-)Took my second vehicle in for a windshield tint only as the rest of the car was already tinted. What a difference that made! I was concerned about visibility but with the 80% film it's almost translucent and actually cuts the glare during the day quote nicely. The owner Mike was a pleasure to deal with and is a class act across the board. They've earned a customer for life and if I purchase a different home in the future I will certainly be calling Mike to tint out the house which makes such a difference out here in the desert! Thx again Mike!!!! You the manWell I was searching for a good coffee shop since Starbucks now resembles a bus station and never has a coffee smell anymore.  Great coffee, french press offered, real cups, teas, french pastries, sandwiches and great soups.  Two stories and smells like coffee.  A bit "trendy" for me but worth the trade to have such good snacks and great coffee.  Espresso curled my hair - great!I love this place. It's great to go for dinner and a movie. The food is upper scale bar food. And I hesitate to make reference as "bar" food because it really is better than that. The outdoor patio is lovely, even in the winter as they have heat lamps all over. When I go there, my friends and I usually order several different items off the appetizer menu, as they are large portions and it's great to share. I love the atmosphere and I definitely recommend this place.I been reading the reviews about this place. My close friends recently ate there and raved about how good it was. So we decided to actually try it. We were on the way to Meadows and thinking about lunch. I grabbed my phone and clicked on the yelp app. I clicked bookmarks and Komex was the first one and right down the street.

We started with chips, guac and salsa. I ordered a bulgogi taco and burrito, the wife ordered 1 taco, won ton soup, the brother ordered 2 orders of spam musubi w/egg.

After the first batch of tacos came, the wife ordered 2 more. I couldn't get enough chips, guac, and salsa. Next time I will be back to order 6 tacos w/ kimchi just for myself. It was really good!Excellent food, friendly service & excellent pricing! Family owned & operated, this place is just fantastic!Swung by yesterday with the GF to see what all the fuss was about & we were very happy that we did! The staff was very friendly & answered all the questions we had. Every dish they pulled out for guests looked amazing! My GF ordered the Chimichanga & she loved it. There was even a couple sitting by us that asked what that was & they decided to order it! 

Sodas are canned or bottled so if you're used to having 5 drinks at a restaurant (like me) you're gonna end up spending more on sodas than your entree! I recommend this place to anyone wanting to get away from the strip & just relax & enjoy a meal. You can tell there's a lot of pride in this family owned restaurant & we will definitely go back when we are in town!We just moved to Las Vegas a couple of weeks ago.  This park is located only a couple of miles from our house.  It is the perfect place for our 3- and 5-year-old boys to play.  There are a couple of really neat playgrounds and two separate water play areas as well.  There are covered picnic spots, lots of grassy areas to run around in, and gorgeous views of the surrounding mountains.  Could not be more perfect!Ah, there's nothing like the smell of cordite in the morning...

It seems that a lot of the technical info has already been covered. So, that being said... 

This is a great place to take the family! 

Helpful hints: 
Bring your own hearing and eye protection.\ 
Bring your own tape for the targets ( try spray adhesive, it works ) 
Expect it to be windy, and a bit cooler than down in the valley. 
Wear the proper amount of clothing. And closed toe shoes. 
Bring plenty of ammo, water, and snacks. 
Plan on taking your time. Enjoy. Linger. 

Why this place is FUN: 
It is very safe. 
The people who work there are very, very helpful. and Friendly. 
This place is well laid out and well organized. 
You get a great view of the valley. 
The drive up gives you time to clear your head. 
You can shoot anything you bring ( including machine guns, heh heh ) 
They now rent guns. 
You can get your rocks off shooting up targets. 

In my curmudgeonly fashion, I can't let it go without saying bringing some rain down on the parade. 

So here's the bummers: 
It is super noisy and difficult to converse with anyone on the line. 
You do get the macho meat head from time to time ( hey, it is guns, after all ) 
You stand next to someone shooting a .40 Cal ( and did I mention the Noise?! ) 
On occasion you get accosted by sand-devils. 

But on the whole, this is a lot of fun for the whole gun-toting family. It is a heck of a lot cheaper than going to an indoor range. And it's good to get outdoors and enjoy the weather ( while shooting gun, of course ).Well my experience was the opposite of the reviews here. Just needed a basic data SIM for my iPad while visiting from Canada. Friendly, efficient service. Gave me exactly what I needed.Buy 2 teas get 1 free! We ordered the thai tea and a bunch of sandwiches to go. The thai tea was yummy!!! The sandwiches were delicious as well. They didn't skimp on any ingredients and it still tasted great hours later! (We bought them to eat after partying and knew they wouldn't be open that late)Went with friends for Happy Hour Sunday.  We both got the Bob's Big
Burger and split with spouses.  It was absolutely delicious! We were
lucky enough to sit in Cindy's section, and, at her recommendation, got
the Bread Pudding which was the most amazing bread pudding I've ever
had.  She brought out the pastry chef.  Great decor, great service.
We'll be back lots and lots!  Fabulous Happy hour!OH EM GEE!!! Yes it's been that long since we have encountered a perfect bowl of traditional ramen! It left me and we'll mostly hubby speechless with tears of joy that we could finally be reunited with our native flavors. I had the tonkotsu while hubby went for his favorite blend of tonkotsu shoyu and boy was he literally beaming with joy after the first slurp!!

The tamago was great and although the cha siu could'vebeen sliced thicker for my tastes I could've easily went for the kaidama based on our visual appetite, so will certainly be back next time we're in Sin City!This place is awesome! Ive always seen there has been lines out the door soni decided to check out the popularity. The food here is spectacular! Cant wait to eat here again!

Saori is always my sever and she is awesome! Her hospitality is the best. She is super beautiful too! I love you....I mean youre awesome hahaha ;)I just ordered delivery.  It came hot and tasted delicious.  I will order delivery again.Loved it, my favorite is the Tamago Burger and Fukuburger definitely needs a vegetarian burger!. I keep getting the same question every time I recommend Fuku to someone!!.No better way to see the Grand Canyon and Hoover Dam! Our tour guide Kevin was funny, polite, and didn't hit us with constant facts but rather random facts here and there while letting the rest of us to feel free to carry on our own conversations. We got anything and as much food as we wanted at McDonalds for breakfast. When it comes to the actual tour Kevin asked us constantly if we all wanted pictures and knew the best sites to go to for those pictures. The glass observatory deck is breathtaking but if you have a fear of heights may not be your thing. We had a lunch on picnic tables right by the edge of the Grand Canyon which was spectacular. The price of 175.00 a person originally seemed steep but with all the food, the knowledge of the tour, and the length of it being 12 hours - it was well worth it!I must have walked past this small sized yet perfectly formed antique shop on St. Mary's Street a hundred times until I noticed it just last week. Like Neal, I was drawn to the boars head just chilling in a pram, it made me chuckle and I was tempted to follow the instruction to kiss it's snout for luck. When in Rome...

When I popped in for a scout it was a little bit cramped, due to it's small size and abundance of goodies it's a little bit difficult to navigate without following over something or someone, especially when there's more than 5 people inside. 

The following items caught my eye;

-A 1950' picnic set in a wicker basket priced at a very reasonable £39!
-A jug shaped like a stick of celery with eyes, ears, nose and a mouth
-A gasmask...

A rather eclectic mix of products, but interesting nonetheless.

They had an excellent selection of stools, small tables and various small chairs all very reasonably priced so excellent if you're a student and looking for something quirky to brighten up your pad. A saw a pretty white stool with a floral tapestry for only £13! That's very reasonable indeed and it was really cool.

I overheard the shop keeper helping another customer out with an item she was looking at, he was very helpful and it's nice to see an excellent level of customer service. So many antique shops can be run by snooty nosed old gits but the guy working was young and very friendly.UPDATE: This branch is now closed, but you can still shop online and in their Haddington branch.

I do have a strong affinity with this shop because I work there part time. BUT (and it's a big but) I also shop there a lot. Mostly for the seed beads, to which I am addicted, but also for the sterling silver findings (ditto). 
I do shop in other bead stores (sorry boss) but only because no one bead shop can carry every colour of seed bead. For range, prices and service (even when I'm not working), you can't beat The Bead Shop Edinburgh.You have got to try the carne asada quesadilla, I like the flour tortilla with everything on it. 
It is absolutely fabulous!!!I don't always get excited about hot dogs, but this is NOT your typical soggy-bun plus shriveled-dog kind of hot dog stand. They have a variety of meats to choose from, from veggie to brat to spicy beer dog, and a huge list of unique toppings like mango chutney and chipotle cream cheese. My absolute favorite part is the warm fluffy pita bread that your dog comes on instead of a plan old bun.

If you're a Short Leash newbie, try one of their combos like the Aiko, which Brad recommended I try with the spicy dog for a perfect sweet-and-spicy combination. Or go for their featured Dog of the Day, which today was a Greek-style dog with feta and homemade tzatziki sauce. Yum!awrsome place.. great for watching games lots of TVs... and lots of fans... had a great timeThis place is seriously good.  It's kind of like a really good chipotle grill...but actually authentic!  The food is very fresh and flavorful.  The service (been there twice) was really nice.  The prices and portion size are GREAT.  

The only downside, if it is a downside is that the clientele are VERY blue collar.

It is out of my way, but I will go here again and again and again!

Best Mexican in Madison!I look forward to going to Madison so I can stop by Graze. Delicious cheese, booze, and all other locally-sourced edibles makes this one of my favorite spots anywhere, not just in Madison. Maybe it's because I'm not from Wisconsin and I enjoy hearing someone say "this is one of the top-10 cheeses of the year" but I can't get enough of this place.Graze is my favorite local gastropub. It's a great place to take just about anyone--they have dressed-up and dressed-down options, and they can adjust their menu to accommodate everything from veganism to gluten intolerance. Plus, half the dinner menu changes every month or two, so you can go back repeatedly and not see the same things. The other half of the dinner menu stays put, so you have some go-tos if you aren't into options accompanied by root vegetable puree. It can get a little pricey, but there are also cheaper options, so it works out. 

Some of my favorites include the Graze burger and the bibimbap (a spicy Korean dish that's basically meat or tofu + veggies + rice), both of which are on the perennial menu. For appetizers, you can't beat the cheese curds, but the deviled eggs and popcorn sure try. And for dessert, treat yourself to some milk and cookies. They take a bit because they fresh bake them, and they're worth every minute of the wait. 

Besides dinner, Graze has a decadent brunch menu (Nutella French toast, anyone?) and an inventive drinks menu that changes often. They also locally source everything they can.As Jimmy Fallon would say, "So Great!" It is worth the drive off strip to get some good food. The Mac and cheese is outstanding, the fried strips were juicy and awesome, they even have one of those fancy touchscreen coke machines!  I liked the strip sauce and teriyaki.  Staff was friendly. Quaint little joint, will visit again next time in in Vegas.Nothing extraordinary about the taste. Simple delicious classic food. Loved the sweet chili sauce though. However, the service was impeccable. They're friendly, fast and show equal concern towards every customer. It was a complete wonderful experience.Loved staying here as my first trip into Vegas.

The rooms were all vampy and newish. I loved it. The green headboard behind the bed and the little kneeling thingy at the foot of the bed!

I had to call my sister back in Sydney Australia so that I could skype the room to her!

My only embarrassing moment came when after 13 hour flight and 5 hours on a greyhound all I wanted was a hot shower. And I couldn't figure out how to make the shower tap get hot water out.

A shameful call to reception, the woman laughed at me, which was fine. I was laughing at myself at this point! And if I hadn't been laughing I think I'd be crying as all I wanted was a hot shower and bed!

The lovely engineer guy came up and didn't bat at eyelid at the weird Australian woman in her towel looking totally dejected at the shower and showed me how to turn the hot water on. I couldn't get him out of the room quick enough so I could have my shower!

Thank you lovely man for making me the happiest Australian in the joint![This was originally 8k words but I had to fit into 5k]

How doth I love thee? Let me count the ways.

I love thee to the depth and breadth and height--wait--GIRL, I GOT MY HAIR DID. Such is my ecstasy that the feeling of accomplishment is similar to when you're driving a car and you change lanes without hitting any of the markers [YESSSS!]

ARE YOU READY TO JOURNEY UNTO MYSTERY AND ADVENTURE? Thus, it begins:

Upon my arrival, I was inquired if I'd like a beverage [hot, cool, wait, is that a Keurig back there?!] and asked to sit as they retrieved my intended stylist.

HEATHER D. and I cemented ideas and washed my hair. You are given the option of choosing between scents to put into your hair--WHAT IS THIS MAGIC??

I wanted to keep my (waist) length but to cut long layers. Heather said she will cut only the min. needed (so not scissor happy and misinterpreting an inch for four) and that she--without my prompting--would tell me what she was doing so that I would not be overwhelmed [wasn't needed but the consideration was appreciated].

Small talk was nice and not forced as you can be quiet or draw conversation, Heather was very friendly and attentive.

I was given a blowout and was told that the owner, TODD W. will stop by (as he likes to do with all the clients, regardless of stylist) to do finishing touches as needed (it IS his signature cut, understandably).

Todd came by AND SWEET MERCY, YOU MEAN THE OWNER IS NOT SOME OLDER MAN WHO STAYS BEHIND THE SCENES BUT THAT YOUNG ATTRACTIVE MAN WITH FABULOUS HAIR WHO HAS BEEN EVERYWHERE WITH EVERYONE OF WHOM I'VE MISTAKEN IS NOT ACTUALLY ONE OF THE RECEPTIONIST LIKE I INITIALLY THOUGHT? Wait, quick, put on my sunglasses and fluff up my hair while they walk over!

Oh Todd, dear sweet Mr White. How could I ever describe this magnificent and creative man? 

I cannot fathom the words as to express the greatness that was my experience.

Heather was my Obi-Wan but Todd was the freakin' Yoda. Heather did a fantastic cut, I thought it couldn't get better but Todd starts dry cutting (with my approval to suggestions) and the entire cut turned from PERFECT to SOMETHING-MAGICAL-IS-HAPPENING. I would think it's done then he would find a rebel strand and obliterate it to kingdom come. My sweets, this man is the kind of stylist you want. A perfectionist. He will not stop until he is satisfied, and that man has high expectations! 

Heather, Todd and I would converse about my endgame in future sessions, and he would spout some technical cosmetic jargon to Heather as the plan. I could not be more ecstatic. So many techniques and specificity that I totally eavesdropped on, I was in Hair Heaven. I was internally drooling by this time but didn't want to show my inner fangirl just yet. 

Now, what I say next will not always be the rule and it might've been an exception so don't expect Todd to be able to cater to your every needs, girls and boys, because he is still a very busy man.

I was driving away when I forgot I wanted a picture with them to commemorate my finding of The One (salon) for me. When I had came back, Todd was busy with consulting another client but Heather kept me company and I didn't mind waiting.

Picture time! Todd was fluffing my hair [darn car AC, must you act like a hurricane?] when he noticed ('Do you see what I see, Heather?') ... Dundundunnnn.. A rebel layer! JESUS TAKE THE WHEEL, CAN I BRING THESE TWO HOME WITH ME, PRETTY PLEASE? Back to the chair for an impromptu cut [at this point, I'm not sure if it was noticeable but I was literally shaking with endorphins because I was just so damn happy, I could not believe my luck in searching literally for years--and growing my hair one length to have a blank canvas for my future cut--and to find my perfectionistic stylists.. I could cry, seriously. This is a damn dream come true and I almost, ALMOST didn't write this review because my newfound love for them is at that stage where I DO NOT WANT TO SHARE. ... But HOW COULD I CONTAIN SUCH ADMIRATION FOR THESE TWO BEAUTIFUL [no, really, why are they so pretty??] AND TALENTED PEOPLE?!

Impromptu cut ended & pictures finally taken.

Thus, this chapter of the story has ended, my sweet searching audience. If you want perfection, Platinum Entourage is the place to go. Everyone is easy going, don't be afraid. You're not going to lose an arm and leg through prices, ask if you're unsure.

No, but seriously, I'm not telling you to go but just saying how the entire experience was for me. Whether or not you find that as an incentive to go is entirely up to you.

Heather, Todd; my most sincere and deepest gratitude for the cut and I hope to see you guys soon for the color. I honestly cannot put to words how much finally finding you two means to me that only after one day, I trust you guys to recommend me to the right person if you two suddenly wanted to retire into the Bahamas [please don't, not until I have sunshine hair please]. Thank you.What a great show!   I loved every minute of it and it was so entertaining and upbeat.  Donny & Marie are all grown up now.  My bf brought me to see this against his wishes but he ended up liking it as most men do after being dragged in by their dates.

Marie sang opera!  I have to say this was my very favorite part of the show.  She has an amazing operatic voice and her performance took my breath away.  She looks great and even Dale says she looks like a mannequin.

Donny was great too.  He's charming and handsome.  I loved the way they showed old footage to add to some of the songs.  

I could take a way a star but don't want to because the seating sucked.  We paid a lot of money for our tickets and sat in a booth meant for petite people which we are not.  I dont' think a lot of people liked their seats because most everyone looked uncomfortable being sideways and having to stretch necks to see the stage.  

Other than that, it was a fun night I'm glad I got to see that particular show.  Go and see them, they're not as bubble gum anymore!Finding a doctor is always nerve-wracking. I was a patient here for nearly 6 years before moving to New Mexico. Dr. Sakon was my doctor from day 1. He delivered both my children, stayed on top of my medical needs, preformed a LEEP procedure and helped me through a miscarriage. I liked that Dr. Sakon is vey matter- of- fact.  I rarely had to wait more than 20 minutes for an appointment. The office staff was always friendly.  I can't think of a single bad experience in all of my time at this office  (I was there A LOT). I've referred several friends to West End OBGYN and they have all had positive experiences as well (with Sakon and the other doctors).GreatCame here for a second time because I just couldn't leave Vegas without visiting MB again! 

Tried the White Chocolate Chai, fondue for 2, and had some sips of the White Russian and Chocolate Martini ... needless to say, MMMmm....

I especially loved the quirky contraption for the Chai, where you would put the pot on top of the glass and press down to drip the chai into the glass. It was delicious, more on the sweet side though, but probably one of the best Chai's I've ever had. 

the White Russian and Chocolate Martini were both tasty but not that memorable for me.

There's two types of fondue, one where there's more items to dip and one where there's more than one tub of chocolate. I personally like the fondue with more items to dip and just ordered an extra tub of chocolate for $4.50 Wish there was more marshmallows to dip because those are my favorite!! Expect an assortment of chocolates, wafers, fruits, and this waffle ice cream thing. So so sweet, in a good way :)

This place isn't cheap, as you would expect from the fact that it's on the strip, in Caesar. But it's worth it, come with friends, it's so tasty!The best fast food burger joint in the country as far as I'm concerned.  I can't wait until they make their way to Houston...it shouldn't be too long now!Shawna is THE BEST! We adopted a 1 1/2 year old mastiff who had never been trained before. We took Shawna's beginner's class and quickly learned how to train our stubborn dog. He went from being pretty unmanagable to a (mostly) well-behaved dog, with Shawna's help. I have referred friends to her, and I'd highly, highly recommend her. She knows great tricks and tips for each breed of dog and she quickly had Toby eating out of her hand (literally!!). Shawna's classes are extremely effective - I wouldn't go anywhere else. She's great!!updated review after a couple of years of going there almost every week!

Simply the best place to eat in Arizona period. It is everything you would want from a true NY style deli/restaurant with a fresh and healthy update. Top quality food, bagels made on premise (TRUE NY bagles, dont know how they do it!), great services and very friendly- family owned!

You can sit inside or outside in sidewalk cafe style. A dream come true, everything you would want from a NY cafe but local.What a great local little brewery. it's tucked away in an odd part of town off 25th ave and Van Buren, but don't let the surroundings fool you. this is a great litle brewery with awesome beers. The wife and I purchased a Living Social deal and got two flights, a tour and each a monogrammed pint glass for around $20. All the beers were great. My two favories were the Irish Red Ale and the awesome Dark Knight Porter. The staff is super friendly, the brewer there was great at giving us all the beer facts during the tour and the place just seemed like a place you could hang and have a few cold ones. I'll be back for sure. For all you craft beer afficionados. this is a hidden GEM!!!If you're near downtown Las Vegas and looking for something fun to eat, Cheffini's hot dog cart is unbeatable. The guy running the cart is affable and entertaining, and the dogs are spot-on. There are a number of non-traditional topping available for the dogs (potato chips, anyone), so you can customize to your stomach's content. Plus, the clientele provides a show of its own.

Great place!I don't always give five stars.  Check!  I only do it when a company truly deserves the rating, and The Phoenix Pool Boys do.  I'm in real estate and have had to interact with many pool companies.  I have seen many of them go to a house to clean the pool and they're out of there in five minutes.  A quick swipe of the pool net to remove debris, a quick brush of the sides (if you're lucky), two chlorine tablets dropped in the filter basket and they're GONE.  Not the Phoenix Pool Boys.  They take their time to make sure the pool is truly cleaned.  And if you hire them to keep the chemicals balanced, they will make sure it is.  Try the Phoenix Pool Boys and happy swimming.The menu is somewhat limited but what they do offer is excellent!This place has been set up for organized chaos. There were 3 lines. Each one was for a specific type of meat. The line for the al pastor was the longest of the three.  The man was amazingly quick.  Made the tortillas warm, carved off some meat, scooped some onions, salsa and a guacamole crema. My sister was in line for the lengua. This server was just as quick and efficient. After getting our tacos, paid and got seated at one of the few empty seats. Started with the lengua. The lengua was not tough at all. Melt in your mouth amazing. The tortillas were full of flavor and the salsa was a perfect match.  Then went on to the al pastor. The flavor of the meat was great. The meat was tender and the sauces made it even better. The tortillas was dunked in the juices from the al pastor. Had this meal at 12:30am and I was already full but it was so worth it. I heard that the one near the Wynn always had a line for the lengua and the shorter lines were for the other meats. The location is a bit far off since it is in downtown but it is worth the drive. Definitely going to try to come back. Puts LA taco trucks to shame.Great atmosphere and consistently good coffee!   I love that 10 percent of their sales go toward providing clean water for people living in 3rd world countries.  Certainly a great LOCAL alternative to Starbucks.If you asked me to name all of the things I missed about Illinois, I might need two hands, but I'd have a few fingers left over.  Jimmy John's, however, would be one of those things I missed.

The employees are great- They're fast, they've got personality, and always have a smile on their face.

They make the bread fresh in the store; sometimes when they hand you your sandwich, and the bread is still warm from the oven?  That's the greatest.

Just hold the mayo (not a mayo fan)!The new owners of this place really put their heart, soul and what sounds like a few layers of skin into fixing up the place. It's been closed for quite a while. They have cleaned, painted, cleaned, renewed and cleaned the place! It's a little loud when you have many people in there, but worth the trip. There are TVs everywhere including a large center screen. The staff is friendly as well. I tried the turkey wrap, as is. They add dried cranberries to the wrap...wasn't sure how that was going to taste. After the first bite I was hooked! On the menu they have sliders (Philly cheez, burger or grilled cheese), apps, salads (including a grilled romaine salad that I've heard is to die for), sandwiches, pizza and more! There is a separate kids menu too. They are going to serve food late too - hard to find in that area. Definitely check this place out - even just to see what work was done.I followed a trainer from another gym here and I took her Saturday 8AM class and what a wonderful workout I got, a class that you burn the fat and boy I felt like the fat was burning all day.   I get really bored at a regular gym so I love Group Training with variety of exercises which included on my workout which of course they would change ropes, jumping, burpees and so much more.  What I love is the trainer motivating us during the workout.  At times since I am out of shape I wanted to stop, but the trainer was behind me pushing me and that helped me get through the workout.  The gym is really big with high ceilings and a lot of room for big classes.  They even have an area for sports performance training which I am excited to get my daughter to get involved in since she is in soccer and this added training would be good for her.  The Group Training classes currently are M-F 6AM and 11AM and Saturdays at 8AM.  They will be adding more classes.  There is plenty of parking.  You have to check them out!Went here for the great groupon offering that I found - well worth it!  First of all, this is not Afghan food - this is Mediterranean and Persian.  (hopefully you true foodies out there know the difference).

We went on a Tuesday evening and I had the Tuesday special - a delicious Persian stew that I would order again and again.  

This is not a fancy place to go, but the food is tasty.  It's like the McD's equivalent of the nearby Persian Room!  

Definitely go if you are in the area.  It's worth it.We went on Aug 26, my good looking friend Christopher and I, had a GREAT time.  It was made possible by our wonderful photographer/ice queen hostess "with the mostess" Jessenia.  You gotta check this place out...be sure to tell Jessenia we said "HEY" from North Carolina...and leave her a BIG TIP!  She rocks....and so did the hot bartender...parka and all.  This is a MUST DO to beat the hot Vegas streets.I took my dogs to the Town center Animal Hospital today for the 1st time.I was impressed with the friendly service on the phone .The office was really easy to find with the very good directions I was given.When we got there I was greeted quickly by more of their helpful friendly staff.They were all great with my dogs,and one of them can be quite a hand full .The doctor ,Dr. Cordeiro,was very patient , knowledgeable ,and good with my dogs.She gave mes a couple different treatment options and prices for each .The prices were exactly what they quoted without extra charges thrown in which always seemed to happen at the other place we used to take them.With the great people and great prices ,I can't imagine going any place else.- It's good, authentic (Cantonese?) food at great prices.
- My cousin-in-law (from Hong Kong) always wants to eat here when he's in town.
- The service is hit and miss, so it's pretty standard for an Asian eatery.We are currently renting our house that is so full of carpet.  (Whoever thought of laying fabric on floors was a crazy person, obviously.)  After more than six months of living in the house, the high traffic areas had become dingy or almost black near the entrance from the garage and front door.  We researched reputable carpet cleaners from big name companies like Stanley Steemer to other local businesses.  We decided on Turbo Clean due to the affordability and reviews from Yelp.

We called on a Friday and set up an appointment for just a few days later. (They are very accommodating on times and availability.)  Without asking they told us that they were running a special and though we were not sure on the square footage of exactly what we needed, they would accommodate us and give us the special anyway.  We were quoted at $155 for two floors and a set of stairs, which was at least half of what Stanley Steemer was going to charge us.

Today our technician showed up promptly and was so cool.  We chatted the whole time about carpet care, the business, equipment, and anything else I had questions about.  The tool that he used looked like and ran like a floor buffer, but for carpet.  He "buffed" the floor and immediately the carpet came back to life and was so vivid again.  Though he stated that the blackened area near the garage would not look brand new, he would do his best, he assured.  (Frankly, I appreciate honesty!)  As it turns out, the carpet there actually looks amazing and better than I expected!  On the stairs, he cleaned each individual stair with amazing attention and scrubbed the hell out of each one by hand with a smaller tool.  The stairs are so incredibly soft and fluffy.  Who would have thought?!  Now, the carpet looks better than when we moved in.

The tech finished in around 90 minutes, assuring me that the carpet would be dry by the late evening.  Well, only about five hours later and the carpets are almost completely dry and look amazing.  He charged the exact quoted price and never tried to up-sell me or anything.

I am all about supporting passionate, small businesses with honest, knowledgeable, and hardworking people.  Turbo Clean is an excellent business with affordable services, amazing results, and better equipment from what I can tell.Talk about hiding your light under a bushel! 

This little cafe-style restaurant is tucked away in a little side-street in shabby Tollcross. Have faith, though, because this place is stellar. Indaba is very casual cafe-style inside with loads to look at - from the light fittings to the iguanas on the wall. 

The food is seriously good. The three owners are influenced by their countries of origin - South African, Spanish, Venezuelean - and have adapted their dishes by incorporating Scottish ingredients. I have never had haggis with spinach and pine nuts before, but I'll happily re-visit Indaba to have it again. The ribs are just divine. 

These are generous tapas portions, so that if you order 2 or 3 each, you'll end up - as we did - with a fabulously varied feast on the table before you. Each dish different, expertly cooked, and with the flavours perfectly balanced. 

It's not often I find myself quitely obsessing about a restaurant, but I certainly do with Indaba, and can't wait for another visit.The Persimmon Dining Room is located in the Anthem Country Club. Their Patio offers a classic ambiance with spectacular views of the 18th fairway and is a perfect setting for watching Arizona's beautiful desert Sunsets. The menu provides variety, a contemporary flair and memorable Sophistication, and the wine list and liquor selections appeal to a wide variety of tastes. All of the services and facilities at this Clubhouse are designed with the goal and spirit of providing it's Members and their guest with the enjoyment of an inviting yet unpretentious setting.Discovered this place when we were craving mexican food at work one day. My co-worker, who is a native to AZ and has worked by Los Taquitos for the past 5 years, had never been, and always wondered about it as it is located in a strip mall. We were worried and questioned it, but when we got there for lunch, there was a line almost out the door. They get very busy during the lunch rush, but it is well worth it. I have tried a few things, but the Chili rellano burrito is the only thing I order now. You can buy their homemade tortillas as well. My parents always ask me to bring some with when I visit. Definitely worth trying out!I've never really been a fan of Diners, Drive-ins and Dives, however when I saw the segment featuring Los Taquitos I had to go.  Absolutely the finest, most delicious wonderful Mexican food I have ever experienced.  The staff, professional, hard-working and courteous.  They are so proud of their business and for good reason.  That made me smile.  I'm definitely a permanent customer.  Everything was fantastic!This was my first experience cracking whole crabs and is was great.  Fresh, tasty and extra affordable on Tuesdays. It's a great spot to eat when you have some time to roll up your sleeves and get messy.Crab Corner was so impressive the first time we ate there, my wife and I went back with our friends the next night. 

just a great restaurant! The crab is awesome. Tried all their crab... Blue Crab was excellent and very authentic Maryland style. The king crab was juicy and sweet. Add seasoning and butter and it's probably the best king crab I've ever had. 

I usually don't care for snow crab but Crab Corner nailed it perfect. Sweet and juicy. 

Definitely ask for a bib because it will get messy. 

Crab Corner is a different style vs Hot n Juicy, so it's not quite fair to compare.i had heard stories about the portions here so I had to see it for myself.

First off I love the M, it reminds me of MGM Detroit back home, not too big, but still very nice.

The Hash House is placed at the North-end of the property so many of the window seats have excellent views of Las Vegas and the modern pool area below.  You'd think a fine dining place would be here but it's not and I'm OK with that!

The first time I came here I had the chicken and waffles.  They were good but not as amazing as I had heard of, but I still had plenty of leftovers for a meal the next day, so no complaints.

My second visit I had the bacon mashed potato burger which weighs in at 1+ lbs AND you get fries (and the dinner rolls before).  I definitely get a craving for this once and awhile and for the price of around $15 you can't beat it!  Seriously most of the burgers around town are $10+ and are way smaller.  The first time I ate this I only got halfway through, second time I finished it!

I would like to come here for breakfast since I hear that is their specialty.  I'm sure some items on the menu are better than others, however I can guarantee you that you won't leave hungry!Words cannot even express how this place has changed my view on crepes. 

I am not even a crepe fan at all. Normally I do not enjoy the taste nor the texture of most crepes I've tried in the past. Most crepes have this eggy taste, which I don't like at all. I was actually going to order a waffle, but according to fellow yelpers they do not recommend it. So what the heck, I ordered the apple a la mode crepe. 

I noticed while waiting, the waffles often broke in the waffle maker and the guy behind the counter had to make a new one each time that happened. What a hassle, made me feel bad for him because I know how much of pain it is when that kind of thing happens. 

Now on to the crepe! I had high expectations for this place to begin with because everyone I knew who lived in Henderson had already been here. In addition, all the reviews on yelp were good. As I mentioned earlier I ordered the apple a la mode crepe and I was in absolute awe within the first bite. The combination of ice cream, apple, gram cracker, whipped cream was absolutely amazing. The crispness from apples and the crunch of the gram cracker was a nice combination. Plus the ice cream and whipped cream was like a glue that blended everything nicely together inside the crepe. The texture of the crepe was smooth like silk (yes, I am serious!) and the taste of it was not eggy at all. Back in January I had a crepe from Jean Philippe Patisserie in Bellagio and I probably liked this crepe from Crepe Shack more. To top it off, I think eating it in your hand rather than on a plate with fork makes it a more enjoyable experience. 

Woot! Can't wait to come back to try the banana foster and east meets west crepes.Dear Lord...I was lost and then I was found after having the Camp Out S'more Japanese Crepe. The marshmallows, graham cracker crumbs, chocolate sauce, whipped cream and vanilla ice cream were like a dessert nirvana. 

It was quite crowded when we went at 1:30pm....the local school was getting out. I was impressed how quickly the staff worked and we had our crepes within 7 min...which is a perfectly acceptable wait time in my mind. Also...I must commend the kids...they were all well behaved and very respectful...nice to see. Will be back VERY soon for the Camp Out S'more.Been coming here for a little less then a year now after my barber moved. Been seeing Izzy every two weeks for a fresh hair cut. izzy is one of the most talented barbers  I have ever come across. I highly recommend this place.This place is so charming! The owner is as sweet as her French Macarons! My favorites are Vanilla and Coffee. I'm so excited to try some more!The best bakery in vegas hands down. I introduce everyone I know to this place. I have to send macaroons to family members because they love this place. Especially my friend from France says this is just like home so that speaks volumes!Sara is an amazing and intuitive massage therapist.  She has a great sense of the body and how to seek out my problem areas, and really gives such a great overall experience.  I reccomend her highly!  I've been to many massage therapists in my time- and no one was able to completely relax me like Sara.  Make that appointment today...Great service!!!  Stopped by in the am to price out tires, came back in the afternoon to purchase them and they were out of the tires we had talked about. We were offered a better tire for the same price quoted. They really took care of us, in and out with 2 new tires in less than a half an hr!!My daughter and I do what we call a "backwards" dinner about one a month.  We have dessert first and then have dinner.  It's fun and breaks things up a little. I try to make it frozen yogurt because then I don't feel so guilty for eating dessert first.  We had been watching and waiting for Yo Love to open since it's just up the street from our place. Of course they opened when we were out of town!  Tonight we got to try it!!  It was fantastic!!  We were warmly greeted when we walked in and given several sample cups to try the 12 flavors they have.  Yes, 12!!  Tonight they had Double Chocolate, Irish Mint, Tiramisu, New York Cheesecake, Yellow Cake Batter, Tart, Fresh Strawberry, Pecan Praline, and Pumpkin Pie just to name a few.  Every one I tried was delicious!  I had a hard time deciding but finally got the New York Cheesecake and Pecan Praline, which was non-fat, no sugar added but you sure couldn't tell!  It was so good!  My daughter got the Hawaiian Delight frozen sorbet.  Over at the topping bar they had all the usual toppings and my personal favorite, frosted animal crackers!!  I love those silly things!  

It's a new store so the inside is spotless but I have a feeling it will stay that way. There is plenty of room to get your yogurt and everything is nicely laid out.  There are two walls that separate the yogurt from the seating area.  The walls are made for dry erase markers and there are cups full of them mounted on both walls.  What a great idea!  My daughter thought this was great fun.  There is also a computer set up for guest use and free WiFi!  The tables and chairs have a whimsical feel to them with brightly colored seat pads on the chairs and glass table tops. The light fixtures remind me of strawberries. There are flat screen TVs also.  While we were there they played music videos. 

Dale, the owner, was so nice and I told him to look for us often since we lived close by. And I saved the best for last....a rewards card!!!  Yes, buy 9 get the 10th free!  YAY! This will be the place to hang out in the summer!!  Cool treats to beat the heat!!  I'm so glad Dale brought Yo Love to our neighboorhood!!  Thanks Dale!This place is awesome. Really great food ad they cater to customers like me with dietary restrictions. I will definitely be back :-)AMAZING! Yum-o. Best orange chicken I have ever had in my life. I highly recommend this to EVERYONE.Love this place. DEFINITELY get the D-box upgrade for action movies. Worth it! It is pricier than some of the theaters, but why not. You get to reserve your seats, you can get a cup of coffee and a legit meal. Also the employee's are nice people!I'm pretty sure that today we visited the most magical place on earth besides Disneyworld. It was magical in a very different way, though... it was beautiful, peaceful, and way more than I was expecting.

A group of us visited Jam today to get some work done together and have a relaxing afternoon, but I'm pretty sure none of us were ready for all of the great things that ended up taking place. Jam is a gorgeous, historical home with a white picket fence and small front yard. The place is just overflowing with character... and that's just on the outside! The inside is filled with jewelry, trinkets, pieces from artists, and things that will inspire you to be more creative. I'm not big on "energy" and different moods that places can possess, but I'm still smiling from this afternoon. 

The "meeting room" is a perfect spot for a long get-together and the windows can be opened to let the breeze in, which obviously is a much better choice than sitting in a stuffy corporate conference area. The whole house had 70 degree temps blowing through every room! We also were lucky enough to be given homemade lemonade which was a perfect compliment to the sunny weather outside.

If I lived in Phoenix, I'd go take all of the classes that Shauna (the lovely, lovely owner) told us about. Make sure to see what they have coming up. Regardless, stop by to shop, be inspired, have a meeting, do some work, whatever you need to do. We need a place like this in St. Louis. For a few hours, I forgot about every stress and worry in my world... and that's priceless.Girl's trip to Vegas.  Lots of shopping and good food.  Best meal of trip was Lakeside.  Hubs and I had visited about 4 weeks prior and had a great experience so wanted to try it again.  It did not disappoint.  Our waiter, David (same as first trip) was marvelous. Very patient, explained menu perfectly and  allowed us to share a couple of plates off the raw menu!  We were in heaven. The Ahi Sashimi was totally mind blowing!  If you eat raw you will love it.   Didn't find it overly expensive, and we even enjoyed a sommelier recommended white burgundy.  Can't wait to go back!This is by far the best massage experiance (for the money) I have found after 25 of years in Las Vegas. Thank you Yelp! After reading the reviews, I decided to check it out  and was not only given a great massage, but when I checked in on my Yelp app, I was sent a text offering me a 42% discount! I had a 90 minute full body massage, fully clothed with only needing to remove y socks and shoes for a nice warm foot soak while two different therapist worked over my aching body. I will be a regular patron and highley recommend for those on a budget that may need a little holiday stress reliefAnother amazing massage.  Winnie and Mae were phenomenal. Thank you both ladies again! I highly highly recommend this place to anybody in the area . They are the best!I am a huge fan of Urban Outfitters clothing in general. They sometimes have questionable business practices and can be quite culturally insensitive, but purely based on clothing, I love them.

With regard to this location, I felt compelled to write about their great customer service. Every time I have gone in here, I have felt very welcomed and supported in my purchases and returns. And I am not an easy customer. I shop online a lot and am always returning/exchanging items. But they are always so helpful and nice, I just love them. This is very unlike the Scottsdale Urban Outfitters experience where it seems like they want nothing to do with you and are too cool for school. This location, though, 5 stars for service. Thanks, guys!!Highly recommend! Never been to one of these places. Eric is a very nice and professional.  Great value 20.00 for hour massage, very peaceful, relaxing and clean. 
Treat yourself and support local business!I've definitely put my phone through a lot ! To the point where every time I dropped it more cracks and huge spider webs would appear. Even glass coming out. I went on yelp to help me find a good place with great service and deals. I went to one place before in china town but their was price was ridiculous (almost $80 for my iPhone 4) and service was boring. But then I came across this place. 
AMAZING! It was a little difficult to find this place because there weren't any signs but once I walk in I felt so welcomed. Mai helped me through my entire visit. She was so sweet and always smiled. She gave me a great deal ($49) to fix my cracked screen and since I checked in on yelp, I got a free iPhone case AND a screen protector!
I think my visit was about 30-40 minutes long but it was totally worth it. My phone looks brand new :) Mai was such a wonderful help I'm definitely coming back to get my boyfriend's iPad screen fixed! Thank you Mai and to your wonderful team also!best place ever !!Now this is what you call a burger joint!!!! Best veggie burger I'd ever had. You can clearly tell this wasn't your average frozen veggie burger gone warm on a grill.  This thing had real veggie flavors and real texture.  Nice and hearty and thick just as I was eating a piece of meat :)

I didn't care too much for the french fries or onion rings. The french fries were just french fries.  Nothing to call home about. The onion rings were deep friend too much and you couldn't enjoy it without it crumbling all over you.  

The milkshakes were G.R.E.A.T!!!!  They had an array of flavors that I'd never seen before.  It was heaven.Holsteins has the best burgers in Vegas.  They are fun, different and very flavorful.  The oreo shake was so creamy and good, I am usually not a fan of oreo, but my husband got it and I ended up drinking most of it, because I liked it so much that I didn't let him have it back.  I got the Gold Standard burger which was really good.  I had done a lot of research on the best burgers to eat in Vegas and settled on Holsteins, it was an excellent choice and I will eat there every time I visit Vegas.  They also do deals on Groupon, which is nice.My girl just had her Bachelorette in Vegas and we came to Comme Ca for group dinner.  12 girls!  They gave us a private room so we can be as loud and disgusting as we wanted to be.  Great service!  The waitress told us to take pictures outside on the patio and she even took the picture for us.  

Food: We did family style because the night before we ate a Society at Encore and got too stuffed we couldn't get drunk at the clubs haha...
Appetizers..Started with Bone marrow.  Comes with a side of what seems to be beef cheeks or some kind of beef meat that is tender and in small pieces.  Out of this world!  Followed by the roasted beet salad...standard.  Goat cheese and candied walnuts.  Pretty good but not AMAZING...Next was the Mussels and i think this was one of the three dishes that i was not too fond of.  The mussels were small and the wine sauce was bland.  Followed by the Foie Gras. Bomb ass liver!!!  It was thick and the fat was pouring out of my little piece...(it was shared by five girls i could have eaten one complete serving myself!)  Lastly Pate...tasted more like gnawed up meat with a lot of black pepper in it.  Not a fan of this.

Entrees: Handmade Stuffed pasta with escargot and bacon in a mushroom sauce with mushrooms. :) love!  If you are not a fan of snail...dont worry there is no funky texture or even taste.  My friend hates snail and she ate it and loved it.  Next we had the mushroom risotto with truffel flakes!  Need i say more? I licked the plate clean after everyone had their share.  On to the Meats...Hammered Veal...skip.  Didn't like the stringy texture of the meat again it was in "dog food form".  It does taste ok flavor wise but texture just threw me.  Last we had the beef cheeks.  Full of flavor and tender with lots of veggies on the side.  Very delicious!

Service A+,Food A, Atmosphere A...LOVE $700 for a party of 12! WE also got shots of goose and pineapple chases... Great deal on the strip.Comme ca is one of the best French restaurants located on the strip.

Food:
We had...

Dozen oysters
Filet mignon
Bouillabaisse
Ratatouille
Beer cheddar grits

The dozen oysters were delicious, they were so fresh its as if they took it out of the sea and opened it right then and there; absolutely to die for. My advice: When asked if you'd like them from the East or West coast, choose the East. Although they are smaller they are richer in flavor and the texture, ohhh the texture.. 

Filet mignon was melt in your mouth and the bone marrow complimented the beef so well its as if they were meant to be together.

Ratatouille and beer cheddar grits were delicious though I wouldn't recommend ordering them unless you have someone share it with you. Portions are about a half cup each and you wouldn't want the food to go to waste! Sharing is caring! ;)

The bouillabaisse was a bit bland but the fish soup base was creamy and rich. The mussels, fish, clams, and shrimp were perfectly cooked. Combined with the grits it was heaven!!

Bottom line:
Fresh seafood, great food, FANTASTIC service, and a lovely lovely lovely view of the strip. What more is there to ask for?Moco loco burger is the BEST SAVORY burger in town! But caution folks, just one per two weeks or even a month is more than enough...!!!!!

This crazy place about local food even makes its own house burrata!! If you haven't tried it (OMG WHY NOT!), its this awesome creamy cheese that lets you spread it over whatever you want. I mean, I like the Italian original at Osteria better, but hey, this is probably as good as local gets!

Pastas are always good here too. It's more American Italian, but at least ingredients and flavors are awesome!

Drinks are always good!!! Anything with an egg white is DELICIOUS!! 

I'm not sure I like the atmosphere after 10:30pm on Fridays and Saturdays.. It's more like a club. Very loud music and you have to stand around. Definitely not where I would go to chill out with friends and chat.. But hey, maybe that's your scene.

Always packed on weekends during dinner. so make a reservation! AND it's on open table too!

Also, look out for the daily specials! Mondays you get burger specials with beer, Tuesdays date night... And other special events ;)Good Peppermint mocha hook up on my way back to San Diego! :)~~~5 Stars, Hands Down.

5 Stars for both their lunch and dinner options 
(Yes, I've been to both and both multiple times.)

Vegas buffet checklist: Wynn, Bellagio, Caesars, Rio, Treasure Island...Wicked Spoon wins hands down.

If I go to Vegas, this is where to go for a buffet.

Service: Great! They are quick with refilling your drinks, changing up your drink if you wanna change it up, refilling water (in addition to your soda/alcoholic beverage), and FRIENDLY!

Food: Honestly, the best out of any Vegas buffet I've tried.
-- tapas style: BRILLIANT
why? you don't overwhelm yourself scooping up huge portions and letting your hungry eyes fill up your plate. makes you less wasteful and gives you more room to try all the delicious things.

Their carving station honestly takes a dump on other buffets; particularly, their lunch menu offerings.
(LUNCH) - tri-tip, sliced bacon, italian sausage
(DINNER) - prime rib...which yes, every buffet has. but the Wicked Spoon prime rib is mouth watering and always fresh. never dry looking or unappetizingly greasy (the look it gets when the fat starts hardening)

Cool things:
(LUNCH) 
- smoked salmon sashimi style!! (wynn offers this as a dinner time highlight, and the wicked spoon offers this during lunch!!!)
- make your own omelet bar
- expensive cheeses

(DINNER)
- make your own mac and cheese, it's pretttttty bomb
- honestly...besides their pizza selection...everything they offer during dinner is great. which i cannot say about any other vegas buffet. most places have their specialty, a really crappy asian food section and an even worse and extremely bland italian pasta section. the wicked spoon breaks all rules when it comes to this generality and they provide great everything

(DESSERT)
- where do i begin...
- macarons, gelato (with bombbb flavors), small samples of greatness (don't miss out on the strawberry cheesecake cups with marshmallow toppings), chocolate covered strawberries with almonds and oreo crumbles...the list just never ends.

bottom line: if you're in vegas and want to eat at a buffet...make it the wicked spoon.This buffet has become my ultimate favorite in Vegas! :) 

I came here on a weekday for a brunch. So yes...there is breakfast and lunch being served. 

What I love about this place is their presentation of their food. They are served in portions, that way you can have a little bit of everything. Like everyone else, their desserts are to die for ranging from macaroons, gelato ice cream, chocolate covered strawberries, and so much more. 

It is awesome when you come here with friends because you will all be recommending dishes to try and talk about how good the food is. 

Although it may be pricey, the quality of the food is unique and presentable. :)This buffet was the best we tried in Las Vegas this trip.  I was pleasantly surprised by the wide variety of options available, much of the food was being prepared in front of us and they have an A rating, which they've posted everywhere.  The atmosphere is beautiful, the service is pleasant and the food is damn good.  Don't try to eat one of each of the desserts, though, you won't make it.Best buffet in Vegas!!!
Took my sister here for her birthday...good food, good deserts well worth the price!!!The Hub Deli is excellent!  No exceptions.  The owners seem pretty keen on attention to detail AND also to customer service.  

(FYI: I met the younger "blonde" lady & she is very friendly, attentive to service & order accuracy.) 

Today was my long awaited second time in and I found a new favorite place in Ahwatukee. I fell in love with the interior design, energy & atmosphere.  It's fun, yet professional and has an independent vibe which I *crave!* 

The sandwich I had was " The Hippie," I added turkey & decided to put the hot pepper relish on the side.  I loved it all!!! One of the very best / fave sandwiches I have ever eaten. Seriously. Perfection. 

Now the cookies, the *free* chocolate chip cookies....I need more of!!! I want to buy a dozen if possible!  Nothing that tasted this good should be *free!* I am not a "big" girl, but these cookies would have me gain quite a few pounds if my will power & wallet would allow. YUM. I could write just about the cookie.  My friend has one left & if he's not careful *I will* steal it!

In closing to this long adoringly yet ranting review:
I  support *all things local* (except franchises!) and now the Hub has given me one more reason *not* to despise living in Ahwatukee....(culture-less void....or maybe it has potential:)   With the farmer's market on Sun's @ 48th & Warner, The Hub Deli, Pomegranate Cafe, even Trader Joe's and 24 Carrots down the street (on Chandler Blvd.)....one can only hope for the latter!

Forget Jason's Deli! Support The HUB instead! I am certain that it has the potential to be a "hub" for Ahwatukee foodies & denizens alike!

Also,  be sure to grab a treat & a tea or coffee from Pomegranate Cafe while you're in the neighborhood!  

Enjoy, locally!!!The location itself is beautiful.  Even before I was gone on drinks I could stare at the chandelier above the bar area for hours.  The seats are plush and the bar area itself extremely comfortable.  

The selection is expensive, but that's a given in Vegas.  Service was super prompt at the bar area.  The bartender was nice enough to check in on me once I was getting lush.  The drinks are strong.  My lemon drop felt like 3 martinis in one glass.  Good thing I had just enough memory to order some water, pay my tab, and tip my bartender before I staggered down to the casino floor.  

No doubt this is a fancy bar/lounge area.  It's a nice spot to wind down after too much gambling or to ramp your self up to start a long night in Vegas.  The location is also prime to explore the other parts of the Cosmopolitan.This place totally rocks!  Lindsay is awesome behind the bar. Extremely welcoming and sweet. Not to mention she can make some GREAT drinks. Must ask her for the Verbina. Thanks also to Marina for letting us try her new Thanksgiving drink. It was unbelievably delicious!  GREAT EXPERIENCE!This bar visit was amazing.  I went on 8/25 Saturday night, found a seat and was greeted right away by a nice lady with a big smile.  I asked if she could make a Ramos gin fizz and away to work she went.  I am going through some crazy bad stuff in my life right now and it was nice for it to all dissapear for that one drink.  I will go back when my life is right.  When I open my own bar, I want it to be like the Vesper.After dining at e' in May, I was looking foward to eating in the main restaurant that houses e'- Jaleo. Me and my new wife shared I believe nine courses and seven were slam-bang. Chorizo wrapped with crispy potato chips, salmon tartare in cones, bread with tomato and anchovie, dungeoness crab- stuffed piquillo peppers, garlic soup with egg, jamon iberico (the really good stuff from the acorn-fed black-footed pigs- forget the exact Spanish name) are just some of the wonderful food we had there. It was an exciting progression of courses akin to a tasting menu that we shared- for a fraction of the price of a michelin- starred restaurant. With drinks, I'm actually shocked that all this great food and the tip ended up being less than $200.What an amazing new restaurant in Vegas!

First things first- yes, prices are high in Vegas as it's a tourist location.  Honestly, if you go and visit, there are a lot of places you can go to keep it reasonable- you just have to find them.  :)

That being said, Jaleo isn't someplace I would put in that category.  I LOVE the food here, the atmosphere- everything about it.  For a foodie, it's totally worth the price- but if you're not, maybe eat a large lunch and try just a few plates and have a drink?  No matter which way you go, I highly recommend giving it a try.  Spanish Tapas is such a great way to eat.

Our waitress was amazing, and was extremely helpful in explaining how the menu worked as well as how traditional meals in Spain are enjoyed. We started off with the very confusing drink menu on their i pad- there were so many things listed, we got her advice and let her pick for us.  I had a glass of Cava (spanish sparkling wine) and my partner had two different glasses of spanish reds- all were right on par with what we said we liked. 

We ordered:
Chorizo Palacios-A slightly spicy cured pork sausage seasoned with pimentón and garlic
Sopa de ajo con huevo-Garlic and bread soup with a slow-cooked egg
Chistorra envuelta en patata frita-Slightly spicy chorizo wrapped in crispy potato
Gambas al ajillo-famous tapa of shrimp sautéed with garlic
Codorniz con salsa de romero y alioli de miel-Grilled quail with rosemary sauce
and honey alioli
Salpicón de cangrejo-Jumbo lump crabmeat with cucumbers, peppers, tomatoes, cauliflower and Sherry dressing 

We also had some traditional muscles, and as someone who usually doesn't care for the texture or taste, I could have had only that for my whole meal and died happy! 

On this trip we visited a new place each night- and this was the winner!! a must try :)Stayed at Aria for Thanksgiving. Spoke with the Concierge at the Hotel for a place to have a Formal Dinner with a Good Food and Ambiance. She Called and made a Reservation for 2 at the Twist by Pierre Gagnaire at Mandarin Hotel. Its on the 23rd Floor.

Place has the best Seat in Town. With only 60 Seats. This Place has a very classy Ambiance. The Host ask for our Coat and Seated Us Well. The Servers. All has a VERY VERY Good Knowledge on what they Serve. We got the Six Course Tasting Menu. Plus a very very good bottle of Riesling wine from Germany .Its not the Buffet type of Serving you see. But small serving that by the end of the Meal. You'll be very Full.

Im very pleased while they serve the Plate.They inform you of whats on it. How it was prepared. They all work together. I think i got around 5 + Servers come to our table explaining details on what they serve. 

As what I say. It may be very expensive But with the Experience? Id do it Once a Year. This is a QUALITY Restaurant with QUALITY SERVERS WHO KNOW WHAT THEY DO. From the HOST to Servers to the Managers !! Very Impressed.....

Bill for 2      $400+
Bill for Scharzhof Riesling. Egon Muller (2007)         $210

plus a good tip for the Service ....

Overall, Id Recommend it.....

Mahalo to the Hawaiian Guy who served us. Another Server who was in Maui too. And the French Server who's very pleased with all the Questions we asked...Location is great on the 23rd floor of mandarin oriental hotel.  We arrived a little early and service was fantastic.  Before the meal they bring out some mini appetizers which were fantastic.  We then had 2 foie gras and they arrive as 6 different dishes.  Simply amazing.

I had the Oregon wagyu beef which was cocked to perfection and my wife tried their fish and shrimp plate which also was good.  

For drinks we had Cucumber martinis (awesome), bloody Mary (pretty good).

Dessert was again simply amazing.  Dinner here is expensive even without drinks.

Waiters are very helpful so don't hesitate to ask them any questions.The club was amazing. The floor we stayed played the best house music. We were told that the 5th floor played R&B and the 7th floor more of the pool/lounging area. So far the people that worked in the club were very helpful an they really tried to accommodate everybody. They charged men 120 dollars  for the ticket at the door but they can get 75dollar online. For women only 40dollars. Thank God. But still better if you are on the guest list, then you don't need to worry waiting on the long line and paying for the charge. Taking a cab is the best idea after party.all in all, it was a good experience and will come back here next time.Deal of a prix fixe lunch for $20. I was expecting less than great service with it being lunch & probably less staff, but service was very prompt & courteous. Get the lavraki- little sea bass was delicious. I also got the yogurt martini- a bit tart & refreshing Greek yogurt. My friend's pork chop was good, but she thought her walnut dessert was a little too sweet. The coffee was fine; in order for me to judge a restaurant as good, it must serve good coffee. I'd go back to check out dinner if I ever visit Vegas again.I love Jersey Mike's Subs!  Everything is so fresh here, the meat, bread, and veggies taste great!  I love the Chipotle Philly Sub and the Club Supreme.  I'm not sure what it is that makes Jersey Mike's way better than Subway or Quizno's, but maybe its the fresh cut meat, fresh cut cheese, or fresh bread.  

Check it out!Very pleased with this place.  

We were bummed after the Super Bowl and our loss of money.   Later in the evening after the all you can eat buffet from Rhumbar wore off, we headed here.  About 11:00, place was not that busy.

We ordered a whole pie (more economical that way).  

Good ingredients, crispy crust and PBR on tap!

I won't tell you how to get there.  That is half the fun.We are from New York and we take our pizza very seriously.   I heard about Secret Pizza from a friend before we came out here.    Let me just say it was worth every penny!   My husband is not a crust guy, so I usually eat his.    Not this time.   He ate it all.    We got a large pepperoni and mushroom pie.   Before we left we ate two slices each.    On the way back to MGM we encountered a homeless woman on the walkway between NYNY and the MGM.    We shared our pizza with her.    When something good comes into your life you must pay it forward!Had my daughters 2nd birthday party here today and was impressed with the facility. The staff was friendly, as well as the owner. The place is always clean and the staff was there for all my needs. They did not hawk any of my guests, and were actually playing with some of the children in the ball pit. I was pleased with our service and would recommend this place to others as it was recommended to me. Rates are not really crazy and i had around 60 people (children and adults) in my group. The owner and staff even helped us with all of our stuff personally to our SUV. I though the place was great..Very clean, Vietnamese/fusion restaurant! I've been here multiple times and got something new each time and have not been disappointed!

Appetizers: Summer rolls or spring rolls are always fresh and the peanut sauce that goes with it is amazing as well. the Shrimp Bruschetta are my favorite hands down!

Entrees: I've had all of the following and all of them are delicious.. it's just a matter of what you're in the mood for! It's hard to find this much variety around this area.

-Pho
-Crab Meat Vermicelli (bun rieu)
-Wonton/BBQ egg noodle soup 
-Beef stew (hu tieu bo kho)
-Spicy beef soup (bun bo hue, my favorite soup!)
-Grilled Pork and Shrimp Vermicilli
-Anise Noodle (another favorite!)
-Wok seared noodles

I love this restaurant and find myself coming back all the time! See my pictures added =)All I can say is OMG.  I picked out this restaurant online just because of the Millionaire Deviled Eggs.  Quite frankly that was the thing I like least.  Only because the Thousand Island dressing overpowered the entire thing.  I could taste a little crab but no truffle or caviar.  I would put the Thousand Island around the plate so you could dip in a little or a lot to your taste.

That said, the rest of the food, as well as the wine, was totally delightful.  I had the French Dip with Truffle Tater Tots and the hubby had the Lobster Club with Truffle Tater Tots.  We paired it with their CC: Winery 2008 Cab.  This Cab was terrific and complimented the food well.

The French Dip was Prime Rib and was sweet, tender and delicious-- the bread was perfect, toasted on the bottom and flaky like a croissant and the Swiss cheese just gave it that little something in the background.  

Hubby's Lobster Club was also great--lobster was cooked perfectly.  The bacon was applewood which gave it a great flavor.  

Now to the Truffle Tater Tots--AMAZING--we had to ask how they were made.  The waiter said they were fried in oil with a little truffle oil infusion, then tossed with truffle salt with just a hint of truffle oil drizzle.  I love anything with truffles and these not only didn't disappoint, but I may spend the next year trying to get them right at home.

Our service was fine but we were there on a Tuesday around noon.  Definitely going back.Cosa dire di Vegas...
What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas, Baby!
Questa città è incredibile perché è fintamente bellissima ed ogni volta che si torna si scopre un nuovo pezzettino.I'm astonished by the number of one-star reviews for this place.  I'm wondering if there's some huge confusion...  Two reviews complain about the poor and/or snotty service.  That was not our experience at all.  I dined here twice in Jan 2011, both times at lunch, and the service was without reproach.

Two of the reviews take issue with the quality of the food and/or portion size.  Maybe things have changed by the time of my visits, but that was not my experience at all.  On the first visit,  my S.O. had the pork panini and the  Speck Tirolese; I had the pici: spaghetti w/ braised duck sauce & black truffles.  The portions were definitely not big, but they're not small either.  The portion size is definitely not so small that it should result in such bitter complaints.  Besides, when it comes to food, price, portion, quality, are very relative and should be judged together, not individually.  Expecting Olive Garden price and portion here would be setting one up for a negative Yelp review!

I am also baffled by the "mediocre bread" comment.  Unfortunately, the reviewer in question has only two reviews so I have no clue what caliber of bread he is accustomed to.  I can say, as a baker of French bread for eight years, that D.O.C.G Enoteca's breads are nothing to sneeze at.

This place is definitely in our short list of Vegas casual lunch places.Me and the manfriend came to Scottsdale to visit a friend.  We all came here for Sunday brunch.  Long story short: LOVED IT.   

The casual chic decor was lovely, causal chic with a sophisticated and nautical flair. The drinks were tasty (and strong), after 1 mimosa I was gooooood. And the food: WOW, let's just say I wish The Herb Box would open up out here in Los Angeles!  I ordered the crispy falafel balls as an appetizer and the urban market salad as my entree.  Both were delicious.

Not sure when I'll be going back to Scottsdale, but eating here will be on my to-do list.Kip was great! Super nice guy and does fabulous work! I even got him to tint some windows in my house. Kudos to an excellent tint job on my car!We chose this restaurant based on Yelp reviews and as usual, you people were right. Wait staff was awesome, giant shrimp cocktail was delicious and the cocktail sauce that came with it was the best I've ever had. Amazing ahi tuna main course, along with several delicious chocolate martinis. I know those flavors probably don't compliment each other, but theyre my favorite. My fish was served with wasabi mashed potatos, which everyone tasted and loved and we all managed to steal bites of everyone elses food. No room for desert, outside of those chocolate martinis. Weill, one of our group was going to order another round of oysters for desert, but he decided he just couldn't squeeze them in.Such a great restaurant.  Good food and ambience. For appetizers we had the hummus and the goat cheese.  For dinner the lobster lasagna with a side of spinach.  Everything was superb and the service was great too!  I plan on going back soon.Had dinner with my family and it was excellent. The service was quick and prompt and excellent also. Would dine there again...This was definitely the best meal of this year's holiday trip....

The Kale Caesar! is a very creative interpretation of the timeless classic.  We loved the melted Scamorza cheese.  

I had the Applewood Smoked Duck for my entree, accompanied by a glass of the Siduri pinot from Willamette.  The wine was perfect with the cherry sauce, besides the fact that pinot is a classic pairing with duck.  A glass of Siduri for $12 is a great deal, too.  I loved the way the duck was prepared, too, and it did not weigh me down afterwards like duck often can, either.

My wife had the buttermilk roasted chicken along with a glass of their creative (and delicious) interpretation of sangria.  Roasted Brussels sprouts and sweet corn are part of the presentation.  

Dessert was the decadent Dream Pudding Jar.  We always get excited about an original dessert dish, and this one did not disappoint.

Service was top notch all the way, also.Very impressed all around with the service, ambience and food. Our server was spot on and you can tell this crew is well trained to make your dining experience vey enjoyable.It was amazing! The vegan food was so delicious. The atmosphere and service was fantastic! Will be going back soon.I work for Wells Fargo across the street, and with a limited lunch schedule Jimmy Johns has always came through for me in clutch. I have never spent more than 3mins in the location no matter what time of day I arrived. That is a serious plus.

The subs themselves are hard to mess up, I mean really....If you have something negative to say about a sub from JJ or Subway, just make it yourself...

Thanks Jimmy.Walked into almost every shop. The Forum Shops are awesome, it's the place to be!The food is always top notch and the so are the drinks.  Come to think of it so is the vibe and the service, so I guess that makes it a no brainer.  It has some constants on the menu that are all good and everyday there is a new entree which has always been awesome.  Go check it out, you won't regret it.This is a wonderful coffee shop with a warm, open vibe and a great play area for children.  It is a great spot for lunch as they serve soup and sandwiches as well.  Check it out!You have found the best Dentist office in the greater Phx area. They get you in on a moment's notice and can have work done the same day as your first visit. I have never seen that anywhere else. Every person you meet on staff will treat you with respect and listen to your needs. I am so impressed with this office. They also have incredibly modern equipment and different treatment options depending on your pay scale. 5 out of 5Abuela's Tacos has a simple and delicious menu. Everything is extremely fresh and delicious. I love the asada fries and I make sure to get a meal there at least once a week. Delicious, affordable and the owner is the nicest last that you can meet. A great overall experience.The Arrogant Butcher was one of the best meal experiences I have ever had!  If you are in Phoenix, you must go.  We had the mussels as apps and pretzels - both were amazing(and I am not a pretzel fan). Both the swordfish and rib entree we're great.  My son had the ravioli dumplings. The flavor was good, but it was a lot of very filling food.  The atmosphere is cool and casual, but their commitment to food is serious!The tabouli is amazing, the drinks are awesome, and the salted caramel pudding is super tasty. The meat and cheese plate didn't have much meat and cheese though. ;) Our service was excellent and we would definitely come back again.Their vegetarian offerings are yummy and a lot to choose from - easily made vegan and they were happy to adjust any menu item for me. Tasty. Where else can you get a zucchini flower quesadilla thru a drive thru window?Great location, you can bike right up too it...lawn is awesome and well layed out.  Bathrooms and concessions are right there.I called Pristine to do a move-in clean for my new rental house on tues and they were there yesterday afternoon (weds). There were three girls who were very nice and about an hour later their supervisor appeared. They spent three hours cleaning, never stopped working, and did an amazing job. Very affordable and well worth the money!We went tonight for dinner..this was our first time to any Oregano's.  The service was FANTASTIC and our food (Chicken Alfredo, dinner salad, and a thin crust pizza) was really good.  There was enough food that I didn't need to order a child's dinner for my son (In fact, we had enough leftover for lunch tomorrow).  We were immediately seated.  We chose to sit on the patio (there was plenty of room inside) which was fun but too many flies to make it totally enjoyable.  Next time we will sit inside.  My only negative would be that they put the bread sticks under the pasta of the Chicken Alfredo and that makes them too soggy ( I would serve on top or the side)  and it was a little pricy for casual dinning. Thanks for a great dinner!Great service, great food, amazing ambiance. We had the bruschetta and lobster Mac and cheese. D'lish!What a great little spot! Off the beaten path and "off the hook" as well! 

I had seen some previous reviews on Yelp but hadn't thought to check the place out. My parents were in town today and saw a full-page feature in the New Times on this place, so my dad suggested trying it. By the time we arrived after our delightful yoga class at Urban Yoga (how very Central Phoenix - I know, I know), it was about 1:40 and the place was completely empty. Sometimes, that can result in a less-than-enthusiastic greeting from owners or waitstaff but the man who greeted us was friendly and seemed genuinely happy that we were there. I love that. 

He took our drink order right away. The sodas were a little under-carbonated but no big deal. Easily fixed, for sure. My mom raved about her iced tea, so no complaints there. 

The menu was a little smaller than I expected (the owner later explained that he wanted to start more minimal and then branch out after getting a customer base, which is a good strategy IMO), but several things stood out to me. My dad and I ordered loat chat, worm-shaped rice noodles, but substituted tofu for beef (not immediately obvious that we could do this but we were gracefully accommodated), and the stir-fried shrimp (came with white rice, pickled vegetables and an egg roll). My mom chose the chicken noodle soup and we also got some fresh spring rolls for the table. 

All of the food came out very quickly and was extremely flavorful and robust without being too greasy or salty. The shell-on shrimp were a particular favorite of mine - although they were very messy to eat, they were very tender and had a nice kick to them. The rice noodles were also great and the shredded egg on top was a delicious touch. 

All in all, our meal was great - and affordable, to boot. All of our drinks, entrees and the spring rolls came out to only $34 including tax and tip. The owner was also great and we all loved his passionate approach to his business. He even told us that he opened the place because he was told that a Cambodian restaurant wouldn't survive in this city.  

A rebel after my own heart. And, after all, doesn't Phoenix need more rebels?Food is great. Beautiful atmosphere.  Service is phenomenon and owners are extremely friendly and helpful.Best burger in town.Was in Vegas last month for work, I checked out this spot on a Wed night. Let me just share it was "off the chain!!!" Got there about 12:30 and left about 2:30?? I was with some work friends and we where all stunned by the place. Make sure you are on the list or made a connection to just walk right in to avoid the line and cover charge. The club itself is not that big, but the beauty (the women where gorgeous) of what's inside, more than make up for the size. 

What caught me off guard, was the outdoor patio. It has a great view of Caesars Palace, the Bellagio and you can can look up and down the Las Vegas Blvd at all the lights of the other casinos. The music on the patio was a banging (maybe it was industry night and the DJ was doing his thing) and everyone seemed to be dancing and having a great time, the music on the inside of the club which had a different vibe, was just as good. So no matter where you decided to post up, you where bound to move your body. 

Fellas, make sure "you got your game on point" to talk to any of the ladies there. Ladies, make sure you dress and shoe game is "fly" because the waitresses have on the French Maid outfits  and their bodies and looks will catch any real man's attention. I wish I could tell you how much the drinks cost (all on corporate card), but they where nice and strong!

I am sure there are other nights in which this place is just as hot!!, and I guess on my return, I may find out, but if I am in town on a Wed anytime soon, the Chateau is where I will be...btw, its in the Paris Casino!!I love this yogurt shop! It is always clean and well stocked. The people up front are friendly. I also like that they always have fruit flavors and not just cookies n cream. I think this is the best one in Phoenix.I finally ventured in and let one of the associates explain the options and variations to me. Her name was Reagan, she picked up on my desire for a little variety right away. She showed me the different designs that different sactionals could create in my home so that over time I was able to create a "new" couch in my home without actually replacing it. I loved the idea! We bought the 5 Series with 5 sides and 5 bases. I absolutely love the patience Reagan and the other associates showed when I asked them to re-show me different setups and to clarify the material, durability (I have large dogs and kids) and warranty. The financing process was super fast and delivery only took 2 weeks. The delivery company didn't correspond with us as much as Love Sac employees did but emails ended up being sufficient with delivery dates. I even received a follow up call from Reagan, making sure my set up was complete, smooth and I didn't have any questions and to see if we were happy with our end result. The answer is yes!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Kelly has been doing my hair for over 2 years. She is an expert, and so much fun to talk to. It's obvious that her goal is to make her clients look and feel their best. She is very detailed, and she uses high-quality products to yield the best result. I love the suite-style salon she works in too. 
Kelly gives personalized, individual service to all her clients. If you're looking for a new salon, call Kelly and make an appointment right away.Great for lunch, quick service and reasonable prices.Great place for drinks and good food! Month of May they are having KIRIN PITCHER SPECIAL for only 10.00 BUCKS! 5pm-7pm/ 11pm-2am.My daughter has attended CCPK for the past two years.  We love this school!  It's a great Christian environment with excellent teachers.  It has been obvious to me since my daughter started attending CCPK that the teachers truly love the kids.  I (being slightly neurotic about leaving my child) feel very safe leaving her every day, and she loves to go!

She has learned so much in the two years she's been there - I couldn't be more pleased with our experience at this school.  It's wonderful!The fish and chips as well as the Shepard Pie were excellent.  All the servers are excellent,  with a smattering of Irish accents across several of them.  Great beer selection and a good kids menu.  We were there twice on our recent visit to Vegas,  and joined their rewards program.  We'll be back.  Love the beer sampler.I've been here a few times since they opened (i live next door), and have always had amazing food, drink and service....untill (Que Law and Order Theme Music here) last Sunday night. When Alissa (the manager) is there, its a well run machine. Greeted politely, seated immediately, waited on perfectly. Sunday was the first time we went in, and she wasn't there (the on duty front desk mgr ((get to that shortly)) said she had worked the past 10 days in a row and deserved a night off; no question!). We were seated immediately on the wonderful patio, between the water fall and the fire pit. ordered drinks and apps, all came out fast and amazing as always. However, after an hour and 10 minutes of waiting for our main dishes we were beyond livid at our Stoned Out waiter. he seriously must have been in the back playing guitar and yanking on his curly white boy hair. we never saw him and when we did he continued to make excuse after excuse. At one point, he said they were plating our food....43 minutes later we saw him again. Then he blamed "the 14 top that was just seated"...um really? they were eating when we walked in; and they were THE ONLY ones in the entire place!!! When we Finlay broke down, and asked for a mgr, he immediately came over (Chris i believe) and asked what was going on. 2 minutes into the conversation, he said "stop, let me get this handled" and went to get it handled. our food arrived, along with out POS waiter who didn't say a single word. he just sat our food down, and left, never to be seen again. Chris came back over, and told us our entire meal was comped (all martinis, sodas, apps, entrees', everything!). I understand bad seeds. The only reason I'm still at a 5 star is because of the management, the normal service, and the food is beyond tasty. But, be warned of 2 things: you will pay a premium for the quality (worth every penny to me as long as hippie isn't your Waiter) and 2, if a white boy with curly hair and Cashed eyes is your Waiter, move seats out of his section. If i see him when i go back, my review will drop to 4 stars. Alissa, please smack him around a bit.Very delicious food. Their lunch specials are awesome! You get a good amount of food.Effing HILARIOUS!!!! Totally raunchy and did I mention HILARIOUS!! Need I say more??I LOVED it, I seriously think it is the best show I have seen in Vegas, however it is not for everybody.

The show is REALLY raunchy, and could be uncomfortable for certain people I am sure. The ringmaster makes fun of people in the audience (racial, sexual orientation, etc.) and we saw some people leaving because it was so out there, but if you are not offended by that kind of humor then you are probably fine.

It is a fairly small venue and I will say you are uncomfortably close to the people next to you and the seats are just uncomfy on their own, but still totally worth it, imo.

The acrobatic acts, were all just awesome. Very talented people and some things I had never seen before. Plus you are very close so that adds some excitement. 

Penny was adorable and HYSTERICAL, with her totally inappropriate sexual stories and her back and forth with the Ringmaster, she was my favorite by far. We were still talking about her days later, her character in that show is just perfect.

All in all, I thought it was a fabulous show, and tons of fun :-)wow.   all you can eat or not, this is outstandingly good sushi.   great chefs.   fredo is the man.   almost makes me want to come back to vegas (almost!)   win.Just in....OPEN DURING LUNCH for AYCE NOW!!!!! I can now happily go into food coma for the rest of my afternoon work day!  

Good quality fish for an AYCE and they don't pack the nigiri with big blocks of rice....but no sashimi available here.  I honestly don't know much about the rolls...since I tend to be a pure fish lover....versus the cream cheese/avocado/mayo/etc mixed into the rolls. My favorite nigiri is the salmon belly, white tuna, unagi, and toro...don't forget to check out the blackboard near the cash register...it has the specials for the day!

Similar menu to Sushi Mon off Maryland Pkwy...with the exception of special dishes like the spicy tuna rice cracker and the seared pork belly....I literally will eat 2-3 orders on my own to the disgust of those around me...but I think buffets should definitely be a no judgment zone .....I will gladly admit I wear my "elastic band pants" for all you can eats...don't want any buttons holding me back =)

Dessert is awesome with selections of tofu cheesecake, green tea creme brulee, green tea cake, red bean/green tea ice cream, mochi ice cream.

Only minor complaint...some items have been "unavailable"...specifically  the lychee sorbet and the yellow tail collar which is succulent morsels of fish with ponzu suace, A MUST TRY that is if they have it....so maybe leaning towards a 4 star rating compared to the first time I went there....due to some missing items.Tracy B made the awkward process of bikini waxing as easy and pain free as possible. She is quick and thorough! The studio is very professional, clean and pretty!I went to dinner last night for my birthday with my husband, son and granddaughter. I wanted to try something different so we went to Wine 5 Cafe on Tenaya & Cheyenne. I had the Nairobi Pork Chops with Red Onion and Royco Gravy. DELICIOUS!! I even ate the cooked spinach. I have never liked cooked spinach!! The portions are good size. For my birthday, they served a complimentary strawberry shortcake dessert and sang Happy Birthday in Swahili! It was beautiful. I will be eating there again. Next time, I hope my mom and brothers will be able to join us!Hot sauce is amazing. The cashiers have always been nice and the food is great. I've been to a few of their other locations and while the food is consistently good between locations, the service here is excellent. It's also really clean, which I think everyone appreciates! They seem to be cleaning every time I come by....Homemade, local, honest ice cream. This place is super cute, and the staff is always very friendly.

There is an assortment of older style candy, brining in a nice retro-vintage-esque to your visit. The ice cream is always superb, as is their award winning salted caramel topping. (Rich, thick drizzle...need I say more?!)

There is limited parking, but plenty nearby. I think we can all handle walking a block for ice cream ;).. And if not, have someone run in and grab it! There is no indoor seating, just outside in front and in back.

If you appreciate local charm and are looking for some great ice cream, shakes, malts or cookies, make a pit stop at Churn.

P.s. Butter Pecan & salted caramel topping is one of my favs!I've never heard of this place until a week ago. I'm from California and was visiting some friends in Mesa, and they suggested that I try this place out. The next day I went there and ordered breakfast burritos for everyone. Let me start by saying that I wish there were places like this in California with the drive thru etc. The food was prepared fast considering what I ordered. The prices were cheaper than I'm used to paying for in Cali. Most importantly the breakfast burritos were huge and delicious! I especially like how they don't just stuff a huge amount of hash browns or potatoes in the burrito like they do over here. Open some more locations in California (Los Angeles area)!This place is as good as it gets in Tempe, and I have lived here 20+ years. The owners are always very friendly, and they are eager to share to share their vision for their shop. OSP does not just have the best coffee in Tempe; they also the best barista in the state (Take my word for it, Gianni is the best). Prior to going to OSP for my iced americano every day, I had been going to Cartel Coffee Lab for a number of years. I have to say that I like OSP much better as I get a great drink without having to wait 20 minutes in line. 
I will definitely be a regular from now on!There's nothing like a fat burrito on a Saturday morning!!

I love a good burrito when I'm hungover, and I don't like to walk into a crowded shop and wait 20 min for it. This BE is small and fast. They have tables outside, and they are hooked onto a gas station which is majorly convenient. 

They also have a pretty good size delivery area, AND no delivery charge... love it. Get the green salsa, its mild but awesome.

I haven't tried a burrito from here that I didn't like; the only downfall is that they are closed Sundays, and weekends are my chill food days.Abridged: 
Coworking (drop in + packages), event venue, meeting space, awesome.

Really? No one's reviewed Co+Hoots yet? 

Co+Hoots is a great space in an old building on 7th Street near Roosevelt. It's a place for small businesses, the self-employed and anyone else interested to have a space to work that's not their house. It allows for brainstorming, socializing and bouncing ideas off others. There are both rates for drop in one time visits and for packages for full-time inhabitants. 

The work environment is an open collaborative space with meeting rooms to use when needed.

I've been there several times for both professional organization meetings and social events and every time I find it hard to leave. There's such a welcoming vibe and the creativity that abounds in that place is astounding. 

If you need a place to work for a day to get out of your element, a place to call home for your business of 1, a spot to hold a meeting or a swanky sexy space to hold an after hours gallery or social event, this is your place.

Still not convinced? Swing by and check it out. I'm sure they won't mind!!I am extremely picky when it comes to dental service and after going through a half a dozen dentists in my short time in Las Vegas, I was in search of yet another.

I came across one of those valpak flyers with Stonewater Dentistry  and decided to give them a try. Sooo glad I did! Dr. Sharika Patel is amazing, professional, and friendly. This office has some the most high tech equipment I have ever experienced and virtually pain free. I found the hygienist to be great as well and the consultation afterwards. 

I have refereed some of my coworkers and they were also impressed and thankful for the recommendation. 

The office has an exclusive feel to it. And yes I am going to say it...I am looking forward to my next visit!Best dentist and office in Vegas! After going through quite a few dentists after my move to Vegas I am so happy I came across this office! The staff and dentist are so friendly and genuine! I highly highly recommend this office to anyone looking for a true dentist and not someone looking to just make money from insurance companies.Fantastic!  Showed up with no prior call and had a great set of flowers in less than ten minutes at a reasonable price.  This is your place!Personally, it's the best Indian food I have ever experienced. My friend, whom I dined with lived in London when she was younger and enjoyed a lot of fantastic Indian food while she was there. She also quite enjoyed it. We had veggie samosa, and chile naan with chicken Tikka marsala. 

The staff was really accommodating and were very helpful. I will say that we ordered medium heat and it was almost too hot at times. We agreed to level 5 heat, loved it but will probably go with 4 or 3 next time...lol. Anyhow, we will be back for the lunch buffet.Every time I go to Nubius Hookah Lounge and Smoke Shop, I always order from them.
They cater to you! And I'm only next door!!
I either stop by and order before I go next door to hang out with my friends, or call them when I'm there.
They have it done in a good amount of time.
And their stuff is fresh. Very delicious.
I love their Hot wings, their rice soup, greek FRIES, their calzones. I mean every there is yummy.
I love this place.Great food, try the burger with carmelized onion and roasted garlicI haven't been here in awhile. Unfortunately for me my bra size is so expensive I wear my bras for longer than I should. I know, I know. Shame on me, but I'm a poor college student. This place is the only place I've been able to find my cup size in though! You may scoff, but as a 34HH it's no easy task to find an in person store who carries my size. I almost jumped around in joy when I discovered that! This place gives a great fit. They definitely know what they're doing, unlike the terrible, terrible staff at Victoria's Secret. I have no idea who I worked with, but I know it was one of the owner's. She was a peach! She was just so helpful! She even gave me a few sites I didn't know about where I can find my sized bras. I found it shocking that she was more than happy to hand over other places to find my bras. Maybe she felt my pain in finding the right size. Either way, when I get a chance I'll be back in. Oh, and the prices were pretty competitive with the sites I've had experience with.Order the spice at 8 or 9, it's perfect. If you order the spicy chicken salad it is important to ask for it extra hot. Excellent food.I tried a lot of Thai places around Vegas, Pan Asian is in the top 3.

We ordered takeout for pineapple fried rice and pad see-ew... very good!For a moral lunch, I got the office a half dozen cupcakes and half dozen cookies. 

The red velvet cupcake and cookies are AMAZING!!! 

The salted caramel is delicious too! I didn't get to try the others, but the plates were empty in the matter of minutes (and this office doesn't care for sweets, so that says a LOT). 

Totally recommend their deserts here.From the outside it seems like sort of an inner-city type store but once you get in everyone's really friendly and helpful. They always have exactly what you need and the prices seem reasonable. They have everything from reasonably priced booze to upscale liquors and I really like the place it's my go to liquor store.Can't wait to try more from their menu!  I needed appetizers for a gathering after work.  I ordered the Four Dip Combo:  Tzaziki; Hummus; Lebni; and Melizanosalata.  The Melizanosalata with roasted eggplant, garlic, olive oil, and lemon juice was my favorite! But all four were super delicious!  It came with warm, yummy pita bread.  They were a big hit!  Just because I can't pass up on dessert, I also got the baklava.  OMG - it was perfect, not too sweet, just perfection!  I arrived right around 5 pm, just before a huge rush!  :-)  Will be back for a full meal!Great traditional Chinese food! Beef chow main is awesome. Pork dim sum very good. Peking style pork was great too. A little out of the center of town if you are a tourist. But food is well worth it.Bruce is awsome!  When I had a blue screen (yes blue:-( ) . One call & Bruce was on the case.  He backed up my memory & then he did what he needed to get me up & running again.  Nothing lost on my computer!  
I also used him to unlock my computer from a program.  He did this online from his home and I was at mine. :) 10 minutes and fixed! 
I highly recommend Computer Troubleshooters for all your computer needs.Hey, it's been a few visits since my update. 

I can tell you that Christine has continued to outperform expectations, and others I've sent her way have confirmed it by becoming regulars themselves.

One appreciated feature: Art of Touch is entirely cyber-inter-connected. So you can make appointments via email (you are sent a Google calendar invite to confirm when you set it up) and get your receipts that way, as well. 

Thumbs up.I stopped by a Friday morning a few months past and have been meaning to write a review. I've had donuts since then from other donut shops, but none compare to Bosa. The price and quality at Bosa are far superior to all others. You can't go wrong with the donut holes.I'm giving this place 5 stars and I'll tell you why...

Came here for a wash, whilst in the wash the machine broke my mirror off!! Royally pissed (but also found it hilarious?) I approached an employee who retrieved my mirror. However, the wash ripped some wiring out along with my mirror. 

Long story short, the manager got in contact with me and fixed my car. Even went as far to take a fuse out of his own truck to fix my issue, all within a timely manner. 

These dudes rule. I'd just be careful of how violent that car wash can be. Kind of terrifying. But if you're into that kinda thing... 

The customer service was so great, I'll be back... But a little more careful next time.Great Burgers.
Great Appetizers.
Great beers.
Fast Service.

It's the perfect combination for a bar.   They also open some exclusive beers on occasion.  Recently had Dog Fish Head 120 Min IPA.   It's a great combination, I've been here for lunch, and for dinner, and all of the above were true.   Most of the times I've noticed the same bar tender, and give props to the guy.  He runs a good ship, and kept our drinks at the ready, and food handy when we sat at the bar.

Often at lunch they have the Burger with Guac and bacon on the menu.   Not something I'd normally order.  On an adventurous day I ordered it.... and am now in a rut because that's all I want to order.SO GOOD! my husband loves diners, drive in's and dives and when we saw this place reviewed and realized it's five minutes from where we live, we decided to go there today for lunch. I'm not a super adventurous eater, but this was AMAZING!
Awesome service.......our servers were attentive, helpful and helped us order! 
We will FOR SURE be back!I am a crepe fan!! And I am happy to say I have found a new breakfast favorite...you had me at cucumber water and passion fruit mimosa...but the crepes were fantastic! I even broke my rule and ate some of my BF's crepe that had chorizo and it was sublime!! If you have a vegetarian option for that crepe, I will officially camp outside your door until you open every morning!!  Thank you for the fantastic service and the amazing food! We will be back soon to try out more stuff on your menu!My daughter had her first class and loved loved loved it.  We were looking for a judo school and found BCF. Not knowing what to expect when she attended, and found herself with training with two black belts plus the owner. 
They took their time and really helped her feel comfortable, and shared their many years of expertise. 
They welcomed her with open arms and we're encouraging to keep coming back. The owners of BCF were more then helpful. Policies are clear and up front with nothing to hide .. No contracts , sign up fees or maintenance fee. She has had 7years of training in TKD, and will now enjoy several years of training at BCF !! 
If you are in search of a school that will provide excellent training...look no further..
You just found it !I had the most wonderful experience here today.  The salon was clean without the harsh chemical smells wafting around. 

Heather was spectacular.  She explained my options, was extremely personable and pleasant.  

This will definitely be the place I go for my hair from now on.really really good! come visit if in vegas 2nd best cajun style seafood place ive been hard to get find a taxi back to the strip though but the food was worth it and the staff there are attentive the wait was not too bad also id def come backLove this place!  I don't know how they cook their meat, but the shredded beef is to die for.  So tender.  I love the chips and salsa and can't stop at 1 bowl.  Adorable patio.  Great service!  We placed a large order for tamales during the holidays and were not disappointed.This place was, without a doubt, the highlight of my family's trip to Vegas.

You get to drive a bulldozer or backhoe for about 90 minutes, with a quick training session in their office and coaching over radio while you're in your mechanical beast. 

The whole thing feels safe, fun, and it's just a blast.

Cannot recommend this enough.Finally knocked that off the bucket list. Had one of the greatest experiences in Vegas. I ran the dozer but will be back some day for the excavator. Can't wait.We bought a groupon here last week and used it that night.  The prices were great and the staff was super friendly.  The sushi was phenomenal!  We ordered the Pink Lady and I could have eaten 6 of them!Went for happy hour and was impressed with the sushi and to top it off all the rolls were half off. Big plus! Friendly staff as well.After landing from a long flight, my husband and I wanted something casual, quick and delicious. ..this was it!! Found it through yelp and so glad we did. It's family owned and they were super friendly.  We had brisket, creamed corn and mac'n'cheese. Highly recommended!Angel has been taking pictures at various times over the last year of my dogs. I have had different photographers take pictures over the years and Angel's pictures of been the best. The last set of pictures she took at a park are my favorite pictures taken by anyone. She has gotten my fur babies personalities  and has great patience. We are already planning pictures for the fall. He prices are very reasonable and I have been getting tins with pictures on them to go with the theme of the pictures which is part of the price. 
I highly recommend Emotions of Light. You won't be disappointed.I can't rave about CHAKRA 4 enough. I can't believe I had to stumble upon this place to find it! If you're a vegan, vegetarian, yogi, health nut, tea-lover, or just like great veg food and drinks, this place is for you. I got the Chaga tea (chai, Chaga, agave nectar, milk)...YUM.

Overall, if you're in need of a post-yoga tea, or just want a healthy pick-me-up, head to Chakra 4.Vinnie has been my regular barber now for 6 months. I have searched high and low for years for someone that can provide a good traditional shave and haircut. It's truly a high end experience that every man should partake.  If your a man and still going to unisex salon's to get your hair "styled"... well I am just saying!We had our wedding cake from here. It was perfect! Everyone loved the pink champagne flavor, which PJ won culinary festival last year.  We had a beautiful 4 tier and they coordinate with the venue and it was flawless. Would highly recommend and the cake was talked about as one of the best wedding cakes ever!Did it meet my expectations..? No.
Am I satisfied..? 100%

I went in for the Brazilian and keep in mind that this was my first time getting waxed.. ever! 

WHAT I EXPECTED
1. I expected to walk in to your typical spacey well lit salon to be greeted by a super cute (possibly intimidating) overly preppy girl.
2. I expected to wait a bit since I showed up 25 minutes early after reading about their policy.. and I'm never early nor ever on time to anything lol.
3. I expected the esthetician to basically "baby" me during the process considering it was my first time. Explaining this explaining that, step by step etc.

WHAT I RECIEVED
1. From the outside, for a brief moment I thought it looked closed. Once I was inside it was dim and totally yoga-lounge like. I was immediately more at ease. The girl behind the desk was just your everyday sweet girl (just trying to pay for college). No overly preppy intimidating fake. There was a light scent in the lobby, not too strong. Very modern. There were things were around to keep you occupied while waiting so you didn't have to stare down other clients. Also saw there was a cute little water dispenser for clients on the corner ledge.
2. I took my sweet time filling out and reading the two pages I was given. Just a moment after I handed to the receptionist I was called back! (Yessss!! This is a good sign! They must like me! They must not be too busy! They won't have to rush!)
3. Beth was my esthetician, she didn't "baby" me as I had hoped but I'm sure glad she didn't. Now I realize, that might have made it worse! She was basically to the point. Do this, do that. During the process we had endless conversations about anything except for what was going on (me laying totally naked waist down in a butterfly position o_o). She was extremely funny to me and it was natural, she wasn't just trying ease my nerves. My friend in the lobby said she even heard us at one point (we were in the first room). When I came out, the first thing I had to say to the receptionist was "I like her, she's funny!".

I'm not sure if they use a new style of wax but there weren't any strips to be pulled off, just the wax that turned hard after a few seconds. 

When I walked out with my friend at the end, she said "see that wasn't as bad as you thought right.. just a little sting for a bit now". 
My response.. "What? It's not stinging at all! I feel completely fine like nothing happened".
Then we walked two blocks right after to surrounding shopping centers looking for a place to sit and chat.. and yes, a couple hours later I still didn't feel any stinging or pain. 

For you ladies that are getting your Brazilian wax for the first time.. I'll answer this for you as I was looking for this answer myself:

I felt sick to my stomach the second I was heading there.. 

Just do it! You're going to start eventually, why not now and why not here?
I took a couple Advil's before I went in and during the process my pain was on average of a 5/6 out of 10, at one point 3 out of 10 and another 7 out of 10. THAT'S NOT BAD considering I was expecting 20 out of 10 lol. It wasn't the worse pain I have ever felt. GO TO BETH! Just go, seriously. YOLO!

I guess you can say my expectations were totallllly off!Awesome.  Larry, Christina and Lucas are wonderful. Tuesday for wine, the best! My goodness the pizza was so yummy. Thank you for being so close to Ahwatukee. Live it!Love it! Not stingy with the meat n cheap! Can't beat it :)We had spicy pork tacos , really good the sauce was simply amazing, very authentic!!! It is a mustThis isn't my first time here at Tacos El Gordo and it definitely isn't my last.

This one in particular, is at the end of the strip, near circus circus and encore. I love Tacos El Gordo and I personally have not had any tacos better than this place. 

The special here is the Adobada (spicy pork) tacos. The server cuts the meat from a rotating pig that makes you just want to drool when looking at it. The tacos are constructed so quickly and I have been to vegas many times to notice the same exact server!

I also always order the Large Adobada Fries which can feed around 5 people. It is a whirlwind of flavor with a special green "crack" sauce that is so unbelievably good I cannot describe it any other way.

The tacos are about $2 each with the large fries being $10. For vegas, this is great, cheap food. I would order 3-4 tacos and split the fries with friends.This place is absolutely delicious!!! I loved the Stetson salad - couscous, roma tomatoes, corn, arugula, smoked salmon, cheese, black currant topped with a basal pesto dressing. Their gnocchi was delicious as well! But what I absolutely enjoyed with their SERVICE!! It was a 10 star service that exceed above and beyond the expectations of even the restaurant each self. Our server even offered to switch out any plates we didn't like since it was our first time there. Their decor was a very warm dining room kind of feeling - dim lights, dark cherrywood tables and chairs. I'ld go back just to be treated like a princess!I called my Home Warranty company (AHS) this morning because my A/C was hesitating to start up and I saw the thermostat start to rise. Before it got any worse, I knew I needed someone to fix it! Luckily, the warrantee company contracts with Grand Canyon Refrigeration!! Martin called me within an hour after my call to AHS. He happened to be in my neighborhood on other jobs so he fit me into his schedule. He came out only 2 hours after my initial call!! On a Holiday!! (4th of July). He was very friendly, pleasant, and professional. He wasnt like the other companies that I've had out here to fix my A/C over the years (other guys have been jerky salesmen and pretended to know about what they were doing). Martin not only fixed my issue, he found that prior repairmen had put unnecessary parts onto my a/c unit!  I would trust him to fix my a/c if anything happened again. Highly recommend!We have a new home and our home warranty was expiring soon. Kevin came out on a Saturday and was very fast and payed attention to detail. There was no major concerns but he pointed out numerous defects that could of cost us money and problems in the future. He sat down with us at the end and went over the inspection report and what to point out to the home builders and why. We highly recommend him for any of your inspection needs!!This is the closest my husband and I have come to NYC pizza in Vegas. The crust was thin enough, but next time we may as them to make it "well done"...we like it crispier.   Great tasting sauce. Good amount of cheese and toppings.  The only thing is that, I prefer loose sausage pieces over the sliceable sausage meat.

Seems like a family owned place. The staff was very nice.  The decor is tasteful...way more inviting than other pizza joints. I like that each table has its own TV.   They don't serve alcohol.

Coming back for sure...I do NOT like popcorn. I really don't. Not at the movies. Not really ever. 

I tried a sample at the Nerdy Yelp event - awesome. One day for lunch I decided to take a trip to the store. You can smell the goodness from the street!

I can't remember exactly what I ordered. I got a bag mixed with 2 different flavors one of which was the Marilyn Monroe and another with white chocolate and raspberry. My combination was really tasty. The Marilyn didn't have the pop rocks that day, which was a bummer, but it was still great.

Yes, it's pricey, but totally worth the indulgence. 

I still don't like popcorn much, but I adore popped.Great dumplings much cheaper and less pretentious than the hipster place across town.Sumita Beauty took my threading virginity a couple months back during a yelp event.. I am so glad I went. I have been a religious waxer and always thought threading would be too painful. While it isn't the most comfortable experience the end results are so worth it! I've never had such a perfect brow arch! The staff are very friendly, I first got my brows done with Daisy who is such a fun bubbly person but have been regularly seen by Glenn who does a great job. The prices are very reasonable and the salon is very clean.My Girlfriend and I decided to venture out for some Mexican after spending a long day in the yard. Something about tacos, horchata, and piles of rice and beans just sounded right, you know? I was perusing yelp for something new and came across this joint - and man was that an awesome find. Seriously, guys. This place is great. I ordered the Carne Asada with Plantains and my Girlfriend ordered 2 chicken tacos. 
The carne asada was flavorful and delicious, the rice and beans tasted fresh and actually had flavor (what!?), and the salad it came with had a ton of avocado and a tasty lime vinaigrette. Then there were the plantains. Normally when you get a side of plantains you get a little lump of them on the side of your plate...not here. I was given two WHOLE plantains that were sliced in half and fried perfectly. They took up half of the plate and they were delicious. As for the tacos, they looked good, they were gigantic, and I was told they tasted very fresh. Also, the horchata was giant sized and delicious. I saved half to drink the next day. Anyway, this place rocked and is currently the only Mexican in town that can compete with Taqueria Guadalajara. Good stuff, man.This place is worth the drive and risk of a sketchy area.  A hidden gem in vegas.  Im not sure they realize how successful they would be on a nicer side of town.  My wife said she likes this place better than her seven hills location, even though I had to beg her to get out of the car at first.  Very clean place, quiet and no pushy emoloyees.  They are amazing in everyway I could think of.Very neat place to go! Very trendy and classy. The food was good and there were a lot of options. My favorite thing is the hidden door in the wall. I had the spicy shrimp and another roll that was good too. We ate here today for a group lunch and had a blast. I would come back for sure. Our waitress was very nice and so was the hostess. *note* they only do group checks so we had to figure out how to split everything.I was visiting the Phoenix area to see my brother and watch a Sharks/Coyotes game. While I was here, I also wanted to find a Krav Maga school so that I can train even when out of the bay area. I found East Valley Krav Maga through the Krav Alliance as a possible place to work out. Two weeks before arriving, I had sent an e-mail to the school explaining that I would be in the area and wanted to know what I had to do to be able to train there while visiting. I received a response the next day from Derrick saying "Come on in 10 minutes before class to fill out the waiver. That's all you need to do."

When we got there, we were greeted by Derrick and the young woman at the front desk. Regretfully, I didn't get her name but she was very nice. We filled out the paperwork while waiting for the children's class to finish up. During that time, we talk to Derrick about the school, how long has it been there, number of students, types of classes, etc. He was very open with answering any questions we had.

After the children's class, we met the other instructor, Charlie. It was amazing to watch this guy teach these kids Krav... He was extremely patient. From what I saw, it looked like he was herding cats but he managed to keep the class in complete control... very cool.

After stretching out, the class started with some warm ups... sit ups, push ups, running, shadow boxing. This went on for about a half an hour. After, it was the defense for a choke from the front. First breaking down the moves then putting it all together and changing partners several times to have a good chance to work. All the students I worked with very friendly and welcoming. We ended the class with a multiple attacker drill.

All in all, I found this to be a great school with good, friendly and knowledgeable teachers and would recommend this place to ANYONE who wants to learn to defend themselves. As we were leaving, we were told that we were welcome to train there anytime we are in the area...I plan on taking them up on it. I also plan on telling all the people at my home school in Union City about this place.This is the best burger I've had for under $10.

I think In N Out is one of the most overrated things in life.  I don't get it!  My wife loves it and could eat there twice a week no problem and I've had my fair share of bites.  I just don't see what the hype is about.  No doubt the price is better along with their fries but I'm not coming here for that.

In my world, a great burger always has a ton of toppings and ordering your burger "all the way" is the only way to go.  These patties are super juicy and taste fantastic.  I also love the melty, oozy greatness of the cheese is put in between the 2 patties.  

On a side note, the soda fountain machine is tremendous.  It's truly straight out of a Jetsons (automatically dating myself bigtime!) episode.  I've never had that many choices for beverages at a burger joint with quite a few flavors I've never seen like raspberry diet coke.  

Now I have 2 unhealthy vices that I might have to indulge in once a month.  This and Nothing Bundt Cakes!Outstanding room and the friendly staff a traveler could ask for! The room was awesome with it's flat screen TV and refrigerator and cool walk in shower. I ended up winning $1030.00 on a slot machine. I went on this trip to Phoenix and out west to see Tombstone, Sedona & Lost Dutchman State park & several ghost towns.
I am retired police officer and like to investigate paranormal & ghost activities.
I was able to photograph a ghost in my room. My ac was not working and I called front desk and they sent maintenance to my room. They quickly fixed the ac and I showed them picture of the ghost and they were shocked. They are unable to rent the room across my my room due to some unknown problem that they told me they were unable to take care of.........?  The room was comped which was a bonus.
Besides the ghost moving things around at night while i slept and turned my computer on I would highly recommend this hotel!Wow! These guys rock! Had what I consider to be a major repipe issue w/ previous sprinkler valves, saw the great reviews, and thought I'd try them out, I did discover they are licensed, bonded and insured, important to know. Called Eldon, sent him a pic from my phone, he said " no problem " amazed me with his confidence, came out a few days later after scheduling w/ Melanie who was very kind and helpful too! Great people to work with on all levels! So I get home, check out Eldon's work, and I was very impressed! Not only did he redo the plumbing neatly and orderly including new valves and solenoids, he also replaced the landscaping rocks and dirt to better than original condition!! He was a joy to work with, and if you want the work done correctly and on time, THIS is the company for you! Look no further!I celebrated my birthday in Vegas. Now that I am 21, I am able to roam freely without being denied entry to a casino ground or anywhere else. I stayed with my sister who recommended this place to me. Let me get going on the review!

As I walked into the shop location, I came across this extremely strong scent of chemicals; It is located in the back of the salon. I was a bit iffy. I thought the scent would have affected the shop's food. I stepped up to the counter and was greeted by young lady name Jenny. She told me the history of why she and the chef, Sheridan opened the place. Ask them yourselves. They won't bite (you). Haha.

Food I ordered:
Roasted Duck Bao - This bao wasn't as messy as I thought it would be. I thought it'd be a typical chinese restaurant bao. Their bao's at warm and fluffy.
Pork Belly Bao (2) - Unbelievable! I've never had such a crispy pork belly bao before! The pork belly is thinly sliced and cooked to a crispy perfection. Each bite I took was more delicious; I would be able to taste each ingredient.
Green Smoothie - Absolutely delicious and refreshing. I highly recommend this even though it costs a couple bucks more. Sure you're grown up enough to eat your vegetables but the way they made the smoothie will absolutely have you wanting more.

This is a good stop for someone that wants to enjoy their food; It does take a bit of time to get your food but good for takes time.I LOVE the bao here! For $10 you can basically get yourself a sampler platter. I come here everytime I'm in Vegas now and it's something that I crave when I'm at home.

Yes, the location is kinda off-putting, but once you have a bite of the bao you'll be hooked! I can barely wait until I get into the car to start munching away!The Pool Steward is an outstanding pool company. They stand by their word for what day they will service your pool, what is done during the service, and with the pricing. I can count on them to show up and provide wonderful pool care for my HOA pool. It took awhile for the HOA Board to switch pool companies, but once we did, the entire community noticed a difference in the pool and how clean it was every week. Thank you to the Pool Steward for your trustworthy service you provide.Sooo yummy!!!!

As a self proclaimed cupcake connoisseur, I was stoked to learn about PYP thru a mutual friend, and was lucky enough to be in town to attend their launch event at the Griffin. 

Um, bomb to the nom-nom anyone? Seriously, the strawberry champagne tasted as good as it sounds, and the grape soda had a little kick to it. It was like eating a grape flavored sweet tart. I can't wait to hit up Vegas again and try more flavors. I will be definitely ordering these goodies for my sister's upcoming bachelorette party. Now only if they can figure out a way to Fed Ex the goods to me in SF we'll be gravy for life!

The cupcakes are gorgeous and the gals are too! Poison never tasted sooo good!I went in there just to see and walked out with 5 personalized fragrances!!! She really knows her blends!! Thank you for all your help and patientsWhen looking for a restaurant there are three things that make me want to come back more than once. First, it has to be food that we cannot easily make at home. Second, the quality of product has to be exceptional. Last, it has to be reasonably priced for what you get.
So far to date there is only one restaurant in the Las Vegas valley that exceeds all of my three criteria; it's called Café De Japon. It seems that I am not the only one that feels this way.
I first heard about them in the Las Vegas weekly. The restaurant is clean and open. With minimal seating they can probably seat 90 people if they squeeze everyone in. It is warm and inviting. The chef who is also the owner greats you when you first walk in from behind the counter, he takes the time to learn your name. One of the three staff that they have will seat you either at a table or at one of the counter seats. At the counter you can watch the chef prepare the cold dishes, like sushi or Carpaccio. 
The owner only brings in the best of ingredients. The restaurant has a regular menu but the specials are what you should come to this place for. They have a big white board with all kinds of words written on it, a lot of them you will not recognize. I had to ask the chef a few times how to pronounce and describe what goes into the special dishes. With these specials he brings in fish from other countries and states. Fish that we cannot easily obtain at home in our local grocery store. That meets my first criteria of a restaurant that I'd like to return to.
 The chef will not serve any of this fish unless he would eat it himself. The freshest vegetables are used. The quality of meat is superior to anything that I could buy in the super market. They also have a variety of drinks like a yuzu soda. I have never had this drink anywhere else in my life and would not even know where to begin to look for it anywhere else. It's made from a fruit called a yuzu fruit. It is so exotic that it is only found in remote parts of East Asia.
While many reviews online say that the restaurant is overpriced, I think the cost is worth it. I leave full and every time I feel like I've had one of the best meals of my life for under eighty dollars. I know it seems that eighty dollars is a lot of money for two people to eat, but the different flavors and textures that you get to have is worth it. The quality is great, the price is reasonable and the food is good quality. It meets all my criteria for returning to a restaurant, over and over.Great subs!I love how it's ice cream weather in Phoenix when it's hot chocolate weather almost everywhere else!

Walked by since my hotel was nearby and it looked cute, but since I had just had lunch the first time, I decided to come back after dinner for dessert.  Wow, they really are in limited quantities!  Once it's gone for the day, it's gone!

Thank goodness there was still one of the "Nuez" in stock... the roasted pecan one is the one I had my heart set on earlier in the day and was the clerk's recommendation for a newbie.

Totally met my expectations!  So worth the $2.75 plus tax for a nice fancy Popsicle!I spilled sauce all over my yellow dress and brand new cream-colored lined coat and am still giving this place four stars:-)
I'm a sucker for some vintage rat-pack, Italian-50s ish themed decor and yummy food.  Everything here is served family style while you listen to the vintage tunes linger in the air and garlic waft about your nose.  
Pazookie.  That word alone is enough to get you there, right?  It's a cookie half-baked in a skillet and served with mounds of ice cream - all melty, ooey, gooey goodness brought right to your table.  Mmm.
I tend to get a little...hmm...well...you've seen those Snickers commercials right?  That's me...I'm some lunatic when my blood sugar is low and then my friends have been known to say "She's back" once I've been fed.  Our poor waitress had to be so patient and kind with me while I ordered because I wasn't making a whole lot of sense and then she was perceptive enough to tell me one of the dishes I was considering would take substantially longer to cook than the other.  Bless her!  
The drink glasses are also HUUUUGE!  This may have been the one time I regretted not ordering a soda - big always looks more delicious to me.  
We thought the prices were a little steep when we were looking over the menu, but then all five of us ate until we were going to pop and we still got two more meals out of the leftovers.  Can I get an Amen?  Seriously.  Loved it.  Some of the pasta could have used more sauce, but that was really the only complaint.  The ranch dressing is Kick-A.  

Our friend took us here during our Phoenix vacation and said it was a local favorite.  Yes, indeed!  If I ever hit up Phoenix again I am absolutely making sure Oregano's is on the agenda!So much fun for all ages.  Be careful of the foam pit, it is not very deep.On a Monday evening, I brought my family to buldogis this time and we pretty much ordered the whole menu. haha. I can't remember everything, but here's what was new that i liked...

- Angry kimchi fries: great taste. kim chi not too hot. sweet potato fries were crispy. i love eggs made over-easy :)
- Euro special fries: i think taste better than the angry kimchi fries. the mayo gives it a nice zest. french fries stay warmer longer than the sweet potato fries. bacon with fries are always delicious.
- bulgogi buger: very flavorful. highly recommended! 
- budogi burger: from what i could remember, i prefer the bulgogi burger better. 
- angry kimichi hot dog: not too spicy. pretty much the same toppings as the fries but with bulgogi on top too. 

- We forgot to check-in to get the 10% off, but she allowed us to get something off of the menu for free. very friendly :)! definite +Amazing coffee and awesome people! Had a blast there and the ride to LA will be that much easier now.The Barrymore has a killer menu, fantastic staff, a well priced wine list, and is a Vegas restaurant you must try before it gets too popular. Largest serving of foie gras I think I've ever been served. Lobster mac n cheese was to die for. This is a must try!While the bar was a convenient place to stop for a drink going to or from the tables, I especially enjoyed breakfast here.  The daytime bartender, Chelsei, was awesome in recommending drinks or food items.  She recommended the Braised Rib Eggs Benedict for breakfast and it was incredible.  It was a little pricey at $24 ($26 if you arent a total rewards member), but it was Vegas so I didnt mind splurging a little bit.  Over my 4 days in Vegas last week, I probably stopped at Central 8 or 9 times and enjoyed every stop.Just amazing! The teriyaki chicken was really good and the overall look of the place is so cool :D not much to pick from, but hopefully more stuff will be added onto the menu. overall, I LIKE IT!Shocked to see poor reviews! Here is the thing, this place is a taco spot. Not a rice and bean specialty store. The tempura fish tacos are the best in the valley, and the prices are so reasonable that you can afford a beer with your meal! Stick to the tacos. Or call uncle fucking ben.So so good!! Not only is the food great the service is excellent!! Awesome job! Plus kids eat free Sunday and free ice cream!Stopped by again after picking veges at Gilcrease to pick up some fresh eggs and was fortunate enough to meet the owner, Sharon Linsenbardt. What a wonderful person, with so much heart! She spent time showing us around and introducing us to the animals, which by the way are all rescue. Her history is impressive, along with her knowledge about the flora and fauna of the area.  Donations are $1 per person, which is nominal considering how much work it takes. The farm continues to remain charming to me, and now even more so!Fun celebrations. Happy staff and a fun, ready to serve attitude. Maybe that's why thus chain can handle being sandwiched between On one bey 2 major steakhouse players.  Just a team worth giving a real shot to wow youChis has been my masseuse for over 2 years now.  He does wonderful deep tissue work and is extremely professional and friendly. I tried many different spas and masseuses when I first moved to Las Vegas and instantly knew when he started working on my back that he was going to be the person I used regularly.  He gives an amazing massage at a great price :-)World class right here. World fuckin class. This shit is unbelievable. The best pastries I've ever had in my life. Way over the top. Way to be Chef.Pretty wonderful 1st try.  Empty at lunch, but that means the chef took time to come out and chat.  Knows his way around the kitchen *and* Europe.  Between the true italian sense and flavors, and great beer list, it's a must return.  Bringing a group on Friday!I needed my tile and grout cleaned and sealed, and luckily, I found Carpet Star.  Steve did a great job on our grungy ceramic tile and white grout.  Compared to other companies that I called, his prices were very reasonable.  He arrived on time on the day of the cleaning, and the price was exactly what he quoted me on the phone.

I was impressed with his attention to detail, and he was able to get the grout cleaner than I had expected.  He also sealed the tile and grout for me.  

I will definitely use him again for any tile or carpet services that I need.   

Oh, and I appreciated that he followed up a few days later with a phone call to ensure that I was satisfied with the cleaning.I walked here in the heat and was immediately greeted with an ice cold beer. For free! It was a delicious IPA and the staff couldn't have been friendlier. There were even snacks. I also had another sample of their Camelback ale. Both were heaping samples, almost a full cup. The tour was fun and informative. The co owner George even gave me and my boyfriend a ride to the lightrail stop!! We didn't bring our bikes. So awesome.  Definitely recommend. Lovely way to spend a Saturday afternoon.Love this brewery's Watermelon Ale. I walked away with a 6-pack for $9.50. It's $5 to taste four beers. During my visit they had the regular four beers on tap and two experimental ones. The staff is friendly and you feel right at home when you walk through the doors.Great bagels, great prices and great service... that's all that needs to be said... and I'm from NY.So delicious!! We had the Big Wac, samosas, and the bbq salad. It was all fresh and wonderful.  The service was really good too. We will be back!!We love this place!  We've tried different venues and nothing compares thus far.  It is a family owned restaurant - I always support family businesses.  Very nice people...and delicious sushi.  My husband and I always spend at least $70 plus dollars on sushi only here.  Yes, we can eat that much :)  We live down the street from another sushi restaurant here in Tempe but we would rather drive all the way to Gilbert for this place.  If you like tuna get the Tiger roll.  We always get the what the heck and the sixty nine...whatever you get you won't be disappointed.I dig this place. The first time I visited Herbs and Flavors, it was by accident.  I was on my way to the Hydroponic store on McClintock and Broadway, because I was trying to get into gardening.  Mainly because I wanted to grow my own food.  You know? Nothing is fresh as what you grow in your backyard.  

Well. I stopped in and I was surprised how dang good the food was here.  Everything is super-fresh, and it seems that they tend to care about the quality of the stuff that goes into their food.  Which is great in my book.  I had the Herb's and Flavors appetizer sampler thing, and it was awesome.  Hummus hummus and hummus is always a perfect combination for a sampler.  

I like this place.. it's got that mom and pop charm, and has a lot of natural light.  Service was good, food was great, and the price was right.  I'll probably stop by there again in the next month, week, or maybe tomorrow.This is a review for "THE GATES OF HELL"

  Let me first start by saying that I'm not a big fan of haunted houses due to the fact that I feel alot of them are cheesy and the suspense factor is mediocre, but this one my friends is insane!  This year the Freakling Bros. introduce a new haunting experience where you are actually required to sign a waiver prior to entering.  It's the first of its kind in Vegas and is considered to be an R-Rated adventure.  Why you ask?  Well, I do not want to give too much of the details away, but let's just say that you will be touched, you will be surprised, and you will get cursed at!  You've gotta check it out for yourself!  Location:  95N / Rainbow in the United Artists Promenade.  There are 3 haunted houses there , but the one I am referring to is called "The Gates of Hell".

Pros:
 * Scary as Hell !  They definitely had my heart pumping
 * $12. . . not bad for a good scare
 * pretty lengthy walk through the Gates of Hell (oh yeah!)
 
Cons:
 * super long,slow lines (they only let 5 people in at a time)
 * there was a door malfunction while we were waiting so the long wait turned into an even longer wait!

Tips:
 * if you get cold easily, make sure to bring a sweater
 * get there early or else be ready to stand in a long line
 * there is a special deal that saves you money if you check out all 3 hauntings ($27)
 * ATM available on-site, but save money and get cash prior to avoid ATM fees
 * Hot Dogs, Nachos, and Pop available
 * Use the restroom prior to going
*You can print discount coupons onine: http://www.freaklingbros.com/couponsignup.html

Overall:
Recommended... Highly recommended!  I'd definitely go again!Had delicious carne asada tacos and shrimp tacos here! The salsa was also very tasty. Good sound level on the music and lots of tvs for my dad to watch sports on. Fun decorations everywhere. Very nice waitress and prompt service. Will definitely return!5 O'Clock Somewhere in Vegas is a must see, the bartenders are a blast to watch
and strive to put on a show. Drinks are very good and made with style; if you have not
seen a waterfall created your missing a real treat. Rock on Vlad, Sushi and Billy.
From the "Green Mts." thanks.I have been going to the Joint since May 2012. I have had many back problems for most of my adult life. I left NY and moved to AZ and was blessed to have found Dr Brian Grow. This guys knows what he is doing. He has a very calm and authoritative manner.
He worked on the musculature of my jaw helping me with my TMJ pain and always has some type of suggestion of things I can do on my own. 

Definitely, a great chiropractor for a seriously great price. Worth it!This place is the biz..i went in here with my boy Big Juice and our pregnant friend Alan the owner was really nice he treats us like family he made a special raspado for our pregnant friend and said "las mujeres embarasadas ahi que consentir las"  will be going back Ramon is trippin dougI love this place for being VEGETARIAN FRIENDLY!!!   Stop the presses and don't cook dinner, just go here.  If you're living really far from here, fill up your gas tank and make the drive!  The Owner and staff are awesome. Food is some of the best I've had and it's good quality.  Yes, I'm a vegetarian and I also bring some of my meat loving friends who also enjoy it. I can't say enough about this restaurant and the only complaint I have is I can't afford to eat there for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.The service by our waitress Sally was amazing. She was friendly, efficient and made us feel like we were the most important people in the place.  Food came out fast and it was delicious. We will be back for sure...a lotGreat time on the club crawl. 3 clubs ( 1Oak, Haze, and tryst). Fun hostesses on the bus. And free book. I highly recommend the crawl if you are trying to party on a budget.I ran off into the night, hair flying, hands clutching both sides of the paper plate. I'd ordered from Pizza People before; my date had not. Ideally, I'd never let him. 

The perfectly crisp gluten-free crust, vegan cheese that tasted like rich white cheddar & mozzarella (rather than vomit), and the delicious smattering of mushrooms and basil adorning that personal pizza had won my heart long before he could, and that is how it was destined to stay. After giving up dairy and gluten, all that was left of a pizza was the tomato sauce. Somehow, I was enjoying a pizza, sans tomato sauce, dietary restrictions in tact!

Crouched behind a graffiti'd wall, I ravaged that pizza with a passion reserved only for the glory that emerges from the Pizza People truck.Super helpful and they were able to get my wedding programs printed and folded the same day! YayDr Jazz was great! Im used to chiros that put me through an assembly line not even really noticing the issue. Dr Jazz is more thorough and takes the time to treat the problem and help prevent it from triggering in the future. Thank you doc :)This place has the best cheddar bread balls I have ever had. Similar to other Brazilian buffets. Flip your card over if you want meat, flip it over if you don't. Customer service was amazing. People will check up on you frequently making sure everything is fine. Bacon covered sirloin was my favorite.Holy Meat on a Stick!!!This is the best Brazilian place I have been to. I have been to one in Toronto, and this out succeeds by far. Go for lunch as it is the same menu. Seems many famous people eat here. Service is unbelievable, they ask how you like your meat, and then seem to have most cuts at that doneness. Wish they would bring an outlet to Toronto, as the similar places are not the same quality. Go here, and don't go to the casino buffets!!!Time and time again, I've seen people post Facebook and Instagram photos of destroyed shrimp shells while wearing bibs and smiles. I've heard raving reviews and excited news for the first Boiling Crab location in Las Vegas.

This made me highly skeptical. I was 100% sure that this was one of the cases in which people brought my expectations up too high and I would be disappointed in the actual product.

I. Was. Wrong. Service was quick - employees were all young, energetic, and on point. Tables were lined with wax (?) paper to avoid any mess and allow for quick cleaning. Decor was unique and beachy with lots of wood features.

I got a pound of shrimp with potatoes in medium lemon garlic sauce. The sauce is so amazing...I just can't. Upon request, they give you salt, pepper, and lime, to make your seafood taste even better! I also tasted the whole shabang sauce and corn, which was just deliciously delicious deliciousness. The sweet potato fries were crispy and fresh as well.

Water came in plastic to-go cups, which is awesome because I reuse them for smoothies at home. The atmosphere is loud and lively in the restaurant, with many large parties.

Since I'm a big fan of crawfish, I'll probably go back and try it in the very near future.Great food. I had the lamb Adana Kebap and my husband had the Ishkender Kebap his was excellent. Service was friendly and we look forward to returning.Hands down, the best fried zucchini i've ever had :)

I will be back for more.Great Burgers half pound angus beef........we received a coupon and tried the burgers.......called in a pizza order for delivery........they have a great meat lovers pizza.........they have plenty of other pizzas but we keep reordering the same pizza each time..........Corner of Westcliff & Buffalo.....not many places to eat in that area.....so were lucky to have this one just open up..........They are inside the Bounty Hunter Gaming Lounge.........call they will deliver  684-5888My new favorite place in the valley! The bruschetta was terrific - my favorite was the smoked salmon but the pistachio, date, mascarpone was delicious as well. All 3 of us loved our entrees - extremely creative and the flavored blended incredibly well. Great job chef!!If you like really, really good beers and a great patio, there is none better..... (Make sure you hit the BACK patio, not the one out front.....).   We did Camelback Mtn in the morning and got here about 1:00...just in time for their $6.00 happy hour mini pitchers....   Both made for a great day....WOW this place is a hidden gem. I am so lucky that I live super close to it! They have one of the best sourdough pizza crusts and pizza sauce! I so far had the Pork Rules and 5 cheese pizza's and man... they are addicting!!! It's so hard to diet, when you have places like this around where you live lol. I wish they were open 24-7 so I can come here every other day for a slice of pizza after a long session at the Aria Poker room.Walked up tonight and the manager said,  "welcome back" The hostesses were very friendly and the waitress too. Food came out quick and was delicious. Very comfortable environment. Love this place!!! For sure the nicest staff in town
Jennifer and louGood food, and very warm service!  Plus, they had a band tonight!!

Love the Lomo Saltado...I've tried a bunch of other things on other trips, but just wanted to get to the main course tonight.  Everything we've had here has been tasty, and the people who work there are very friendly.  One of my favorite places!I have never shopped at Ted Baker despite how badly I've always wanted to but over this last weekend I had a wonderful experience with the Scottsdale AZ location. I had the opportunity to style an editorial photo shoot for a magazine and pulled product from their store. This was the very first time I've ever styled a shoot with expensive high-end product and lets just say I was a little nervous. The manager Anthony was great at helping me understand the process of everything and made me feel comfortable about the transaction. It was a seamless and fun experience. I'm always a fan of good customer service and you will definitely get that if you shop at this location! 

Plus, the clothes are jaw dropping. I want everything.Excellent two hour massage with Shylia.Great place!~  We had a birthday party here last ngiht and the staff was wonderful.  I'm so happy to see a nice place like this in Mesa.  The food was really good to.  Thank you Danell for all your help!

Great for a group event.One of my new favorite places to eat for NY style pizza and it is within 2 miles of my other 2 favorite NY style joints! What sets DeMarco's apart from the other two is the decor and ambiance (I'll still go to the other two when I don't want to sit-down and only grab some quick slices). They spared no expense in remodeling the space that was formerly occupied by Atlanta Bread Company;  very nice! 

We ordered a large with sausage, mushrooms, and spinach along with a Mediterranean salad. Loved he salad. But what I really enjoyed was the crust: thin and slightly chewy. I was told by the waitress that they used distilled water for drinking and making the dough. Perhaps that is the secret just like how Grimaldi's does it? Speaking of Grimaldi's, which my wife likes more, I prefer the chewy crust unlike Grimaldi's thin, cracker-like crust. Plus, Grimaldi's decor is nowhere as nice as DeMarco's.Thai Peanut Chicken sandwich was really good. Give it a try..........................................We stayed at the hotel Palomar and walked down to the Breakfast Club 2 days in a row. It was GREAT both days! We sat outside both days and enjoyed the great weather. 

The service was prompt and can't really say anything negative about this spot. 

We'll be back!I have been doing business with Tobia's Automotive for over three years now and have found their repair facility to be the best  in all aspects.  From the time you walk in and greeted by Mike and Seth to the time your car is delivered in front fixed and ready to go!  Andy Tobias is a hands-on owner that truly cares about each repair job being the correct repair and being done right and on time.  I have had all types of repairs done and am totally satisfied with each job they do.  They explain every repair prior to starting the job and will answer any questions I may have in detail.  The facility is clean, a AAA referred place to do business!  I would recommend Tobia's Automotive to anyone that wants a great repair job done at the right price and in the time specified!
Alan S.  PhoenixIt's now been several months--almost a year, really--and I would say this is our home-away-from-home.

Okay, okay, not quite, but it is just about my favorite place to visit. The gaming center is still super clean and awesome, the selection is excellent (with tons and tons of family games!), and just... perfect store. 

But the best part? Brian, the owner. Not only is he super friendly, he's willing to go above and beyond for his customers. Looking for a type of game, but don't know what there is? He'll help you. Interested in a game, but don't know for sure if you want to buy it? Test it out! And Brian and/or his awesomely cool employees will even help you through the rules! Want a game that's not in stock? These guys will do their best to help you find it.

This place is an excellent store, and when you add the absolutely stellar service (I mean it -- seriously the best service I've gotten anywhere, ever. No exaggeration.), it is the only place to go in the Madison area for games.Great family owned service, came out and fixed my GE washer which was no longer under warranty. Called GE, quoted me $89 to show up, then plus parts and labor. EV Appliance Repair came out and fixed the washer for $101.53 including parts and labor. GE service would have been at least that plus another $89, forget that and call local!Went here for my birthday with my family.  On all accounts, it was amazing!  For one, Scottsdale has needed a good tapas place.  Now we have it.  The service was fantastic, the atmosphere is fun and funky, and the food is fabulous.  My mom loved the chips and guac.  The guac was nice and limey.  My favorites were the steak in adobo and the chorizo shrimp tacos.  Though it's tapas, you actually get a good bit of food in each item.  My suggestion is to start with 2 plates per person and then build from there.  We over ordered, but it was amazing.
Will definitely be back.I love this place! They have fresh tuna and salmon. The sushi are absolutely great but just not authentic. They have been Americanized, which are still tasty. It is a good place to hangout with friends and listen to Asian songs!Best BBQ I have had in Las Vegas. The pork was perfectly smoked and tender. The sauce was awesome and unique, this place blows everywhere else away.This place is amazing. 

Immediately stepping out of my car into their parking lot the smell of bbq smoke floods your nose. You know it's going to be good. 

I must say, to my disappointment that I did not get to try as much as I should have. I had the Pull "Piggy" as it's called, which is pulled pork on a hoagie roll. I read some other reviews that it was pretty large and since I was coming for lunch I didn't want to over do it. My mistake. It wasn't that big at all. Simple six-inch hoagie roll stuffed with smoked pulled pork with a drizzle of their bbq sauce and some green onions. It was very stuffed, but I still wasn't full afterwards. My fiance got a sandwich as well, the beef brisket. Both were absolutely amazing. The meat is tender and packed with flavor. The bbq sauce isn't overwhelming and heavy - enough to add flavor and more moistness. 

All-in-all, I cannot wait to come back to this place. They have AYCE for $25, anytime any item. Challenge accepted, soon.fresh chicken and the dipping sauce is awesome. sounds funny but they have the best ice for drinksBest chicken fingers I've had! Love the sauce, bread, and fries. The lemonade is really good too. I think this place is way better than chick film a! Plus it's open late if you get those late night cravings!They are very knowledgeable and don't hurt you! I can't tell you how many times I've left a place hurting . This place uses sns which is great. They arevery well priced as well. I will be coming back from now on:)Great tattoo shop. Highly recommend Anthony Ortega!!!


I wouldn't let anyone else in Las Vegas tattoo me.I've been back to MadCat countless times since my first review, and with every visit it's more of exactly the same:

- QUALITY products
- SUPER friendly service
- AWESOME staff

I could continue to gush about MadCat and its wonderful staff, but I won't.  Just do yourself a favor and check them out in person.  You won't be disappointed.  

I'd visit them even if I didn't have any pets.  That's how great they are.Top-notch service Matthew is the best. Very friendly very courteous and does a wonderful job. Highly highly recommend.I love this place! I've been here twice now and walked out with great finds both times. They have a large variety of clothes - work-appropriate & fun cocktail dresses, fabulous shoes, jewelry, casual skirts and shirts, and more. The employees are very friendly and helpful. 

Another reviewer mentioned $700 boots, but I haven't seen a single item priced over $100.  I actually got gifts for my cousins, 2 hair and jewelry items apiece, for under $20 per person (and in the same visit found a dress for less than $40 that got me half a dozen compliments at a holiday party that night!)Wow nachos - best nachos anywhere.Used a lot of other cleaners in the past but finally found someone worth using again. Not only do these guys do amazing work they're actually good people to boot. Would highly highly recommend to anyone reading this.I recently bought a Living Social deal to try out this place and now I am addicted.  For 60 minutes, you are put through an intense workout that will definitely put a shake up to your workout routine.  I love the challenge of the workouts and they make me push myself further so that I get the best out of the workout.  This place offers a group workout split between treadmill work and a combination of rowing machine and weights/TRX.  If you are looking to mix up your workout, Orange Theory will push you to a new fitness limit.nice patio - good foodI'll admit it, I hate giving out 5 stars.  I'm just so stingy, I think 5 out of 5 should be  reserved for near perfection.  I had no choice Baby Stacks.  You left me no out.  5 out of 5 it is.

  The people have spoken.  And they said they want red velvet pancakes from Baby Stacks Cafe.  So who am I to argue?  For my first trip to this highly recommended breakfast stop, I got the velvet short-stack along with a side of scrambled eggs and a glass of milk.  Very basic.

FOOD:  The short-stack was 3 smaller thick pancakes, which was just right for me to feel full but not disgusted with myself.  I've never had red velvet pancakes, but why haven't I heard of this sooner?!  It's one of the most delicious things on earth.  The perfect sweetness, texture, toppings - man, I just can't do these things justice.  Trust me when I say they are straight from heaven.  

SERVICE: The only thing sweeter than my short-stack was my server.  "Yvette" I believe was her name, a young Hawaiian-looking girl with the happiest attitude without a hint of fakeness.  She was smiley, quick to greet and take my order, always asking if there was anything else she could do, checking up on me just right.  And my food came out ridiculously quick.  I was pleasantly impressed!

DECOR:  The restaurant is fairly small, but cozy, clean, refreshing, and new in appearance.  You can tell someone took pride in it.  The small bar style seating area was neat.  There was a TV.  Soothing, light, uplifting music.  Very nice colors, plants, decorations, new furniture (tables and booths) and overall just extremely well taken care of.

I honestly can't find a single negative thing to say.  It was such a nice breakfast.  They really earned my stingy 5 star rating!  I wish it was next door to my apartment!In town for kids' basketball this past August. We found this on yelp, wanted to give it a try. I can't stop thinking about the carrot cake pancakes. And their garlic fried rice. The staff was friendly, willing to offer recommendations, and the food was delicious. There's easy parking, and the place is kid friendly. Good enough for me! Can't wait to go back.Awesome! I now eat here every week for breakfast.  This place is 25 mins from home and worth every minute of the drive.  I usually eat 2 breakfasts just so I can try everything! Portuguese Sliders! Super awesome! See you next week BabyStacks!Dear Hibachi; please come back! We miss you. Restaurant closed about Feb 7th, 2013. This was the best Hibachi out of all of them here in the Phoenix area. Great food all the way. Excellent selections to choose from. The a/c was cranking good in the hot summers. The wait staff were very attentive and polite. Very spacious. The price was right at 8 bucks a person including drink. I was very saddened to see it close. The management actually cared about you as a customer ; )Amzing nightclub! With great DJs its a must see nightclub if your las vegas check it outI have finally found my favorite nail salon!  After many years of living in Las Vegas and trying numerous salons for pedi's and mani's, this place wins them all over. Right when you walk in the door you know this place is MUCH better then all the other salons on every corner of this city.  They are very clean and professional.  Plus its super cute inside and smells great! (no chemicals ladies!) I got a full set of gel nails that look great and have gotten many compliments on them.  I plan to go back every 2 weeks to keep my nails looking great!look for it, look for it... wait turn around.... you found it.  Now go in and enjoy... THANK YOU Tucker, Kevin - drinks were great! First timer here and already have plans to come back on Saturday. Walls are lined with cross-sectioned logs, place has an over all rustic feel. Glowing red bar adds some fun.  Definitely deserves a few returns.I have been going here since it opened, but never gave a review. I have gotten my eyebrows done at different places in town. I've been a regular at DB, Eyebrows R Us, and Patel's. What I did not like about those places is that they did not take their jobs professionally. At DB, if they're on the phone they will make you wait until they finish their conversation, and they have done this to me a couple of times already. Given that I have done that once during a visit, but it was for a very good reason. Patel's customer service was lacking. Both DB and Eyebrows R Us are not as careful as Shila's. Shila's was the only place where they never cut me or left blood marks. I don't really trust DB and Eyebrows R Us anymore because my eyebrows were a little bit uneven every time I get them done at their places. Shila's would take their time to make sure that my eyebrows were perfectly even. Threading hurts less when I go to Shila's. I just love their friendly and professional atmosphere. I don't trust my eyebrows anywhere else but Shila's. I have tried almost every eyebrow threading business in town, and Shila's is by far the best. Her business has the best deals, best service, great hours, great location, and I love their cute little place. :)It seems to me that the optical business is often a shell game. But I did not get
that feeling here. Dr Jordan was terrific. There was no hard sell and they had the 
glasses ready when promised the next morning.Oh wow. So good. Stopped in here several times for lunch and each time has been amazing.The service is really. And my phone just like grade new one. Think I will let all my friends know about this placeWhat a great new concept!  I love how you can create your own sushi roll.  You start by selecting brown or white rice, seaweed or soy paper then veggies, meat/fish and top it with your choice of sauce(s).  If you aren't creative they have some menu items already created for you.  And, to also note, if you aren't a fish fan, they have chicken and beef as well.  Each roll comes with 10 pieces, so portions are big.  The food is fresh and it was a blast to create my own roll. I will definitely go back!!!  Well done!I thought I left a review already Hhhmmm.. Ok. Great local mail center. It's nice to have right here since I hate going to the post office. Ugh. Snow Birds are coming back soon. They don't come to this side of town (well unless its Senior Movie Day!) so it's nice for us local residents to have a place to go, get in and out quick. Always with a smile.Team Tile and Stone renovated our two bathrooms and did a wonderful job.  The bathrooms are beautiful.  Team Tile and Stone are true professionals. They are dependable, arriving on time and completing the job in the time frame that said they would do it in.  They are neat and their workmanship is top notch.  I would highly recommend them.Definitely can see why the customers are loving this  place. They have good coffee, provide stevia, and the staff are very friendly.My extended family has been coming here for 5 or 6 years for our annual Family Christmas celebration. We are a big, loud, rambunctious lot. Each year we rent out a ton of rooms and reserve the conference room for our festivities and over-abundance of food.

The rooms are spacious and comfortable. The beds and pillows are clean and soft. The conference room is large and perfect for our use.

The staff is super friendly and incredibly accommodating. In particular, Mary at the front desk is a joy. She is always super helpful (manning the camera for our family photo in the lobby) and on the ball, as well as anticipating our needs (bringing recycling bins for us to use, showing up with a giant bowl full of ice).

Staying here has always been a pleasant experience!If you are looking for great service and a ridiculous amount of gel options this place is perfect for you! I got a pedicure and a gel manicure and they both turned out great. I absolutely love glitter and gel nail polish and they have a huge selection of super glittery and gorgeous choices! Charlie did my gel manicure and was very friendly, knowledgable and did an amazon job. Definitely would recommend anyone go there and I will be going back to try out all the different glitter gels!:)I love this place!I was hesitant about the prices for the oil change, but when you consider the quality of the oil and how long the oil change will last you, it's actually very reasonable.
Went in for a standard oil change, they have a special running for the synthetic blend. The waiting area is really nice and clean, they had complimentary beverages, Keurig coffee choices, ice cream sandwiches, and cookies. Lots of magazines for you to read too. Receptionist was very nice and friendly. At the end they give you recommendations for services, they weren't pushy about it either. They changed my windshield wipers ($15) and brake light bulb ($15), saving me lots of time. 
Great place, definitely going to come back.I was just here for an inspection on what my car needed and the experience was wonderful. All day I have been calling around and looking for a reasonable mechanic. I was just about to give up when I stumbled on a post on Reddit/r/vegas recommended this place. I called up and I got a reasonable quote and I quickly brought my car to their shop to get a proper inspection. Before I went here I had gone to a brake shop (Midas) in Missouri who told us we needed new brake pads. This was not true. Hamid told me I still had about 6 months until I had to change pads. 

In the brief time I spent there waiting for my car (oil change/ inspection) they fixed a flat tire free for the owner of Tofu Hut, they took a women to a local nail spa, and I met a handful of local regulars who had nothing but praise for the shop and owner. This is our new car shop, for oil, brakes and all maintenance.  

This is as good as it gets.You definitely have to wait as they don't have that many tables but we had the gyoza, fried rice and all different kinds of ramen. We all loved everything and even in the 90 degree weather we still enjoyed a bowl of hot noodles!Great food and consistently fast service. They also have delivery which is a nice feature, definitely worth checking out!Dropped my Samsung GS4 and the screen was shattered.  The phone would turn on but it the screen remained black.  

I took it to Kandel, and he replaced the screen in about a half hour that same day.  He also fixed the sound - it wasn't making any sounds since I had dropped it.  

The service was quick, effective, and EXACTLY what I needed.  Phone works great once again!  I will definitely be returning to Smart Fix for any other phone/computer related issues. 

Thanks, Kandel!!Everything is fantastic!! We love how all of the employees work as a team, they are all so helpful! Bruschetta is a MUST! The Butcher Block is also amazing! Who am I kidding everything they have is great, so fresh, delicious and obviously made to order!Always happy/satisfied when I leave. They have great lunch specials!Sushi Koma
Overall 5 Stars

Gold medal- UNI x 2
Silver medal - AYCE Scallops
Bronze medal - Mochi ice cream

Everytime I come here the sushi is super fresh!  This place has the BEST service that is why I had no problem giving them 5 stars.  All the waitresses are so helpful and nice.  They check on you quite often to make sure you have enough food on the table and food ordered to be on the way to the table.  

The uni here is really fresh and melt in your mouth.  Only bummer is that there is a 2 uni limit per person :(  

The scallops here are large and sweet.  AUCE!!  No limit!

They offer a mochi ice cream ball for dessert.  My favorites are the strawberry and the green tea.

Sushi Koma is always fresh, but they do not offer sashimi.  Hikari is another AYCE sushi restaurant in Las Vegas and they have AYCE sashimi, but the sushi there is not as fresh as Sushi Koma.  Can't win them all right.  You either eat the rice and get full faster or you eat fish that isn't as fresh, but still good.  Which do you prefer?

HAPPY KOMAING!!I came into see Jesse a couple months back.  I have multiple issues that include my shoulder/neck, back and knees.  I was convinced that I was plagued and would not be able to feel good ever again.  I found Jesse and it has been all uphill.  I cannot believe the progress that he has made with me.  I was seeing him every other week and now I see him once a week because I see the difference he has made.  He pointed out all of the pain I thought were major injuries were basically tightness in certain areas of my body.  He is very knowledgeable about the body and even gave me stretches I can do on my own.  He has helped me so so so so much.  I finally feel relief.  Thanks JesseGreat food truck set up in China town.  I have tried a few of their tacos and all have been great.  My husband is a fan of their version of chitlen tacos.  Great prices and great food for that late night hunger strike.If you want a great cut, friendly service, and a happy pet -- see Sean! I met him when he worked at Puppy Enterprise and followed him to his new location Barks and Bubbles. When I pick up my two dogs, a silky terrier and a toy poodle mix they always look terrific and are happy!Although I don't usually seek out Thai restaurants, koolthai is located close to my shop so I have eaten there several times. Since I am a "meat avoider", they have prepared their dishes with tofu for me. All have been delicious. Decor is very nice, not just another restaurant  in a strip mall! Reasonable prices. I'll be back.Really excellent place for lunch while I stayed at the Holiday Inn Express down the street. The soups and sandwiches were my go to for those four odd days I spent in Edinburgh. Really interesting and efficient cafe experience. I Heart Cafe is super unique and relaxing. Your choice of high bar tables, low tables, and some couches. This place seemed to function as a cultural hub for cafe goers, the huge bulletin board with events and postings really gave the place a sense of heart warming camaraderie.  Hope to visit again!EXCELLENT !!!!!! Real food. Delightful staff. Had a sampler platter for two. Yummy. Reasonable prices. Will definitely return.This place is just awesome. I took the platinum tour. The theme-park like tour through the production of whisky was nicely done and instructive. 

The tasting lets you taste the single malts from the different regions (why only two..?), with some explanation about the tastes.

The last few stops on the your are truly amazing. The way in which they display the largest collection of Scotch whisky bottles (well over 3000 different bottles) is absolutely stunning. The very last bit of this selection is in a whisky bar with an outstanding collection and a some nice views.

If you like whisky and you have at least half a day in Edinburgh: do it!If I could eat pita jungle every day I WOULD!!! My favorite things to order are jalapeño cilantro hummus with chicken, the Greek salad, the mahi mahi dish, and the chicken shwarma.  Great happy hour here and the menu isn't expensive.  Love love love some pita jungle!!!!!!!!!Oh, hello you beautiful, gorgeous, wonderful store. 

Is it obvious that I'm a fan of Topshop? Because just in case it's not, I can say it again and again. 

I've done lots of shopping through Topshop online, but this was my first time in an actual store. I was struck with how bright, vibrant and put together it was. You get so used to the messy state of Forever 21 and some department stores that you just nearly come to expect it - until you go into places like this and you remember what standards are about. I loved being able to move comfortably around the store without running into other racks or customers, and I really enjoyed the organization of the store. The Topman store was connected to Topshop so men and women could shop in the same setting but in their own respective sections, and that was a nice touch as well.

I just can't say enough good things about Topshop.A few friends and I wanted to "splurge" while in Vegas.  My friend made reservations for us a few weeks ahead of time.  I figured it would be awesome but after coming in and seeing Christina (winner from Hell's Kitchen) I was sold.  However, that was only the beginning.  

Although, it was a bit full in the bar and we had to stand for a few minutes drinking  spectacular drinks in fancy glasses the night had just gotten started.  We had to wait a few minutes after our reservation time - totally worth it as Gordon Ramsey himself was in the house!!!!!  He hung out for about 20 minutes and took pictures.  Awesome!! 

We were seated at a table that faced the kitchen - I felt like we were at the VIP table in Hell's Kitchen!! Freddy, our waiter, and Johnny were awesome.  Polite, funny, knowledgeable, fun and very attentive.  The staff look like models!! When they bring out your plates it is like a runway show of waiters - all food is delivered simultaneously and set down with perfection.  It was awesome to see that all that perfectionism Gordon Ramsey speaks on TV is exactly what his restaurant displayed!! 

The ipad drink menu, meat display, and personalized attention made me feel like we were definitely getting our monies worth.  We each ordered a different type of meat and sides.  We had the french onion soup, shrimp cocktail and stuffed lobster with chorizo appetizers.  O ... wow each was amazing.  Then came our meals ... the sides are shareable and we each tasted everything.  The Kobe fillet was spectacular and the mac and cheese (yeah I know you think you go to Gordon Ramsey Steak and order mac and cheese??) but I am not joking when I say it had fabulous flavor and was just so creamy and perfect.  I did not want to leave one noodle.  

Just like we had read on-line we got the sticky pudding - there are no words to describe how fantastic this dessert is!! Get it and share ... you will fall in love!!

The check is a bit hard to swallow - but we knew it would be expensive before heading into it.  We would do it again no question.The most amazing dining exerience I have ever had. Gordon walks the talk as does his staff . I don't want this to be long and drawn out so let me make this short & sweet. This experience made me cry! A joyful cry!  Best service, best food ever! Got a Pimms cup ordered from a iPad, had orgasmic (not a spelling error) mushrooms with the famous Beef Wellington and the sticky toffee pudding brought the tears. My advice- dont think, - just go, just enjoy, you will not be disappointed. Mahalo nui loa to Michael, Jean Phillipe, and the staff at GRS. Aloha nui loa!5 stars for the food & service
1 star for personalization

We chose this resto for my bday celebration as I am a HUGE FAN of Gordon Ramsey!

After dining at this LA location in the London and watching his 3 shows, I had to make reservations to his newest establishment in Vegas.

While making reservations, we noted that we were celebrating my bday. No "Happy birthday, no cake, nothing. - points

Otherwise, we had a fabulous night of decadence!

4 different kinds of breads & cocktails to start

Then we ordered the seared foie gras as our appetizer (VERY rich and a large portion)

Next up - the tasting menu. Cooked to perfection were the risotto and beef wellington. Melt in your mouth type food - HIGHLY RECOMMEND!

To end - the AMAZING, orgasmic experience buttered toffee with ice cream. DO NOT SKIP THIS PART!!! You'll thank me later.

The only other - was the signed menu from Gordon Ramsey that we never received. 

Even so, we're coming back with a large party in Oct!!Man, are the reviews for THIS ONE all over the map!

- Finally got back to this Hibachi after over a little over a year, this time joined by Mark R., Robyn N. and Mike C.  What we found here was a huge selection of 156 food choices, plus sauces and dressings.  I started with some really good Hot & Sour Soup, & then it was on to salad, excellent Sushi, and then many of the hot dishes, skipping the Mongolian BBQ this time, due to time restraints.

One of my favorite dishes?  ¡TAQUITOS!  What are THEY doing here?  In any case, the food was great, the service friendly, & factoring in the low pricing, I think they earned 5 Stars this time.  It was all very nice!     :-))

Weekday Lunch Buffet:  $6.99/$6.29 Sr.This place is so yummy!
Being an extremely picky eater, I was very hesitant to try this place. I had never had any type of curry before, and didn't know what to expect. But my old boss convinced me to try it. And I really love it! I'm not a curry connoisseur, this is the only place I've ever eaten it at, but it's awesome.

Plus, everyone who works here is extremely friendly, and even remember my name (which is awesome). They're always extremely patient with me as I struggle to decide between Chicken Katsu and Steamed Veggies (my two favorites) and even offer suggestions to help me be a little more adventurous :-)It was opening day for Marc when I stopped by here. Exciting. Buzzing. Spoke to most lovely Brit gent who manages the fab London Mount St store. He was hungover! Well hard not to be in Vegas. But he was well helpful. 
Big pink metallic elephant in window. Very cool. Staff were lovely. Hubby brought a ring. He regrets not getting the pants and the cuff now as well. Sad. Should always just buy it I say, esp on holiday. They had loadsa cool garms and bits for good prices. Got a Hollywood t-shirt. Random since was in Vegas. But have a practically vintage Marc Jacobs Vegas t-shirt. Top stuff.We had such a great experience at Redemption Tattoo!!  My sister in law and I decided to get tattoos while in Vegas.  Redemption Tattoo took us as walk ins, which was great!  Their minimum was cheaper than any other place we'd tried to go and Jeromy, who was amazing by the way, even gave us a discount.  He made the whole experience a great one and did such an awesome job on our tattoos!  If we ever got more in Vegas, no doubt this would be the place we'd go.  Seem to really care about their work and their customers!!The ladies here are very welcoming and good at their job.  They only have to "stick you once" and they get the blood they need.  Also, they are very welcoming and the wait time is slim to none.  I live closer to the St. Rose area location, but I wouldn't hesitate to drive up here for service.  Thanks!!Great studio and staff! I took advantage of the "out of town week" rate since I was staying in Vegas for 5 days. The studio is 10 mins from the strip and conveniently located in a strip mall which has plenty of parking. This studio is super clean and has separate men's and women's locker rooms with multiple showers available. I took classes with Summer in the early morning and John in the afternoon. Both are good but John is personable, funny, and motivational. I'll be sure to take their classes again next time I am in town.This store was great. Had excellent souveniers and staff. Very clean store. Had everything you would need  from a walgreens back home plus more.  If you need a last minute gift,  come here I did ! LolWould have given a 6 if possible.  A foodie find for sure.  Great service - great food and environment.  You need to try the pig ears!

A very small criticism:  we both had the mushroom/egg dish.  It was very good, however we both thought the egg wasn't organic - which would have given a richer taste.  The egg was also slightly over cooked.  For this dish it should have been runny.great stuffWe had the opportunity to dine here last night. We had a party of 4 and had an 8:30 reservation. The restaurant has no signage in the front so you have to use some detective skills and peak through a little slit of a window to see what's going on inside. The interior is very minimal. There is a sushi bar which seats about 12 and 2 tables which seat 4. The person who took us here recommended coming early (when they open at 6) as fish tends to run out as we learned during our 2.5 hour meal. He also recommended to NOT bring parties bigger than 4. The experience at Kabuto is supposed to be, for a lack of a better term, slow. You're encouraged to take your time, savor each bite, taste the fish and feel the textures.

We each ordered the Omakase ($48/person). We each ordered beer and was also given a glass of mango sake (which I REALLY enjoyed). We started with a little seafood salad (squid, fish, kelp and vinaigrette). Next we had our 10 nigri (which came in groups of 3 and one in a group of 4). The chef decides which fish to serve each night. After our nigiri course, we decided to try 2 more types of fish (the Kelp Grouper and a cut of tuna called the "Triangle"). We were then served toro hand rolls, then dessert. We each got a different dessert (papaya sorbet, mochi ice cream, strawberry layer cake and a custard-type dessert) and shared. The fish was great, the mango sake they served with our meal was delicious, the desserts were great. I really enjoyed my dining experience.

I believe our bill came out to about $250 (for our party of 4). Keep in mind we had Omakase for 4, 2 additional nigiri per person and about 6 glasses of Asahi. This place is not cheap. Please do not come here if you're looking for an AYCE sushi place. Have some respect for the quality of fish and service this place has to offer. It is unlike any where else in Las Vegas. I truly enjoyed my experience here and I look forward to my next.Even if you don't indulge in the rich chocolaty goodness that this patisserie has to offer - please, just go and take a peek.

From the beautiful chocolate fountain that just makes you want to stick your head in and drink, to the amazing art work of cakes they have displayed in the cases surrounding the back of the place... you have to see it to believe it. 

It would be a sin for any chocolate lover to miss this place.I really enjoyed this place! The brats were good and had some unique options for toppings that gave it a different flare. The beer was amazing! I had the Hefeweisen, which had this subtle banana flavor, but tasted amazing. I loved the atmosphere of the outdoor patio area. The service was friendly and quick and helpful with recommendations.I have been coming to see Dr Albrecht and Holly the hygienist for over 15 years and I have received exceptional care and service every time! These folks REALLY care. Dr Albrecht is always on the cutting edge of restorative and cosmetic dentistry and somehow always remembers the details of your past conversations. I don't know if she keeps a journal or has a photographic memory but either way it's pretty awesome.  If you are looking for a dentist.... this is the place to go.I got a menu for this place in the mail a few weeks ago and kept telling myself that I would try this place.  I got there and was greeted by very happy workers, I was seated and they took my drink order right away.  I looked over the menu and I kept going back to the lunch specials and landing on the Mongolian Beef lunch special.  So I ordered it and was very happy.  The waiter asked which kind of soup I wanted Egg Drop or Hot and Sour so I went with the Hot and Sour and I was very pleased with the texture, flavor and spiciness (not too spicy, just enough to let you know it was there).  Within 15 min. of ordering the beef I got the food.  I picked up the fork and tried the beef strip first and it melted in my mouth.  It was very tender and full of flavor; again just enough spice to let you know it was there and not so hot that you couldn't enjoy the other flavors in the dish.   For me everything that was mixed with the beef was very good and full of flavor.  The fried rice was just a good and flavorful, it even seemed lighter than other fried rice that you get at other places.

Several times throughout the meal they came and asked if I needed anything.  They really look after their customers to make sure you are happy and have everything you need during your meal.

I look forward to eating here again and trying another item on the menu.  I hope this place sticks around and does well.  The food was great and the service was just as good.Came in here on a random mid-week night with a few friends. When we got there, we were greeted and seated immediately. Our server was very bubbly and explained every aspect of the restaurant and menu to us. I was incredibly impressed. We all order our food. I got the Rehab BBQ burger (11 oz) and our server recommended the pretzel bun. Food came out quickly and it was soooo good. Hands down one of the best burgers I've ever had. They also had a bunch of awesome dipping sauces and another bottled sauce that's to die for. Everyone I was with loved their food. I was only able to finish half my burger, and I have a big appetite. The fries were great too. It's so nice to find a nicely priced restaurant and bar in Old Town that also has great service and great food. I've already brought friends in again to try it out and they loved it too. Can't wait to go back.THIS PLACE ROCKS. Eat there about once a week now. The Hangover Burger on a pretzel bun with deep fried corn on the cob and $1.50 PBR's cannot be beat. I travel a lot, I always come here the night I get home. The staff is the best. The food is the best. The atmosphere is the best. Instead of a bowl of mints at the door, there is a bucket of jawbreakers. Classic!This place is awesome! We went the Friday before Christmas so it was really slow, but the space is fairly small so I bet it gets pretty packed on an average weekend night. My boyfriend and I split a bunch of tapas and none of them were disappointing. The duck fat fries and dates are musts! Both are very flavorful, and for tapas the portions are decent. Our server was great and we didn't have to wait too long before the dishes started coming out. As with most restaurants on Willy St. you will need to street park.Delicious!  Loved the Veggie Lemon Chicken!!!
Good service, good food.
Quaint little place!I moved down here from Boston in sever need of a cut, I bought the groupon and was paired with Naomi and she was great! I have extremely thick and hard to handle hair which needed to be fixed and she did! I couldn't be happier! I will be back and highly recommend her!The blowout bar had a resident appreciation day and I had a comp blow-out by katelyn. Not only was the style amazing but the service was too! Will definitely be coming here again!Had the bacon/cheddar burger and thought it was amazing. Cooked exactly the way I wanted. This is a huge burger too. This place has the best prices around. Can't beat their happy hour or daily specials anywhere in town.Rolled tacos are awesome & service is always great.Hooked up!!!  I was planning a bachelor party for my lil bro so it had to be good.  I dont know crap about vegas and am outta of the "scene" and all these connection that friend had were NOT working out.  and Im in Vegas, I dont want to spend all this time trying to figure out the activities for the fellas - I want to indulge myself in all the eye candy that vegas is known for.  I told these guys I want the hottest clubs for my boys, .these guys know everyone in vegas and do a great job hooking it up!  Great deals, good times!  I wish I could say more but... "what happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas..." (sorry for the cliche).  I looked like a stud with all the hook ups in Vegas.  Highly recommended!I took my mom here for her birthday breakfast. Everything was great. The food was burning hot right out of the kitchen. The waitress, Liz, was so warm and friendly. My mom had a great birthday breakfast thanks to Sunny's. :)Charming, tasty, whimsical...recommend to try anything but especially the lavender creme brûlée. We had two excellent experiences would visit often if we lived in Madison.Forequarter is the retail, public face of the Underground Food Collective catering company. Distinctively Eastside. Low key, creative, knock-out food. This place popped up on my radar a while ago. Liz B. mentioned it the other day so the Spousal Unit and I invited a friend to go check it out. There's no sign on the building so those of you old folks that don't have smart phones should write down the address before you head out, other wise you'll walk up and down E. Johnson for a while before you find it ;-)

We three snagged the last table for four at about 6:10 on a Thursday night.  The cocktails seemed to be popular but we settled on a bottle of a nice, reasonably priced Sangiovese. When I asked about it she brought me a taste. To start we had: Ripped bread with eggplant and pork rillette and a beet (golden and red) salad. Main course was, for my companions, veal meatballs with green beans and eggplant in a light tomato sauce reduction and for me, roasted goat shank with garbanzos and cucumbers. Conversation slowed, Mmmms were said, happiness ensued. A raspberry buttermilk ice cream served with shortbread cookies dipped in chocolate ganache finished the meal. What a treat!

I've been in some fancier restaurants in Madison since moving here. They've tended to be a bit snooty and formal for my tastes.  Forequarter would fit nicely in my former hometown of Portland, OR.  Laid back, confident and creative. I will most certainly be back for more!Possibly the best restaurant in Madison! Amazing atmosphere, stellar drinks, and rotating menu of amazingly delicious (and usually locally-sourced) cuisine. I have gone here numerous times and had my mind blown by the food here. Often times I will be lukewarm about a potential ingredient on the menu (due to my own eccentricities), but nearly every time I end up loving any dish I get.Great fresh tasting mexican food.  I always say you can tell how good the food is going to be by the chips and salsa.  This place has both fresh chips and salsa with a lot of fresh ingredients along with a variety of entrees, just what Peoria needed.Student-Tutor has helped my son immensely! Our tutor is so knowledgeable, punctual and a dream to work with. Plus, they come to me! As a busy professional, I have a hard time running my son around town. They have provided the perfect experience for me. Thank you!you have to go here!!!!!!
amazing food and good atmosphere. The food is made with such care and good quality. Its so hard to find a place like this.I've been following crepe bar since it's food truck days. I would love to see a local version of Cibo's vanilla bean ice cream and fresh fruit crepe. This place could totally rock it and I know they are down to experiment! So let's see it! Fresh ice cream crepes! Summer is coming show us some love! XoxoEXTERMINATE!  EXTERMINATE!  EXTERMINATE!

When I'm at Rossi's, that's what you'll hear as I'm throwing quarters down the Dr. Who pinball machine. I love those little Daleks up top announcing what an awesome game I'm having.

 

Rossi's has pretty decent thin crust pizza, tater tots just like from elementary school that you order by the pound, and pop in cans. The most fun part of a visit there is the vintage arcade. The main dining area has a few really old games, an air hockey table, and lots of movie posters and memorabilia on the walls. Then off to the side through a little hallway is the black light filled arcade. All games are only a quarter. There is a change machine if you haven't been hoarding quarters in anticipation of a visit here. The first room has loads of old stand up games. Classics like Joust (for your Ready Player One role playing), original Mario Brothers (the one where you have to jump under the bricks to knock off turtles), Dig Dug, Pac Man, Indiana Jones, and more. The second room had a few more stand up games and four pinball machines. The pinball is 50cents, but put in $1.50 and you'll get extra games. Pinball includes the aforementioned Dr. Who, along with Tales From The Crypt, and two others that I can't recall. This room also has Street Fighter, which I am horrible at, and Tekken which will suck the quarters right out of your pocket. In the summers the arcade rooms can get a bit warm will all the machines producing heat and being crowded with people on weekend nights. I'm sure it will feel toasty and comforting in there come wintertime.

When you are finished playing or if your wrists just need a break, they also serve Chocolate Shoppe Ice Cream.

I really think this is one of the hidden gems in Madison, well I guess technically Monona. It's a great activity to do with friends when the weather is crappy outside. Don't let the construction on Monona Dr scare you off. Go and have fun. But if I show up, back away from the Dr. Who pinball because that baby is mine.Great, authentic Chicago-style pizza by the slice or whole. You can also get New York style pizza. This is a small, quint eatery with only 6 stools to sit. It adds to the authentic nature of the concept. 

Chef Anthony also happens to be the Executive Chef of The Venue Scottsdale - it's cool how he can go from upscale plated dishes to easy, simple Chicago favorites. 

This place is even open till 3 a.m. on Thursday-Saturday nights for the Old Town crowd. 

This is a can't miss!I felt inclined to write my first review on Yelp due to this place. You know every kid says Pizza is their favorite food? Well, it's stuck with me and I can call myself a pizza connoisseur among other things (ranch sauce, crab rangoons, meatballs, cheeseburgers, butter etc). So here's the nights order of events:

Step 1: Drink a ton of drinks at Rockbar right across the street.
Step 2: Get hungry as a motha and walk to one of the two late night food establishments around there that I actually knew about. (Didn't know about KISS)
Step 3: I picked the place called "Best of Italy" for a couple slices of pizza.
Step 4: Regret going to Best of Italy because their pizza always sucks but I always hope for the best.
Step 5: Walk back to Craftsman Ct to find a cab.
Step 6: See the open sign at this place called KISS and would love to give my food craving a second chance / make myself an ultra chubby guy.
Step 7: Walk in there and order 2 slices of pizza.

It was about 2:30am and I had no idea what to expect. The place is tiny inside with only a few tables but there were a bunch of people at all of them waiting for their food.  There was no line and I was immediately helped. I got 2 slices of sausage Chicago style stuffed pizza to go. I think the total was something like $10 and I tipped the guy a couple bucks because hey - I wouldn't want to be slinging pizza at 2am but someone is kind enough to do it. The pizza came out within a few minutes and while he was boxing it up he threw in a couple slices of thin crust cheese pizza for free! Fantastic.

I ate a slice of the chicago style while waiting for a cab to come by and was surprised at how good it was. It was legit one of the best chicago style stuffed I've had out here. I'm from the midwest and have been trying to find a place besides Oregano's that has a good stuffed pizza and I think I definitely found my go to spot. I see other reviews say it's only open on Fridays and Saturdays and if that's the case, it's a shame. Either way, you won't be disappointed if you had what I had. Definitely worth 5 stars in my pizza connoisseur book. Now I'm going to go to bed and make love to this other slice.This is the main US Bank location for Phoenix. They are very nice and helpful. I have not had any issues with them. I'm going to continue to bank there, they do a great job.Great bank! Very nice employees, although a slightly weird location. Its located in Scottsdale next to a pizza shop and a best buy in a strip mall. I came in, they printed me checks really quickly, and called it a day. Thanks everyone!!I don't have an account with Chase but I've made some deposits here for other accounts and everyone that works here is always so helpful and kind. 

I would consider opening a Chase account based on my experience at this location. 

Plus they have free cookies =)A few weeks ago girlfriend and I decided we were in need of a girls spa day for some RnR and upon searching all over trying to decide on a place in scottsdale we came across a deal on dealchicken for Kalologie 360. We saw the reviews on yelp and decided to give it a go since it was only $30 for a custom massage which is a steal and I am so glad we gave this place a a chance!

We entered in and it smelled lovely, Iove love the spa smell. We were greeted by a friendly staff and had us take a seat and fill out some paperwork. The waiting area was quite small and was getting pretty packed tight, but our therapist's came and grabbed us right on schedule. I had dominique and oh man oh man he has the heavenly touch! He asked me why I was getting a massage and if he wanted me to focus on anything as well as what pressure I liked which was very much appreciated. He listened to my needs and delivered! My girlfriend had Amber whom she said was awesome as well and really listened and gave great deep tissue massage.

They used hot towels on your neck and back as well as an aroma therapy eye mask when they have you turn over. Surprisingly it was so quiet and didn't hear a sound despite the busy lobby except for the music and that is really important to me when I am getting a massage. I felt like jello afterwards and I must say I am pretty picky with my therapist. Dominique was so good I signed up for the monthly membership there! Its really a great deal $49 and you get one massage, or facial, peel, or microdermabrasion per month. if you don't use it that month it rolls over to the next and just for signing up they give you a a complimentary massage as well. There is 12 month contract and the girl said they are pretty flexible if you ever need to cancel which made me feel good about getting the membership. 

I can't wait until my next visit! If you are hesitating to give this place a try don't.This is nothing like massage envy, its sooo much better!Had an absolutely wonderful time!  So much fun!  Constant entertainment and I had chills every song from how spot on they are to the exact sounds of the original.  I loved that it wasn't just a cover band.  It was a play/performance with a story line to show the actual story of the group through their ups and downs, behind the scenes life and struggles of their personal lives.  I love the music, however my boyfriend who surprised me with the tickets wasn't too familiar until he heard the songs and realized how many he knew.  Even without being a die-hard fan like myself,  he really enjoyed the story line and performances.  Loved everything about this show.I don't get the whole Thrifty's Ice Cream excitement (I think Thrifty's is a little before my time). But I can recognize delicious things and Sweet Addiction has got them!

At Sweet Addiction, my favorites seem to be the most colorful ones in the case. Like a child, I gravitate toward rainbow colored ice creams? The kid in me thinks they'll taste better I guess. Whatever the reasoning is behind my sub-conscious wanting pink and blue, candy-colored ice cream, I'm in love with the Circus Animal Cookie and Birthday Cake. They have other "normal" flavors as well but those are my go-tos. Cookie-wise I'll order whatever floats my boat. I've sampled the chocolate chip and white chocolate macadamia which are both winners. They're soft in the center with a little crisp on the edges--just how I like it! They've got a fridge of beverages with a few different kinds of root beer for.... you guessed it--root beer floats! Tip from the ladies of Sweet Addiction: Don't get too creative with your ice cream choice. Stick with a classic like vanilla because a mint chocolate chip root beer float just sounds nasty.

I rarely eat ice cream. Long story short, I worked at Coldstone and ate too much Birthday Cake Remix. But if I'm taking someone on an ice cream run, Sweet Addiction has that chic, modern, and daresay slightly upscale decor that makes it the cool--but cheap--place to entertain yourself and other people. 5 stars!So I finally made it to the new shop. Its so pretty inside and of course there are all kinds of new items. Now that the store is bigger they are able to offer more services. My son was excited to pick out a new toy for his grandma's dog and of course get love from dozer and princess pebbles. Dee and Kevin always make you feel welcome and your treated like a friend. Not just a customer. And their pack of dogs are always well behaved. I bet those dogs live a better life then most people. There shop is definitely worth checking out.My hubby and I were spending the weekend at the Morongo Casino with a group of friends. The challenge: we each had $20 to spend on an outrageous outfit to wear for the weekend (inspired by the song, no doubt). I lamented that Cheap Thrills wasn't around anymore, because I knew Jeanne would help find the perfect outfit. Google sent me to Pearls, and I was thrilled to walk in and find Jeanne at the front counter! She helped me find the perfect Liz Taylor-inspired look, complete with martini glass loafers.

Just as Cheap Thrills used to be, Pearls is the perfect location for reasonably priced vintage clothes, jewelry, handbags, shoes, etc.I've been wanting to visit Sin City Knit Shop since it opened, but finally got the opportunity to stop in today.  It is such a sweet shop! The owner, Debi went above and beyond to help us, made us feel welcome and left us to explore the shop.  The yarn and needle selection is great and the prices were great.  I bought several sets of needles, found a great pattern and found my new favorite shop.  Please support this shop on Small Business Saturday, stop in to say hello, or bring your project to join the ladies to chat while you work.  You won't be disappointed.My husband and I went in here for the first time a few days ago after reading the stellar reviews.  We were not disappointed - though I am a huge fan of Pita Jungle's hummus, the hummus at Pita Kitchen is great.  Different (it's warm instead of cold, and they don't have red bell pepper, which is my favorite), but very tasty.  Oh, and their pita bread?  Fresh, warm, amazing.  All of the food we tried was wonderful, especially the Greek fries.  Oh man, am I sucker for Greek fries!

The employees are very friendly and helpful as well.  Love this place, we will definitely be going back very soon!BEST BUTTER CHICKEN in the whole wide world!!

On our recent visit to Scotland, we stayed at Sheraton. Just as we stepped outside the hotel, we spotted this Indian restaurant, across the street.
We ordered Chicken Korma & Paratha for dinner. When the Chicken Korma arrived on the table, my husband asked the waiter for some hot sauce in order to spice up the dish,like most Indians would do. The waiter went back, and instead of the hot sauce, arrived a very polite & cordial gentleman - Alok Singh, the Manager of the restaurant. Seeing we are Indians who might not prefer a mild dish like Chicken Korma, which we had already ordered, he asked the waiter to take the Korma away from our table. He proactively offered to order a dish of Butter Chicken to us. We both were a little startled, embarrassed but definitely appreciated his gesture eventually. Great customer service indeed! Once the Butter Chicken arrived, not only did my husband NOT ask for any hot sauce this time, he heartily enjoyed the lip-smacking dish and inferred this is "the BEST Butter Chicken I have ever had"! He meant he had never even tasted anything close to this flavorful dish, even in any restaurant in India.

We couldn't help going back to Kama Sutra on the following night for dinner....and no prize for guessing - we ordered Cheese Naan & OF COURSE...... BUTTER CHICKEN!!! :)It's very clean & organized.  Funny that I haven't seen as my many employees walking the floor as I usually would at other Wal-mart stores.I love this place. Great bartenders, great service, the clientele is friendly and the drinks prices are phenomenal. What more can you ask for!!Looking to have salad for lunch is how I found this place! The photo on Yelp of their Caprese salad was tempting me, browsed through other pictures, everything looked visually appealing as well. So made the decision to have lunch here and Im very happy I did!

The food Ive tried so far rocks! Caprese Salad and their Beef Kebabs was my order.

Caprese Salad - Layered with fresh mozz, grilled eggplant and ripe tomatoes and sprinkled with basil. Loved it. The cheese was fresh, creamy and tender. Real simple salad but delish!

Beef Kebabs - There was an option for beef kebabs as a wrap or combo plate with veggies and ricel pilaf. I chose the combo of healthy proteins, starches and veggies.  Beef kebabs were nice thick chunky cuts of nicely seasoned beef that are fired grilled. It also came with a Tahini sauce that was made from scratch for dipping. Loved it! The portion sizes are average and fit the prices they charge which is moderate. Both dishes I had were under $10 each. Which is pretty affordable for the specialties they offer here.

Ambiance/Service - Delightful describes my dining experience!! It's a relaxed feel where Frank Sinatra and 40's tunes are piped in. Cherry-wood tables and chairs. Natural light filters in through the floor to ceiling windows that surround the place. Love the hand painted wall art. How sweet and thoughtful they have a little area dedicated for the little ones to dine/play too, so moms (and or dads ) can relax and unwind a bit with a glass of wine.  

It's a family owned business. The host/server that initially seated me was at the end of her shift, so Albert and Tony took over and did a great job! I also had the pleasure to meet the Chef Ash and the Bon Chef Cafe crew. All take great pride at what they do and they do it very well!  I cant wait go back to try the Baked Lobster Bisque that's topped off with a puff pastry. I know Im in for a culinary treat when I dine here!Okay, I had to re-review because they're SO GOOD. I feel almost guilty eating this food. Their portions are huge, and they give you so much of the good stuff.

Simply:
Great portions
They deliver til 4pm (What other Thai place does this?)
Their food is spice well/appropriately (they'll stop you if you're about to mess up)
They're super nice/their Customer Service is incredible.

Let me put it this way. I have never had Green Pineapple Curry, but the person I spoke to on the phone described what I was going to experience, flavor-wise, perfectly. I ordered it with Mussels, and I got SO MANY. For Seafood eaters out there: You know it's a total bummer when you get like 5 total pieces of seafood because the restaurant wants to skimp.

Also, no issues with time here. The food was ready in 20 minutes as promised. I love them for pick up/take out. 

I eat so much that I can't stop and it hurts. Yum. Yum. Yum.I decided to stop here and order the Drunken Noodle dish on a referral.  WOW!  This is like a serious hole-in-the-wall.  I wasn't sure what I was getting myself into.  Anyway, I was well attended by the staff there and they were very efficient in getting the dish into the to-go box for me....and got myself some peanut sauce on the side (A must-have for any Thai dish)

Driving back to work, my entire car had the intoxicating smell of Drunken Noodle...I knew what I was getting myself into, but not to the fullest extent until I took my first bite.

I mix the peanut sauce into the spicy drunken noodle dish...it was seriously the best thing I could have ever consumed on a Wednesday!  Oh my goodness....time decided to stop during my lunch break because every bite was so orgasmic and I began to cherish every bite I took.  Thanks Chanpen for the best Wednesday afternoon of my entire life!I got a very good first impression of Planet Fitness. I went to work out with my friend who invited me because of the unlimited guest pass deal this gym offers. There was plenty of equipment, the place was spacious, and I enjoyed the motivational wording on the walls. My friend in particular really likes the "judgement free zone" quote. All the weights and equipment seemed new and clean. Purple also happens to be my favorite color, and there is lots of it at this gym! The hydro massage tables were also nice to use after a weight lifting workout. The 10 minute session helped soothe my muscles. My friend's $20 membership gets him unlimited tanning, hydro massages, and guest passes. So much for such a small price. I wish there was one of these gyms in downtown Madison!This was our fisrt visit for dinner using a $40 Groupon.  It was located on W Sahara Ave/Ft Apache Ave in Las Vegas.  We sat at a regular table toward the back of the restaurant.  There was also a long communal high-top table with stools and a sushi bar.

We ordered 5 tapas for the 3 of us:

Hookipa Roll (Shrimp tempura, spicy tuna, avocado, cucumber, unagi sauce) was beautifully presented.  The shrimp tempura was crispy and it was NOT swimming in unagi sauce.  There were 8 bite sized pieces.

Laniki Roll (Salmon skin, kaiware, gobo, avocado, cucumber, bonito flakes, unagi sauce) was one of my personal favorites.  Not every sushi bar serves salmon skin.  The gobo was crunchy, reminiscence of the way my grandmother used to make it.  There were also 8 generous pieces and light on the unagi sauce.

Yellowtail Japapeno (Sashimi grade hamachi with a yuzu cilantro sauce) had 5 slices of hamachi on a long narrow plate.  Each slice was topped with jalapeno and cilantro on a piece of cucumber.  The jalapeno had a kick to it.

Buta Hara Sautee (Pork belly and asparagus sauteed with garlic sweet soy) would have been good served with a scoop of coconut rice.  The pork belly wasn't as crisp as I would have liked.  The portion was on the small size.  It truly was a tapas.
 
Poke Salad (Marinated tuna with white onions and avocado on a bed of spring mix in balsamic dressing) had a generous amount of cubed tuna.  The dressing was a little on the sweet side.

I liked everything we ordered and would order everything again.

We would definitely return for Happy Hour which has 1/2 price sushi on Mon-Sat 3-6pm, Fri and Sat 10pm-Midnight.Oh my gosh! Yum! Yum! Yum! Never been there until tonight with a groupon. Service was great and the  food came out quick and delicious. We ordered sushi, poke salad, fish tacos, fried tofu, and Honolulu rolls. I also liked their saki martinis (which I've never had before). We ordered some seconds. Great place and we will definitely be back. Hit the spot!Come get some of this Mexican goodness! I just finished my taco and peppers and I already can't wait to eat more. 

Note to you anal, debit card carrying people. CASH ONLY. That's how we do here in Little Mexico.

Small tacos are $1.50. Grownup size tacos are $2.50. He also cooks chimichangas, taquitos and fish tacos which are not on the menu. My boss said the fish taco was lightly battered and seasoned to perfection. She even liked it better than a taco shop that rhymes with Poopios. I had the large Carne Asada Taco which was fresh and delicious and had no grizzle and included large slices of avocado. 

The star for me is the hot sauces and the grilled peppers. I tried both sauces: RED which had a smoky hint to it and also the GREEN which tasted clean and not metallic like some do. Now to the effin peppers. He seasoned them with Lemon Pepper and I didn't pay attention to what else and then grills them. They are huge, warm, sweet and full of heat and flavor. I just want to order ten of those bad boys!  What I did was take the guts out of my taco and stuffed them in the peppers. Buh damn!

Did I mention he has his liquor license and clean, little tables set outside and a boom box? Yeah, I think I am changing my name to Hi-me and growing a stache like a true Ranchero in honor of Chuy, Three Amigos and Machete.Amazing amazing amazing!!!! Best meal so far in Vegas! We came for lunch. The American and Mexican station were my favorite with dessert close behind. The pork sliders were incredible!! Really blown away and totally worth the 77$ for both my husband and I! Yum yum yumDoes admitting to the fact that we went to this place twice in one day tell you anything? 
The Carne Asada ... blew my mind. It was a 8 oz (ish) piece of meat that was cooked to my liking. I have not had meat that tender and flavorful, maybe ever? The bartender John made a drink pairing selection, a Habanero infused Blackberry Margarita... kinda made you want to smack people!
Then the bacon wrapped shrimp on a skewer with grilled veggies.. another home run. These were big shrimp skewered with Jalapeno spears and acrispy bacon shell. This was lunch and dinner!!Cafe Rio is addictive.  Their sweet pork (marinated in Dr Pepper I hear) is some of the best I've had.  Their tortillas are fresh and taste amazing.  Their tres leaches is fantastic and I really enjoy the horchata.  

This is a much more authentic and tasty alternative to Chipotle.Fast, competent, thorough. One stop shop. Reasonably priced for the uninsured. I've been here 3 times now and our experience has been consistent. First, the waiting room is a winner...large so you're not catching what your neighbor has, and the chairs are thick and comfy. You wouldn't mind if you had a long wait because the chairs are great and there is a big screen tv there too. Never waited more than 15 minutes. Usual wait has been 5! I've been on weeknight, weekday and a Sunday night. The docs and P.A.'s treat you like you've got a brain. X-rays on site if you need them. Fast! Pharmacy too, and they give you the option to use them without pressuring you. There's a CVS right next door. We have never felt rushed during exam. When you leave, they give you the best follow up sheet I've ever seen which includes your diagnosis, what it means, what to do when to come back if necessary. It's thorough and easy to understand. This is an outstanding clinic all around. They've earned my trust and my recommendation. You won't regret working with this office.Once you've tried a burger here, you'll never want a hamburger anywhere else!I figured it was time for an update...to report on the consistently high quality of service, food, and ambiance delivered by the folks here.

My most frequent form of visit is to treat myself to an occasional work lunch, usually eaten in the bar area, and do some reading.  I have always received friendly, warm, and attentive service from the folks.  It's a really nice refreshing escape from a stressful workday....my menu/food selections vary but, some of my favorites are the Tuna Rolls, green chili, spicy peanut stew, Reuben, or the fallafal.  But, be still my beating heart...I've ignored the menu too long...and failed to notice/forgot about the meatloaf....until.....

and it was SO YUMMY on such a cold day....a very generous slab of meatloaf, first baked, then heated on the grill....a generous serving or baby red mashed potatoes, green beans, and a mountain of onion strings....who knew you could get all four food groups in such a delicious package...meat, vegetable, carbs, and deep fried :)

HUGE portion....I have left overs

hint:  If you do come in a group, at lunch time, expect to wait, especially on Thursday or Friday....come a little earlier, and consider sitting in the bar.  Also, check the upstairs bad...it's a little different but, same great menu and service!I have been here twice and had great experiences both times. My sister in laws took me here for my bday earlier this year and we had a great girls night here. Fun dishes and drinks in a cozy atmosphere and of course close to old town so plenty of bars nearby for after dinner. Second time came here just sat at the bar for drinks and they had a good selection and the bar tender was able to make some speciality drinks for usMy husband and I just got back from Italy and had some fantastic food. I feel that we are both extremely good creative cooks and are kind of food snobs with a discerning palate! WE ABSOLUTELY LOVED THIS PLACE! The ambiance! The hospitality! The waitstaff! The General manager! The food! The Prices are within reason as well. My husband has never liked escargot but I love it so we ordered it. WOW! My husband loved it. Great pastas! Fabulous wine list. We loved it so much that we made reservations for New Years Eve! Please do not look at the negative comments from people who do not know good fresh ingredients! Innovative cuisine at its best!Great crossfit location. Welcoming community, motivating trainers. Well done!
If your looking to get in shape and for a good workout, this is your place.Ordered a philly with chicken instead of steak and provolone cheese. One of the tastiest chicken phillys I've ever had. Chicken was tender and flavorful and cooked perfectly. The portion was generous as well. 

Geno's looks like some huge national chain,, but it's a small local chain owned by a few different people. I've never once been disappointed by their food or service. This location is no exception and I'm a huge fan.Hard to find. It's tucked behind solar panels on Cinnabar, it's not on El Mirage. It was pretty good overall!These guys are awesome! I'm never going to the dealership for maintenance again! After dropping over $2500 in 2 months at the BMW dealership for various things to be fixed on my 335xi (Left Rear window regulator $580, 2 tires $500, Right Rear window regulator $580, AC $400, diagnostic blah blah blah) they wanted another $900 to replacement front brakes. I took my car into Southwest Bimmers after reading about them on BMW forums online. Dave replaced my brakes for a little more than half that and then replaced my fuel sensor. Originally he thought he'd also need to replace the fuel pump, but after replacing the sensor, decided it wasn't needed (saving me $500!!). These guys are great - very knowledgable, spent a lot of time answering my questions and updating me on the progress of my vehicle.

I know I'm gushing, but I can't over-emphasize how much better my customer experience was in dealing with Southwest Bimmers over the BMW dealership! And they saved me a ton. I also got an oil change for $75 versus over $200 at the dealership (same oil and filter as the dealership)! They will not only be doing all of my future maintenance, but will be installing all of my future mods as well. 

If you're sick of paying exorbitant fees just because you bought a BMW,  take your car here. They do all the same certified work, use all of the OEM parts, provide excellent personal customer service, and save you a ton of money!Free arcade games. Yes please! Games are older but those are the best ones I think . I really liked the pinball machine and wish they had another one. They have a pretty good selection of draft beer and $2 fireball shots on happy hour. Our server was friendly and enjoyable. The food was nothing to write home about but not bad. I like the small patio outside. Perfect for nice weatherIt took me about 18 months of living in Arizona to stumble on this and it was by pure accident.  This place is DELICIOUS!  Think of a chipotle/subway-esque place but for Italian food.  You can choose between an Italian-style "burrito" (the Pellini), pasta bowl, or salad.  I got the pasta bowl and not only was it amazingly good, there was enough for two meals so I got to enjoy it all over again the next day.  Everything was fresh and tasty and I can't say anything bad about this place.  So many different options for an extremely reasonable price.  You decide between the three styles and then choose your meats, sauce, and extras.  Once my b/f and I move to Scottsdale, we'll be making many more trips here and I raved about it to several of my friends to try out :)  They had already beaten me to the punch and I was upset they hadn't told me about this place earlier!!If I lived closer, I would be here everyday! The crepes are spectacular! Best in town I believe and I've been to quite a few places.  The single serve cakes are also delicious but when ordering a bigger version, it will cost you quite a bit. Everyone here is very friendly and the small sitting area is always clean. One of my favorite places for sure.One of the better deli's around!  Food is fresh, employees are very nice (even when busy), and best of all, the food is great!  I highly recommend this place to everyone in the area for lunch!  WAY better than fast food!!!Amazing and professional i have eaten all over The  world and this place kicks ass for The money try the spicy burro and fish tacos!This may be my new favorite airport simply because of this cafe. I didn't think I would find both vegan and gluten free options at an airport but this place has it all. The food was delicious, reasonable prices, great service and so many options. It was such a blessing to be able to sit down and enjoy a nice, hot meal. 

I had the Zuni burrito (no egg, no tortilla). It had tofu, potatoes, spinach and mushrooms. It was hot and scrumptious and only $7.75. I also decided to try the Spicy Chickpea Lettuce Wrap which had two pretty big sized lettuce wraps topped with mashed garbanzo beans made with olive oil, red onions, celery, red bell pepper, cayenne pepper and paprika. It was all topped with fresh avocado and sundries tomatoes. It was only $7.50. 

I also loved that this place had lots of sit down seating. You just get in line to order, then they call your name. There were several lines with different options. There was a pizza station (with vegan and gluten free pizza!), a sandwich/ salad line, breakfast food/burgers and this place even had a coffee bar with specialty drinks and baked goods (I didn't see vegan/ gluten free baked goods). I will definitely try to get more layovers at this airport so that I can eat here again. :)I've been to this place several times with and without my daughter. The staff is always friendly and one time a few weeks ago when we were dining right before closing and I got a free slice of cheese! So nice!  The pizza itself is amazingly delicious.The guys at Green Savvy made the process of getting my MMJ card quick and easy. Give them a call. They will guide you and make the process easier than you could imagine. If you dont have recent medical records, they will refer you to a friendly specialist. All for a minimal cost. 
G.S. is friendly, helpful, discrete and made the process quick and easy. I would recommend them to anyone. Call Sam and tell him Al sent you.Multiple wonderful experiences with Rob from Weapons Training Fundamentals! I had a few personal training sessions with Rob to improve my accuracy with my handgun as well as to gain comfort using a shot gun and other large weapons. 

I found that some local ranges treated me inappropriately because I am a female and came in with many questions. Rob was extremely professional and eagerly answered every question I had in great detail. I never felt embarrassed asking any question I had. 

I was so impressed with the professionalism, knowledge and training skill Rob had, I hired him to come into my home and do CCW instruction for me and my dad. There is nothing like learning details of self defense in the comfort of your own living room. Rob was even comfortable dealing with my very large dog and didn't mind when she drooled on his computer. 

After discussing my CCW experience with friends who have taken the class through other companies, I feel my training was in greater depth and covered details other instructors omit. I feel Rob is genuinely concerned with my personal safety and is passionate to help educate. 

I recommend Weapons Training Fundamentals without hesitation and am looking forward to further improving my firearm skills with Rob. I will use them for all my future firearm education and instruction needs.Wonderful! I stopped in before it officially opened and all the managers were excited, friendly and gave me coupons and free samples. The equipment is brand new and the place is meticulously clean inside. They gave me a custom bag with my name on it for future drop offs. There is something about getting my clothes cleaned with brand new machinery that makes me feel good. I have nothing but positive things to say about the employees, managers and guest service. Not sure what Kathy M is talking about! I have been multiple times and they are consistently excellent! Perhaps she owns another dry cleaning business! 

Easy to drop off clothes on your way to Starbucks in the morning.There is a 24 hour drop off too if you come after business hours. Give them a try!From the service to drinks to food to atmosphere.....all around excellence. This is the Cadillac of Mexican restaurants.Ate here on 22 December 2013.

The food isn't mind blowing but is way better than your typical Mexican fare.

The margaritas here are the best I've ever tasted. Hands down. Try em all!

The server was very professional and had a great sense of timing for when he was needed and when he wasn't.

This is a great place to enjoy both a casual meal and a nice dinner in the evening.I live in Seattle, so I've been purchasing from Pink Spot online-only. I won't be buying from any other vendor. Why? I'll tell you.

1. The juices! Tasty, tasty juices. The most rich, balanced, and flavorful of all the juices I've tried. These aren't one-note at all. Layers of flavor that liven the palate. They include a sample juice of your choice with every order, so I've had the chance to try out different flavors each time... found a few I didn't like (so I didn't have to waste money buying them) and a few I love (so I know it's worthwhile to buy them).

2. The customer service! The awesome, friendly customer service. Penn and Sandi are great to do business with. They write handwritten notes on their invoices. They are clearly very knowledgable, answering all of my questions quickly and accurately.

I can't recommend PSV highly enough. Love you guys!!Always friendly service and fresh food. Check out their secret menu, http://www.in-n-out.com/menu/not-so-secret-menu.aspx
 The animal style fries and burgers are the best ("Animal Style. An Animal Style burger also includes extra Thousand Island spread, mustard grilled patties, and extra pickles. Animal Style fries, on the other hand, are topped with cheese, spread, and grilled onions.") ! This place is always busy.You can even order a root beer float.Had a Groupon for the $22 blow-out and went in on Sunday & had a fabulous experience. As soon as I walked in I was greeted warmly and immediately offered a beverage.  The salon is well decorated and very clean.  They had "Some Like It Hot" playing on the TV which was great to watch while getting my blow-out; one of my fave movies.  My stylist Megan was great and very friendly.  Everyone in this place always had a smile on.  My hair felt 10lbs lighter afterwards and it was so soft!  I will definitely be back and am considering becoming a member.  So happy I found this place!As a Las Vegas local, I have seen a LOT of hypnosis shows, and I expected this one to be more or less the same. 

Boy was I wrong...it wasn't the same, it was BETTER! 

Kevin's self-deprecating humor and genuine sense of fun set the tone for this show. Even as an audience member, I felt like I was part of it. :) He treated the participants with respect  (something one does not always see in a hypnosis comedy show), and I left the show feeling that, after all, one CAN find variety and originality in Vegas.

Kevin's show wasn't "just another hypnosis show". It is the only hypnosis show I would ever recommend to my friends and family, both in and out of Vegas.  Fun!We took our family recently to Honey Salt for lunch.  The food is outstanding, as well as the service.  The desserts are indescribably delicious!

We can't wait to return to this restaurant.

Marietta HenryAwesomesauce as they say.  Flavor adventures on a whole new level.  Creative recipes with old style tricks.  Add a great staff and awesome drinks to the mix.   

 If you enjoy food, this is a must go for at least one time.  Chances are you'll be back for more.Great sisters! Love how they treat hair and their customers. Best hair cut so far. Love the name of the place too!I'm pretty picky about my hair and my stylist. I want a stylist who can both listen and make suggestions. If they can't do that in a way that gives me a consistent cut, I move on. Candace at Foxtail 'gets' my hair. She asks questions to be sure she's doing what I want and I don't have to offer much direction of my own. She makes sure I'm satisfied before I leave. I love both the color and the style, plus she and her sister, Jude, the two owner-operators, make each visit fun. They are both easy to relate to and joke around with, so I feel totally comfortable in their company. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend them to friends and family. Park in the building's garage and they will validate your ticket to cover the first hour of parking.In Las Vegas, there hasn't been many ice cream places that I would consider going back to.

That is, until I stepped into The Perfect Scoop. From the outside it looks kind of tacky with that big smiley face but the product and the person who works inside makes it a place that I LOVE coming to.

Let's start with the basics -- The Ice Cream. The ice cream here is one of the best I've had. I'm not a fancy pants connoisseur of Ice Cream, but I know what I like and don't like -- and I definitely like what's going on here. It's sweet but not too sweet -- just how I like it. Plus, what place can you find in the South West side that's going to give you flavors like Taro, Black Sesame, or Pink Guava?

But the more important part is that the man who's behind the counter makes going there completely worth it. He may be a little slow to serve you, but that's because all of his effort is going into anything he's touching. There's a difference between ignoring a customer and making sure everyone gets the attention they deserve in the order that they came in.

All in all, five stars in my book. If you've been to LA's Little Tokyo's shopping market, there's a small ice cream shoppe that used to be my favorite place to stop at when I visited. I think I may have found someplace much closer to replace it (:Love this place!Great menu, fast, and delicious! Perfect for wanting something quick and cheap! Will definitely return!**CLOSED**

Wish I ate here more!!! 

This place has one of the city's best burgers and poutine (fries, gravy and cheese) 

I had the Rattlecan Burger cooked medium rare to perfection with an egg! 

For all you Fatburger lovers out there...if thats good..this is great! 

I would eat here once a week if I could and tell all my friends about it!

***** I ATE HERE MARCH 4th....HEARD THEY DID NOT OPEN AGAIN ON MARCH 5th! **** CLOSED!First time here! I walked right in. It was so simple. I can't wait to go back regularly since I needed anew chiropractor.Downtown has definitely changed since I moved here ten years ago!  If you haven't been lately, you need to go, and don't miss Commomwealth!  Beautiful place with a great rooftop patio.  My friends and I really enjoyed it.Finally a Thai restaurant in Surprise, Az! We came the day this restaurant opened, and went back the next day as well. Great authentic Thai food, friendly atmosphere, can't go wrong plus they deliver within a 3 mile radius!Gertrude's, at the Desert Botanical Gardens, is a wonderful restaurant, set amid the beautiful desert scenery.  It is located next to the gift shop, near the entrance.  Me and a friend visited Gertrude's on Monday night, while at the gardens to see the new Chihuly sculptures.  The food was fantastic.  Our waitress was wonderful.  We split a bottle of red wine ($30), and each ordered the Green Chile Pork stew ($11).  We split the Salmon salad ($18), and also split the Tequila Citrus Cheesecake ($8).  The prices are mid-range - not too expensive, but not cheap, either.  The food was all very fresh and delicious.  I plan to make Gertrude's a regular stop on my visit to the Gardens.  We had a wonderful time exploring the gardens to see the magnificent Chihuly sculptures - Gertrude's was part of that wonderful experience.Went to Gertrude's, again, to try the new Gertrude's Burger!!!! ... As expected, DELICIOUS!!! I definately recommend having this burger...oh my! Never dissapointed in the service...very attentive staff, and ofcourse the atmosphere is pretty relaxing too!! Will be back to try more of the new menu...wish my tummy was bigger...LOL...I would try it all in one sitting... :)I've been coming here since I lived in New Mexico and would come out to Phx for a quick vacay. (About 3 yrs.) Once I moved here I tried a different place by my apt. which didn't even compare to the quality, price, and customer service you receive at AZ Airbrush Studio. Very quick and easy natural looking tan. You never have to worry about looking dirty or like a oompa loompa at this place! Check deals on living social, groupon, yelp etc. And sign up for e-mail notifications to receive awesome deals!Thank goodness. A clean, bright space with fresh and fabulous breakfast options, great service, no rush. Pay attention LGO... A run for your money in your 'hood. Thanks JC; perfect service. We'll definitely be back.Recently, my bridal party and I had our hair & make-up done at Vanity.  We had the whole place to ourselves.  They were very friendly and professional.  They even took pictures for us.  We had a great experience there!  Even the flower girl had a great time.  If your party books there, the bride will get free hair and make-up done.First time here and was pleasantly surprised. Showed up at 8am and they got me right in. Reception was welcoming, nurse listened to me, doc spent a good amount of time with me, Rx filled onsite. Great experience. Doc was Todd Radivan.Me and my friend took a helicopter tour, and we were very impressed! The pilot was very nice, and professional, we bought a package for a helicopter tour of the vegas strip, and the pilot took us over the strip and then also took us for a tour of red rock canyon also so our 15 minute tour turned into a 45 minute one for free. I was very impressed with my expierence I highly recommend 702!!!I love this place. After eating at cherry blossom we walked over to get a dessert. I love their taro milk tea boba. And also their green tea Snoh w mocchi, peach and caramel. It has less calories but not minus the flavor. The concept is very unique and I love this placeI recently found this restaurant when I was having a hankering for some good spaghetti and meatballs. I work in East Mesa and am not terribly familiar with mom & pop places nearby. I was blown away by how good this to-go order was! The pasta was al dente and the sauce was absolutely delicious. It also came with a generous portion of bread and a salad, all for a very reasonable price... about $10. 

My next trip was only a week later (today) when I ordered the prosciutto and arugula panini. This sandwich is to die for! If you're a fan of this salty meat, you will not find a better one around. It is topped with provolone cheese, roasted red peppers, arugula, and a red wine vinegarette. I also received a side of potato chips which taste and appear to be homemade. Total came to $9.29 after tax.

There are many other items on the menu I would like to try. While some items are more expensive than others, keep in mind there is a lunch specials menu to choose from. 

This will definitely be a new go-to place for me!How "Grimaldis" gets more stars than this place makes about as much sense as the federal budget.  Excellent tasting food. Excellent service.  Excellent atmosphere.  Drinks were excellent. Presentation excellent.Lived in Italy for years and this place is legit.  Eat it there if you can but to go works if you must.  They have solid Chiantis and Peroni as well for the full experience.  Lickedty split service too--pizza is done in 90 seconds!  Min ingredients so you don't feel like a bloated food preserver.  All in all it's the best pizza I've had in Vegas and top 5 in the states.  2 Amy's in DC is still tops in my book.My wife and I have eaten at Novecento on multiple occasions and have been very happy with our experience each time. Chef Marc's "Parma" restaurant is a favorite of ours and we made his Wednesday night pizza service a regular event, so we were thrilled when Novecento opened. 

  We are big fans of the standard Margarita Pizza and Novecento does them quite well. The crusts are always nicely charred with that great "leopard spot" that lets you know the oven did its thing. The sauce is sweet and applied as to not make the pie soggy because there is nothing worse than limp crust. The fresh basil and buffalo mozzarella complete a wonderful package. 

  I've never been big on cannolis but the ones Novecento serves will turn a non-believer like me into a cannoli convert. Light, crisp pastry tube filled with creamy whipped mascarpone cheese and a generous amount of chocolate chips that will put a smile on your face. A glass of house red wine at $3 a glass is a perfect complement to both dinner and dessert. 

  The ordering process at Novecento was a bit cumbersome when they first opened but that has been streamlined and the process goes quite quickly now. The lack of table service helps keep the prices down and makes this spot a great value. The lack of wait staff doesn't mean that Novecento is like other short-order sit down type places. The restaurant is more upscale than most all other places in its price range. The atmosphere is comfortable and makes you want to take your time and savor your meal.

  If you like great Napoletana style pizza, give Novecento a try. I bet you won't be disappointed.Really great service . The staff was friendly a quick ! I would recommend anyone to come support their business!Best inexpensive Seafood in this part of town. Found it by using the nearby button on my phone and came here that same day. Located in a large strip mall right on the corner. Look for a place with a banner and several colorful posters of the food specials in each window.

They have Fish, Oysters, Shrimp, Chicken, Burgers, Philly Cheese Steaks and more. You can even order a Salad and load it up with with some of the proteins mentioned above. They also have several fried appetizers as well as some really good side dishes. The Coleslaw is really good and taste like my recipe. Great value and large portions.

Really like the Catfish and Shrimp. You can get them fried or grilled. The fried Oyster plate is also very tasty and a favorite of mine. You definitely have to try the Catfish, Shrimp or Oyster Po-Boys. Reminds me of what we used to get when we would stop at these tiny roadside shacks while traveling along the gulf coast in LA and MS.

Service is extremely friendly and you will see very quickly as you enter the restaurant. This also has to be one of the cleanest restaurants I have seen in a long time. It is nice to know they care about the customers and a big reason for my high rating. ENJOY!

5 STARSI'll admit, I was super skeptical about trying a massage place that charges $20  per hour, but I was more  than pleasantly surprised.

The ambiance is different...and the outside is misleading. Once you're inside, it's dark and quiet and relaxing. The LED trees are a nice touch. 

The massage itself was wonderful. It reminded me a lot of massages I got in Thailand...not necessarily the kind of massage you'd get at a higher end spa, but great and relaxing never the less.

I love that they offer green tea or water after, and they don't rush you out the door. I'll be back, and I highly recommend it to anyone who's up for trying something different than a massage chain experience.People rave about Voodoo donut in Portland, now Vegas has something to rave about! I actually think that Pink Box is better than Voodoo. Voodoo takes good donuts and puts interesting toppings on them, Pink Box takes good donuts and puts interesting things on and IN them! I am fortunate enough to live right down the street so I've tried quite a few things. I also routinely pick up a dozen on my way to work, just give me a reason to bring them in! Here are a few of my favorites:

Fritters! They have apple and cherry! The cherry are SO good, but I've only seen them a couple of times. 

Key Lime Pie - This delicious morsel has homemade whipped cream on top and is filled with the limiest of lime fillings. SO good!

Lemon filled - This glazed beauty has lemony goodness stuffed inside. If you are a fan of lemon, this is the donut for you.

S'mores - Brulee'd marshmallow cream is on top of this chocolate covered marshmallow cream filled little cloud. 

Cheesecake - Chocolate covered and filled with delicious cream cheese cheesecake filling.

Now, get out of your house and go...seriously GO...I'll wait...

You can thank me later!Ladies and Gentlemen we have a winner!

The Hines' have awarded the Gordon Ramsay BurGR the winner of the best burger challenge. Yes, it's not in Southern California, but this burger has me wanting to jump on a plane at midnight for a juicy bite. 

The jalapeno poppers were delish and the surprise* popper added excitement to our evening.
*one jalapeno still has the seeds inside adding some mystery and  heat to dish

To be fair in our process we ordered a beef burger, cheese, grilled onions, lettuce and tomato, although the other burger options were very tempting! The burger arrived hot, and smelling amazing. The meat was cooked perfectly and when cut in half was just barely manageable to get my mouth around for a bite. Each bite was every so tasty and not one ounce of grease dripped down my arm. The bun is great and you don't end up with no meat and all bun at the end. The Just Fries were more then enough for us to split and were overshadowed by the tasty burger, but from what I remember tasted pretty good as well.

Yes, the burgers are expensive, but 1, it's Vegas and 2, it's Gordon Ramsay.

*Not sure they take reservations, but if they do, I STRONGLY suggest making one, otherwise look at a 1hr wait, minimum. I wanted to stand out front after we were done telling people the wait was worth it.
But hey, if you have a wait, wander around the Miracle Mile of Shops :)I am upgrading this to 5 stars are it has gotten even better since it opened.  The staff is on top of everything.  

The food is good, albeit not as authentic as I would like, but still good nonetheless.  

Only complaint is that the sopapillas have too much cinnamon sugar.  The cinnamon sugar should be an option, as I would prefer them plain.So far, the best part of my traveling day! Valet parking is included, so I just drove up to the front door and someone unloaded my luggage for me and parked my car. I walk into the lobby to register and there is NO line to register! The clerk was as nice as can be, answered all my questions without seeming put upon, explained my package (more on that later) and reminded me that the bottled water in the room frig was FREE, can you believe it, FREE? And they have some great packages. Mine was $75 a day which included breakfast each morning as well as a $25 pool credit, drinks or lunch at the pool. I had to look pretty hard to find this package but it was there, offered by the hotel on their website. I really like Las Vegas. But I don't like the long lines to register and the worn out rooms in the hotels on the Strip. I have a new hotel when I come here. The room is beautiful, a King bed with quality linens. Two comfortable chairs and a small lounge area. I rode the elevator up with the housekeeper for the floor and as we got off the elevator she said to me, "Welcome the the Aliante. If you need anything, please call me and I will get it to you!" OMG! OMG! After the fiasco at Fox Car Rentals I feel like I have arrived in paradise.First, if you have read the bad reviews, MAKE SURE to read the owner, Shawna's, responses. Now, for all you yelpers out there that believe in "if it sounds to good to be true, there must be something wrong", well NOT with this place. ALL the girls are super friendly. The owner and her sister Ashley are the most sweetest people on the planet. Yeah sure we ALL have our off days, but these girls don't let their clients know if they are or are not having an off day. Rachel is the gal I have been going to since February and every time she does an AWESOME job. I would recommend anyone of those girls to ALL my friends including my guy friends.

So again, if you think it's too good to be true, you are WAY WRONG. These other comments about the owner parking in the handicap parking, or waiting until after your sixth time coming back to write a bad review, or the prices being two high for your services when you didn't actual pay that price; they all are wrong. Again, If you read these comments take the time to read the owner, Shawna's, response.This was my first time at this location and I was very impressed.  The interior is warm and inviting, very clean and modern.  There are tables outside and yes they play music outside as well.  Now for the important part, the coffee was excellent and the customer service outstanding.  Thank you Charles and Jessica for making us feel welcome even though we arrived close to closing time.The best food ever and the ambiance was AWESOME.Heading back to Bar Soba again! Loving this pub just now. Drinks are very reasonably priced & looking forward to sampling the food for the first time.Um yeah....I DREAM about this place! Love the beer, especially the Lady Luck.  The food is amazing! The grilled cheese sandwich and the summer sausage sandwich are out of this world. Most of the food is local, with meats coming from Underground Butcher. The staff is super friendly and I love the outdoor patio.I was there on Saturday and owner D'Lisa waxed my eyebrows, and Sabrina gave me a mani-pedi.  The service there was awesome.  I am in love with the gel/foil nails, and the pedicure was great.  Everyone was so friendly and stopped by to say hi or to see how my nails were coming along.  There were so many colors and foil designs to choose from.  I made a hair appointment with Sabrina for later in the week as well.  D'Lisa's waxing was so quick and painless.  I was really pleased with my whole experience and can't wait to go back!Decided to get my wife's 2008 Honda CRV detailed for her as a surprise. It hadn't been washed in about 3 months due to the cold weather and I can't remember the last time we put a coat of wax on it.   Dropped it off  at about 8:00AM in the morning & went back & picked it up about 2:00PM.  They did a SUPERB JOB !  It looked way better than the day she bought it new !  This is a small operation so they take their time & pride themselves on their work.  Paid a little extra and they detailed the engine compartment.  Under the hood looked as good as the car !  I will be going back & recommending this to anyone looking for a good auto detailing place to do their car.

Henderson,  NVWas taken to this little hidden treasure by a group of friends and was pleasantly surprised.  Their menu options were all very tempting but I have to rave about the brisket sandwich that I ordered.  All of the ingredients were very fresh and flavorful.  If you are looking for some great food in a laid back atmosphere, I definitely recommend stopping in here.Well I have been to this restaurant 4 different times and have tried something different each time and decided that this restaurant deserved a review. Every meal I have eaten here has been absolutely delicious!! My first visit, on a recomendation from a friend, I had their brisket sandwich, honestly one of the best sandwiches i have ever eaten. Perfect fries and a nice little concoction of baby pickles, spices and vinegar. I have also tired a couple different burgers, both juicy and tasty and just had the grilled chicken club, moist and delicious. I have now brought my wife and friends here. It is not close to where I live but damned if I don't love the drive knowing how good their food is. 

It is a small qauint little place that serves breakfast and lunch for now, and I believe you can byob. It is accross the street from the hospital and is usually busy but well worth the effort. Thank me once you have tried it!!Fantastic! The food, service & restaurant itself !
Our server John was the best, he knew the dishes inside and out.
Cocktails were perfect !Great as always! They remember what we get, i love this place , the owners are  always there with a smile and ready to  satisfy your sweet tooth wither is a crepe we choose or their delicious sticky rice with mango or just a fruit salad it's the freshest you can get. Just a great lunch or the best way to end your day Tasty Crepes is bomb awesome.Awesome. Wife and kids; kids played table tennis in the yard and we relaxed and enjoyed the great beer selection. Food and service excellent. Cannot wait to returns sans kids and have some fun with friends..... Highly recommend.Last year we moved to a home that didn't have a pool.  I went out and received numerous pool estimates along with hardscape estimates.  Being that I never had a pool installed I was at a loss for what the pricing might look like.  I went to most of the big pool companies. (California Pools, Presidential Pools, Caribbean Pools)  To my surprise they were all so expensive and didn't have the time to really sit down with me and understand what I wanted.  We ended up going with The Edge Remodeling.  Randy came out, listened to what we wanted and had plans drawn up to share with us.  We made some modifications and then signed the final contract.  Construction began within a few days of us signing.  Randy took the lead from the beginning and kept me informed through every step of the process.  I received emails, text messages and personal visits almost daily to keep me informed of what was going on.  I work from home and I watched the pool construction on a daily basis.  The workers really knew what they were doing and took pride in their work.  Prior to the start of the project my yard was a disaster.  I'm so proud of what it looks like now.  We have many friends and have people over all the time.  It's so nice to hear them comment on how nice it looks.  It really makes us feel good and know that we made the right decision on selecting The Edge Remodeling for our pool construction and hardscape.  Construction was completed on schedule and now we are able to enjoy our new custom pool and yard.  I would definitely use The Edge Remodeling for future projects I may have.I cannot stop thinking about the Al Pastor and the Elote (Mexican Corn) !!!

Hands down best Mexican food I've had so far! And so close to home!!! 

Their menu is huge!
You get to choose if you want burritos, tacos, nachos, fries, bowls.. Then they have 12 kinds of meat to choose from and they have veggie toppings, ie soyrizo (soy chorizo).. Variety of toppings.. And a big side and sauces bar.. I mean can you ask for more?!

I had the Al Pastor nachos with an Elote.
The meat was tender, toppings (guacamole, sour cream, pinto beans, cheese) were fresh and homemade, and the nachos were crisp!
Meat to toppings to chips ratio was good!

I know it's just corn but their Elote was sooooo good !!! I don't know how such a simple thing can pack so much flavor!! 

I wish I would've gone for the $2 tacos to try different meats like the carne asada or carnitas .. but now this only means I HAVE to go back!!!We decided to try this restaurant after reading the yelp reviews. We went for the early "happy hour". Yelp comes through again!! We had a great meal - not only very tasty - but very unique dishes. To me is seemed like a cross between upscale Japanese food and tapas. We had small dishes that we shared, but got to taste a great variety of dishes. The waiter was efficient and very personable. The manager checked in with us to see if we were enjoying our meal, and seemed to truly want our feedback. It was a very enjoyable evening. The only comment we had other than totally positive was that my husband missed having rice with his dinner. We will definitely go back the next time we are in Vegas, and would recommend it to anyone we knew was going there.So after having taking about a year off from going to fun new places due to my new fabulous baby , I had been wanting to check this place out for MONTHS. Finally I made it in with a few of my girlfriends (the hubs was a little annoyed to miss out, sorry guy!)

First - this place isn't huge. The staff is super accommodating and tries to make it work, but just know that if you have a large group or if you are heading over during a busy time, you may have to wait. 

I had heard that during the day there is a butcher shop inside, and while we sat & talked I took a peek at that menu. I am planning on heading over this weekend to pick up some steaks to grill at home - it all looked delicious.

We all split a bottle of Pinot Noir, and ordered a bunch of items to share. The guac appetizer is delish, and we shared the mushroom quesadilla which surprised me with how good it was. I'm normally not a fan of quesadillas, so I'm always happy to be proven wrong.

We ordered the pork sandwich (I don't remember the name) and HOLY CRAP it was incredible! I had a hard time sharing and felt guilty that the hubs wasn't there to try it. 

We'll definitely be back. Loved all the food and the friendly atmosphere.Italian beef dipped with hot peppers....amazing! I could almost eat it everyday. Got to have my fix at least once a week. Hot dogs are awesome too.What an amazing evening! Huge thank you to Jeremy and Vegas Party VIP for a stellar evening! Beecher's Madhouse was everything we wanted and more! Guest list for seven girls, bottle service and an amazing booth location! Couldn't ask for better service! Will definitely be using this service again!I loved this place when it was at the old location in front of Imperial Palace and I just checked it out yesterday and still love it. The location inside of the Venetian isn't the greatest, but the venue itself if pretty cool. Awesome pool tables and beer pong tables and so many TV's plus a mechanical bull... aaaaaand a cage you can hang from (see photo.) We all ordered the tacos and they were pretty damn good. You can pay $50 for open bar all day. They also have buy 1 get 1 happy hour well drinks. Mechanical bull is free to ride  for women and $5 for guys. We had a very good time even though it was kind of dead for a Sunday afternoon. Hopefully they promote it a little better to get more people in... Even if they don't I'll be back!This is by far the most edible burger in the Tatum/Shea area.  The fries are great, but one thing stands out:  the people are happy and nice!!!  Nice burger people, how's that for an oxymoron ;). Oh and they have Coca Cola's freestyle machine too (infinite soda mixtures).  BTW I think the people that gave this place one or two stars were eating in an alternate universe.I've tried every bar downtown's food so saying Mingo's is my number 1 means more than fluffy words!  EXCELLENT tapas style (labeled as Big Plates and Small Plates) bar food that's more upscale than most such as rib-eye and my favorite- the brussell sprouts!  The menu also has new stuff as the chef feels inspired.

Décor is also a winning factor since it strikes the perfect balance between a crisp modern palette and comfortable, homey touches.  There's even purse hooks and chargers at every bar stool!    

Finally I have to shout out the reason I ever heard of this place-  Ona who bartends every Tuesday with an event specializing in underground dance songs curated by her called Onnaland :).  Of course it's my #1 night to visit for an adorably hashtagged libation and nosh but EVERYONE there from the owner (Mingo) on down is friendly, FAST and fun so you can't not have a good time!

Add Mingo's for sure to your downtown spots and tag it #eatmixmingoIf you like New York style pizza this place is a hidden gem in Downtown...Located across from the court house on Lewis & Casino Center, they are one of the best I have found in town.

They are open Monday through Friday only from 7am to 6pm, but if you can make it downtown during the week, this is a place to check out.  Parking is a bit of a challenge as there is no free public parking lot, but I tell you it is worth the trip.

They have lunch special's which run daily until 4pm which means 2 large cheese slices with a drink is only $5.50 until 4pm.

Everyone I have talked to during my visit today has told me everything they have is excellent.  You won't find a bad item on the menu and Anthony is a very cool person to hang and chat with.  

I highly recommend this place, you won't be disappointed...Great coffee shop. I usually get a Caffè Americano which is always good. Perfect atmosphere, I'm looking forward to using the patio when the weather gets better!After a crazy day I wanted something healthy and drive thru (I have a very sick little one that I didn't want to take in and out of anywhere). A friend had posted about this place on FB so I figured we'd try it. Yum! I got the Santa Fe wrap and the dressing was awesome! The wrap was huge as well. The kids got the butter salad and the turkey pinewheels, both with apples and peanut butter and both enjoyed their food. I wish there was one closer but we will definitely be back!This place is the "hidden gem" of Vegas! We got the couples massage with the Yelp discount... $90 for both of us for 50 minutes!  Really can't beat that. With all the other over priced spas out there, I'm glad there is one out there that won't brake the bank. Such a great massage! We will be back!Had our gender ultrasound today and was very pleased. The place is beautiful. Lots of places to sit, play area for your kids. The receptionist and tech were very nice. The tech took her time, got lots of great shots and actually seemed into her job. Found out gender at 14 weeks! We will be back later on for chubby baby 3D pics of our baby BOY! LOLStacey is the best! She really knows her business and is very friendly. Made me feel very comfortable and is very professional. I'll go back for sure..I stayed there with my wife and two kids in 2010. It was super fun. The pool is the best, the room is super modern and comfortable. Everywhere you look reminds you of rock, fun, good times. The staff is super friendly. The only think I can not review is the casino, because I wasn't allowed to go there with the kids.One of the best breakfast restaurants I have eaten in.  We were staying at a hotel about 20 min away but had to try this place based on the high yelp ratings it had. i am glad we did.  The orange juice is freshly squeezed right in plain view and you get free refills. Locally baked bread and jams are delicious. Love the take on trying to provide healthy products like organic milk and cage free eggs. I had the 5 egg white scramble and it was delicious!!!Hands down the best group of lounges in the U.S. and far superior to the Club lounges available at Vegas. 

Centurion and Platinum gets you in free.

The food services are exceptional and the children's play room has everything a family would need. 

Clean restrooms and showers for long layovers are an added
bonus. 

Although it's located in D you can access it even from A B C by walking to D security and an attendant will let you cross over to D by showing your boarding pass. It's worth the 7 minute walk from the Southwest gates.I followed Ashley, Courtney and Bri from Sahara and haven't regretted it ever. The place is fun to walk into, check out the all natural supplies. I love the beaver, its great Bri has a sense of humor. Sophisticated, quirky, elegant. A fantastic place to get your "have to do this" stuff done.
Box is a perfect place to decompress for a bit before heading back into the fray.Best Boutique Waxing Service in town. New location is a lot further from me, but the incredible services are well worth the drive. Brazilian waxing is taken very seriously and isn't rushed thru like other waxing spas. HIGHLY RECOMMEND for bikini season!Eladio is awesome, I have had quite a few things done at his shop and you know he is great because every time he is booked solid with repeat business. He is great at finding things other mechanocs cant and is very knowledgeable when it comes to performance and upgrades.  Very good prices and the most honest and streight forward guy you can meet.I absolutely love this restaurant. The owners are truly great people. The location is perfect. Near all the action and easy to get to. The food is always fresh and delicious.One of the town's best little secret,  the ribs are too die for. The meat just melts off the bones. HeavenWe attending the opening of Oz The Great and Powerful (3D) for the 7 pm show on March 8. I took out the camera and took photos as we went. What a wonderful experience! The theater looked posh and "Like a Hollywood opening" (as my hubby said) and the experience was great from the git go. We ordered tickets online and got reserved seating, which was really convenient; there was free popcorn and then there were the seats! All the folks around us agreed that there was nothing like reclining on a more comfortable chair than we had at home to watch a movie! The movie itself was excellent, too, with just 10 minutes of trailer and then boom! on with the 3D glasses and on with the show! And what a show it was! Magical doesn't even begin to describe the experience with this level of 3D and sound. The screen was a full wall and something else to see. The manager (who introduced the movie) and ushers were great - friendly, accommodating and happy to help. We will definitely go to this cinema again, especially since we live just across the street! 4 thumbs up from us.We have seen two matinees at Galaxy Green Valley; Jurassic Park 3D (Dino-fun!) and Olympus Has Fallen (surpassed my very low expectations).  The only reason I agreed to go see OHF was because I LOVE this theatre!  We took two out-of-towners with us after talking the theatre up, and it did not disappoint.   For the same price (!!) as your every day run of the mill movie house, you get comfy recliners with plenty of space around you and no one kicking your chair.  We were in theatre 6 today and the screen was awesome.  Totally encompassing,  The boys had popcorn, beer and a cider.  Beer and Cider?  Yep....  The gourmet hot dogs we saw others eating looked pretty tasty as well.  Maybe next time, and there will be plenty of next times.  Hopefully, my Galaxy Rewards Card will earn us some free stuff!You know when you leave a movie theater after a long movie and sometimes feel sore and your neck is cramped? I felt like I just sat on a stone slab and watched a movie. Well, head over to Galaxy for their FULLY reclining leather chairs, AWESOME. Even sitting in row B which was 2nd to the front, you can still recline and have a great view of the screen. 

On top of all of this - BEER & WINE - Yes, you can get a 32oz beer ($9), they have a decent selection on tap as well. Some of the brew comes from the Barley's brewery a few buildings down. Grab a beer, head to your theater, lay back in that awesome chair, and enjoy your movie!!By far my most favorite theater I have ever been to. It's was great enjoying a movie having some popcorn and drinking some beer, what a wonferful combination!

The seat were unbelievably comfortable, its more comfy watching a movie here then it is at home. 

I think I may even have to find movie I wouldn't normally watch just to come relax here.

Great job Galaxy Theater!!!This is one of the best sushi bars in Phoenix. Very fresh Sushi and their prices are very reasonable. The sushi staff and servers are great.This is the best Barber Shop I've been to in decades. Eddie is a damn maestro, I'm tellin' ya. Just finished my first visit and I'm sold for life. It's the real deal. I'm not a 5 Star poster, usually, but this place is worthy.I haven't had my appointment yet, but I'm already won over. They're so honest here. I was ready to spend $200+ for color stripping and re-dye and their colorist told me not only not to do it buy that he liked what I had going on. I appreciated the honesty! Will for sure be back :)Love this place!!! I've been going to Hooters for over 20 years and it never disappoints!! This new location is top notch, is always clean, and there's what seems like a rotation of new girls working every time I come! Add to that a newly vamped menu, pool tables, plenty of big screens, new wing flavors, and a good selection of Big Daddy sized beers on tap and you've got yourself a perfect getaway oasis in the desert!!!For fifteen years I believed that I was not an athletic person. (Tripping over one hurdle in high school brought me to this conclusion, but that's another story). After joining Allied Crossfit  3-4 months ago I can honestly say that I was wrong. I am athletic. That's huge for me, and it says a lot about Allied Crossfit, because I believed that lie about myself for fifteen years.

Here's a list of things that made me change my mind about myself.

1.Gareth-He's the owner of the gym. He's also the heartbeat that pulsates throughout the facility. Gareth is motivated by a passion for Crossfit and what it stands for, and it's contagious, because he's passionate about the sport, his staff, and the membership. It motivates me and encouraged me to keep going. 

2.Trainers- All of the trainers are knowledgeable, observant, and encouraging. I trust the instruction they give me, and they encourage me to push myself every day. Anyone can claim the role of 'trainer' at a 'gym', that doesn't mean that you should trust them. The trainers at Allied Crossfit are not posers. They are legitimate trainers you can trust. Their expertise has made me better, and has built my confidence in my athleticism.

3.Members- Everyone supports each other no matter what. You don't have to be ashamed of your fitness level. There are people of all shapes, sizes, and fitness levels in the gym. There have been a couple of days where the encouragement of the members got me through the workout.

I am forever changed by Allied Crossfit, and I'm thankful for it. I could go on and on. You have to experience it to get it. Stop in, and I'll chat with you about it. If I'm not there, talk to Gareth, or the trainers, or the members. We're a friendly bunch!Wow. I was not sure what to expect when we came here on Saturday night. We live nearby and have seen a few restaurants try out this location and not make it very long. But we love Hawaii and anything tropical so when we saw a place called Coconuts we had to stop in. Holy moly this place was incredible. 

The service: friendly but not intrusive. 
Atmosphere: casual (order then sit and they bring food to you). 
Food: Hawaii in your mouth. 

The coconut shrimp was light, fresh and flavorful. The fish tacos were heavenly. One server told us people in Maui wait an hour to get these tacos and I understand why now! I will be back. Awesome patio too. You gotta try this place!Absolutely LOVE the place! When I walked in, the atmosphere felt like a little coffee shop with tables and seats where you can actually sit down and look at the JUICE menu until you are helped. I tasted the Watermelon and OMG..... it was YUMMY! It didn't have that candy taste to it. It actually tasted like freshly squeezed watermelon! I ended up getting that in a 30 ML, extra flavoring. I was very impressed with the prices on the 30 ML. It was about $16. Next time I'm gonna have to try different juices. 
This location was an older crowd which I liked unlike at the other vape shops I've been to. I felt very comfortable and welcomed here. They even had complimentary coffee for the guests while you wait. While I was here, I met some cool people and all I gotta say is......  it's a small world! LoL!I have had the vegan, the vegetarian, and chicken arepa.  They were fantastic.  Pure yummy goodness!Great Mexican food and generally a short wait. We have come here multiple times since this location opened. We have enjoyed the food and like to sit on the balcony when the weather isn't too bad. The wait staff is young but attentive. We will continue to come here frequently.Yum! Large portions and very friendly staff.In my opinion you can't beat these guys for the price. They did a perfect job of matching a custom lavender color that was on my daughter's VW beetle. Fredy stands by his work.  Two thumbs up!If they don't have what you want, they'll find you one. My family has purchased two vehicles from these guy's over the past few years. Reliable used cars at good prices. Looking for a newer vehicle for Mom. Ask for Heath!!This place is always amazing!  The brioche buns are out of this world and they have one of the best Cuban sandwiches I have ate in Vegas!  We have had most of the items in the bakery case and they have all been excellent. You can't go wrong with anything here. Great service also!Chris was fantastic, came in and scrubbed our virus in less then 20 minutes!   I highly recommend him....When my computer crashed all I could think to do was go out, buy a new one, and lose all my documents, pictures, and data I had saved over the years.  But, I didn't do that.  I called Chris at SpeakGeek.  Chris was not only able to fix the crashed part but was also able to recover all my stuff. All of the pictures of my now 3 year old since birth.  All my important documents.  Everything was back.  I never signed up with a backup site or even backed up my info.  I lived in a "that won't happen to me world because I don't go to 'those' sites and don't download videos or music".  It can happen to you.  Call SpeakGeek anytime you need a professional, courteous, and knowledgeable computer guy.  Chris speaks geek so I don'tBacon board and apple pie moonshine. Nuf said.Yea, I know. I'm the guy that ordered a burger at a BBQ place. Glad I did. It was fantastic. Perfectly cooked with a great blend of toppings.  I'm definitely a burger junkie and this is in my top 3. 

My friend had the bacon plate. Like nothing I've seen. Delicious. 

The ambience also helps. I hate places that are too bright or so dim you can't see your meal.  This place is just right. 

Our service might have been a bit slow for some people. But I prefer not to rush my dining experience.  If you are in a hurry, don't go out to eat. 

The menu has lots to choose from. I'm excited to try the rest of the items on the menu.She is ammmmaaaazing... She is talented and artistic.. Knows how to make you look your best... Fast and reliable.Can't wait to go back ! 

I had been wanting to try this place out after driving by and seeing the word soups I am a huge soup fan & this place does not disappoint !!

Their mushroom bisque is literally the best creamy mushroom soup I have ever had and I highly recommend it  . . &  their tomato basil although different than most place's is unique and pretty good  . .  they also will let you sample all the soups before you choose one if you choose to do so !!

They also have a vast range of salads and sandwiches that you can watch being made in front of you 

I got the crab and avocado hot panini with munster cheese and it was delicious i dunked it into that awesome mushroom soup haha  . . 

And my order came with fresh bread & gianttt fresh and delicious chocolate covered strawberries for free !  . . 

I didn't try their salads but they all looked really good   . . I also had a passion fruit mango iced tea which was great 

The lay out is modern and clean and you can watch the chefs through a glass wall cooking the soups !! They are made fresh daily and have a huge selection 

they also had a bunch of desserts like fresh berry custards and cheesecakes etc. for display that all looked awesomeThese guys know their beef!! Never had a better day at the butcher than I have here at The Butcher Block! Their deli sandwiches are DELISH and easy to pick up on the way out to mountains or the lake. Love it here!My husband and I had a blast shopping through the great deals at this newish premium outlet...not too crowded...up to par with some of the best (could give Palm Springs a run for their money). Found great deals in Banana, Jones NY, Coach, Mikey K's, Sacks....all of em!!Great tasting flavors, good selection of tanks and batteries but above all else, this place has the best employees. They know what they're talking about, they're always friendly and helpful and this is easily my #1 favorite vape store. We had a leaky pro tank 3, and they checked it out for us and found out the glass was warped! Manufacturer defect, just bought it, and they just went ahead and replaced it. Always leave this place happy.The beer selection is weak but o m g the nachos are seriously to die for.  Every bite is perfect and it comes with a lot.  I ended up taking the leftovers to go even though I knew the chips would be all soft and limp.  The next morning just woke up and went straight for them without even heating it up.  Flavor was still delicious cold. Also got the champ burger which was also good but the bun got a little soggy so was a little difficult to hold.  Will for sure be back for those nachos.Frost Bites is amazing! I have never had anything like it, it has the taste of ice cream but is very light. And the flavored taste very natural, and the service is very good!Absolutely phenomenal!!!! I was mesmerized by every single performance. Don't listen to ANYONE on here who says otherwise. How is it possible to bitch about this show??? The production and the choreography was mind blowing. Seriously, it was candy to my eyes and ears. What an incredible tribute to the King of Pop!!! GO SEE IT!!!!Amazing!!!!! Very diverse menu and fresh food! The atmosphere is very nice and lively. The place is clean and the owner is very friendly..... This is a Restaurant I will DEFINITELY be eating at again!!! I highly recommend people to come and eat here!Came for the first time, well after the lunch rush (3pm) so there was no wait.  I can see how parking and ordering may become hectic at peak hours.  From its location and size, you'd be convinced it was a commercial office space in its past life.  Though it is 'cozy,' the lay out proves the space is used optimally, and the artistic details make for a unique setting.

Order at the counter, then grab a number and a seat.  The menu provides an interesting take and variety on [namely] American cuisine.  Me and my late lunch date tried something from the 'healthy' side and the 'happy' side.  The Slow Boat to China is essentially a chicken & cucumber salad, with a few other veggies, nuts, and a glaze that most closely resembled eel sauce.  It is presented as a boat (thus the name), and tasted like a California Roll.  I enjoyed it, though questioned how 'healthy' it really was on account of the sauce.  I also ordered a side of sweet potato fries, which were prepared to a crisp--and delicious! From the 'happy' side, we ordered the Benedict Burger with truffle fries.  It was rather well done, but still juicy, considering.  I am a sucker for eggs on a burger, so I liked it before I even tried it.  It had the usual veggie fixins plus avocado.  Not a burger I absolutely must have again, but a tasty, well made burger.  Likewise, the accompanying truffle fries were pretty good, but nothing different from any truffle fries I've tried before.  Granted, we were not so adventurous with our selections; We came more for necessity than foodie experimentation [and left very satisfied].  Next time, I will give one of their Philly Cheesesteak options a spin, as well as their loaded fries.  The photos and descriptions look amazing.

The portions are pretty large/definitely shareable.  Bonus points for flavored ketchup options! The jalapeno one was my favorite.  Service was great.  Staff is friendly.  I would definitely take friends and family here.Clay Forsberg is without a doubt, one of the most skilled, caring practitioners you could ever have the pleasure of having work on your case. I was so distraught and upset with my situation that was so traumatic, when I first encountered him in the ER and then afterward at his offices.  He reassured me and gave me his time and consideration as though he had all the time in the world and really listened to my concerns.  The surgeries he performed went very well and I knew and know now that I made the right decision having him be my doctor.  You couldn't  be in more skilled or caring hands.  He is truly a wonder and I am thrilled to write this review!!
Sincerely,

Stephanie Hales
http://stephhales.avonrepresentative.com/I have loved eating at Kneader's every time we go to Utah now I'm so happy to have them local! My only complaint is that they aren't closer to me. 

I went for lunch during the first week they opened, the staff was amazing and helpful and the food was great! My kids both had kids combos, my eldest literally drank every last drop of his chicken noodle soup, I ordered the Chicken Ala Mondo salad and my Mom (1st trip for her) ordered the Turkey Bacon Avocado on Focaccia. We were all impressed, the kids sugar cookies were so good we had to go back and get more. 

Next trip there will be for breakfast, can't wait for the french toast!!Went today for an early lunch. We enjoyed ourselves and enjoyed almost all of our food. The reason I gave them five stars is because when one of the servers picked up our dishes she noticed we hadn't eaten the soup. She asked if we enjoyed the chicken tortilla soup and I told her it was too chili based which I am not a fan of. What I didn't expect was for them to remove it from our check. That was a big suprise and unexpected. Great customer service, so lets take a step back and talk about the food. We ordered their lunch special which allowed us to order two tacos each and either soup or a half of their salads (3 interesting ones to choose from). I ordered the baja fish and the ahi tuni with a half salad. My husband ordered the standard chicken and the braised beef taco with the chicken tortilla soup at $9.95. As we waited we enjoyed their homemade chips and salsa that had a little kick (yummy). I also ordered a yummy virgin aqua fresca (pineapple). The only disappointment was no free refills on the aqua fresca (but it was to be expected as they will also make them with alcohol). The salad had papaya in it and was a bit overdressed but thank goodness for a light tasting vinagrette. Overall, we will defintely be back. We also left feeling it was the right proportion of food. Joyride is on the other side of Postino's and also to the left of Oregano's. so many places to choose from in Gilbert but when in the mood for tacos I definitely recoomend Joyride.I went with a friend to this location and the good was delicious. The firefly fries are seriously the best fries I've had I fell in love. Nahum took care of is for the night and he was on point with his service. He suggested just the right things to try and he was every attentive. Thanks for the great experience.Back in the day I went to the location on Scottsdale a couple of times and I loved it so I paid a visit to the DT Phoenix location and I believe it's even better.

Great decoration, wonderful staff, knowledgeable and kind waitresses (Kiera was super kind) and really good food.

The caprese salad was superb, hands down.

I also had the Pomo pizza which was very good.

The chef (I believe he's the owner) is super kind and he stopped by our table to greet and invite my friend and I a shot of a liquor that was pretty tasty and also shared some kind of desert which was also pretty good.

A funny fact is that all the floor staff were women (beautiful and super kind women).

BTW the bar looks pretty cool as well, could be a good place for a happy hour for two.

I'll be back soon.

CheersPete is awesome! He's very punctual and does a great job! He replaced all my locks at my new home with no problem at all and has the best price out there... Thanks Pete!This place ROCKS!  Stopped in around 10:20AM and was happily surprised they were open so early, as I'd rather give a locally owned restaurant the business over a chain any day.  

We ordered the grilled veggie pita and a small jalapeno hummus w/falafal and split both; EXCELLENT choices!  They were served very hot, the sauce on the pita was delish and the service was impeccable.  We have a PJ 5 mins. from the house, which is also awesome, but this place will def. be worth the extra drive for delicious food served quickly, hot, and with a smile.

We'll be back!!Always fresh food and the waitress staff are really on the ball there service outweighs the  food always smiling,always courteous, and funny thing you never have to ask "Where is our waitress?"  You don't get even that at a ritzy placeI received their flier at my door. Decided to pick up a sandwich before my 12 hour shift. I ordered at 10 am and it was ready before 10:30 as I told them I needed it before heading in to work. I ordered  the chicken parmesan and some garlic knots. I was really impressed with the parm sandwich. The sauce was great, the bread had a chew to it that I really liked. The chicken was breaded and suited the sandwich well. 

The garlic knots had a good flavor but wasn't the best that I've had. Maybe they were a little over-baked. The menu looks real extensive to include pasta, calzones, desserts, sub sandwiches and various appetizers. They even have ribs!! Other unexpected menu items are burgers, wings and fingers. 

They deliver with a minimum order of $10. 

If their Pastrami sandwich is as good as the Parm, this place will be seeing a lot of me.We are BIG fans of Crazy Pita, but this place is better.  Better pita bread, chicken and beef were both good.  Basmati rice was nice.  Baba ganash best ever.  More food than we could eat.  Very friendly owner run, everything cook fresh.   We will be back - many times....Great food and great service! Really enjoyed our meal. Took my mom here
For her birthday and she enjoyed it too. Will definitely come back. Love the steak salad, clam chowder, clam
Pasta and portobello fries!What the heck is a Russian dumpling. 
(my thoughts as I entered Paul's Pel'meni)

It is good. That's what.

These little dumplings o goodness make for one hearty and satisfying dish. As a meat and potatoes gal, these little pel'meni are excellently balanced between my need for some protein and my craving for some tummy-filling carbs. 

Plus, the flavor of these guys is so crazy good. Top the ground beef and potato with a drizzle of butter...vibrant yellow curry powder..sweet chili sauce..fresh chopped cilantro..and a dollop of sour cream..forget about it. 

I be back. And soon.I was lucky to score major discount tickets for this show. I didn't know what to expect, and turned out it was a great show and I wouldn't mind to pay full price on it!! Veronic is super talented and I'm still amazed at how she can impersonate so many singers out there! AND, she does it sometimes 2-3 times a night! The theater was awesome too - Not too small/big and I think every seat is a good seat. Fantastic show - I love it because this is what Vegas is about - Singing, dancing & having a great time!Great food, fun and entertaining for the entire family. We love the decor and the service is excellent.Delicious, cheap food. The staff are really nice, hardworking people.Ramen is amazing. Tonkatsu ramen...YUMMY!!  Always add an egg...they cook it perfectly!  Love their fried rice  and had the tonkatsu cutlet for the first time...literally the best I've had.  Good sauce on the side and a great cabbage salad too!  Comes with the tonkatsu!  Come try it. Great prices...good people!I love this little store !!!Even more so that they are located in Tivoli Village, which happens to be one of my growing favorite spots to dine in Vegas.

So glad they opened a location in Vegas. 
I loved coming to this little boutique whenever I visited Santa Monica. They are based out of LA and have multiple locations all over socal. 

They have really cute, unique styles here. Hip and with the current trends, but not too tacky looking like forever 21 can be at times. Very good prices. They always have some kind of sale promotion going on in the store. I bought a really cute maxi dress here for 40 bucks( original price 50, there was a 20% off sale for all dresses).

The staff is great. They are helpful but not overbearing. The only thing I hate about ANGL is their return/exchange policy. No refunds only store credit within 14 days. So make sure you try on and like what you decide to buy. 

If you're a shopaholic you have to at least have to check it out once. 
I hope that more shops like ANGL start popping up in this area.Great mixology. These folks are so creative.  Smoking skull whiskey.
Talk to Erick and Mercedes tell them what you like and they will hook you up with an awesome cocktail. I love bringing new people here.My wife and I had the occasion to trip into this place to cap off our night and did not regret it. We tried pretty much all the apps on the menu, and can say they were excellent. I thought the pot pie nuggets and tater-tots would be odd, but were both pulled off well. Pastrami sliders and bacon quail egg hors d'oeuvres were stylish and tasty. Rick came out later in the evening to mingle with the patrons (even though he was leaving in the morning for Vancouver), and sat to BS food with our group for much more than a minute. He even took my half drunk, untrained back-yard chef, joking and teasing with stride, and dished back a few of his own jabs. (Rick, you have my card. Hit me up and we will talk oysters again.) Great vibe. Great entertainment, and great way to end the evening out. Thanks again Rick.You have to try the Mac & cheeseI'm typically more of a passerby on sites like this, gleaning information and moving swiftly onward... But here I'm finally pausing to write my first (short and sweet) review because I just love this place so...

Grampa's makes an amazing pizza, but what I'm always blown away by is the specials.  Salads, pastas, special pizzas, soups, all of it.  Any time there's a special I order it, and I've never been disappointed.  There is so much thought put in to each dish and each pizza.  The staff is wonderful and friendly.  The restaurant is clean and cozy (and gorgeous to boot).  Thanks for doing what you do, Gramps, and welcome to the neighborhood!This is a dolphin sanctuary.  There is no dolphin show!!  These are rescued animals that allow you to appreciate their beauty with their cheery smiles and gregarious nature!!

Willow was our Yoga teacher and she was awesome! One thing I've learned over the years is Yoga is totally different based on the instructor...and she was great!  It wasn't a cheesy Vegas Yoga disco spin...It was true Yoga that allowed us to recharge from all of the craziness of the strip. I was there for a b-day party and needed a little alone time to regroup.  The dolphins were an amazing added bonus.  They see you as you see them. They are such beautiful social creatures that they actually come to the glass to watch you. They were so beautiful and awe inspiring that I wish I could just be there forever.  These dolphins are used for education and to aid autistic children.  Because of the stimulus of seeing people, they limit the yoga classes.  I found this to be a very respectful dolphin sanctuary that reminded me of the beauty of this world and of nature.Perfect eggs which is definitely a reason to get excited. The bread was of better-than-average quality. That came out as toast. The chicken fried steak. Mm. Good or very good service.I concur with most of these reviews! Great food and service.

Shakes are unbelievably GREAT!!!! Get the one with pretzels in it, the classic sweet and salty in a milkshake.

They have turkey, chicken and veggie selections that are actually GOOD!! LOL!!

Got to talking to the server, they had 1,000 applications, hired 100 and trained them 9 days before they opened. So they know about the food and how it is prepared.

Will make it a point to stop by again in the near future!!I have had many (and I mean MANY) more visits to Mary's lovely little milk bar since my first review and I'm feeling rather cruel for only having rated it four stars first time round. 

I love this little shop. I talked about how cute it was in my last review and it certainly has become a firm favourite of mine (and many of my friends). Mary always has a fantastic range of flavours and if you follow her on Facebook you can get a sneaky peek at what's in store each day. I should warn you, however, that this may result in many more visits to the milk bar than you had previously planned!

I have tried all sorts of flavours but favourites include: fig and honey, rice pudding, banana and peanut butter and good old traditional milk.

As well as ice creams Mary also does delicious hot chocolate and lovely little chocolatey goodies.

I would thoroughly recommend a visit.This restaurant was beyond amazing! I can't stress enough how excellent the food and customer service was. Immediately upon opening the door we were greeted and seated right away. The host was very friendly and seated us in a nice private like table that wasn't too far from the Hibachi table. The restaurant was dimly lit and the the decor was great while the Jazz music soothed you.
        This was my first experience eating at a Japanese Steakhouse and could barely pronounce most of the food on the menu. We couldn't have gotten a better waiter, Louis was awesome and by the end of the night my boyfriend was thanking him and shaking his hand lol.  He had outstanding customer service and was very knowledgable about the menu and even suggested items that he thought we would like. He did not disappoint! I can't even remember everything I had lol. I had the Alaskan King Crab Sushi Roll and Tempura Shrimp. While my boyfriend had the sautéed octopus and a bunch of other things. Sorry I forgot to take pics...I saw that food and just had to dive in. The prices were very reasonable and I am definitely going back...Groupon or not.Top notch food and service..wife and I drove from uptown and well worth the effort! Will definitely be back!!My husband is from Michigan and gets homesick often and I FINALLY found a place that brings him back home!Really nice peeps (;  all natural & house made.  Nice place too (:  refreshing find in Vegas!Great gelatos.  Inventive flavors with standard flavors too for those with more traditional tastes (like me).  I loved the cinnamon roll with a perfect balance of cinnamon.  Friends loved the pistachio, pear & Gorgonzola, and others I can't remember.  I also enjoyed the chocolate chip cookie -- which didn't taste like another version of cookie dough.  One person got half white coffee bean and half chocolate and thought the combination perfect.  The owner's, Desyree's, sense of taste is excellent.  Everything was well balanced, and not excessively sweet (though I can enjoy excessively sweet).

A group of us were visiting Las Vegas.  After finally stopping here (finding it from a Yelp search, thank you all!), we returned almost every day.  And we made AoF the last stop before we went to the airport to fly home.

This is gelato.  It's not custard (though it's a stone's throw from Luv It).  If you want that rich, thick eggy emulsified texture, you might be a little disappointed.  I make gelato at home without using eggs or custard, so this is perfect for me.

A warning about parking.  There's not much of it, and it's very tight.  I suspect this place is going to be booming by summer.  It'll be tough to get into and out of. 

If you're a tourist without a car, is it worth it to take the Deuce bus up and back?  Oh, yeah!  This is five stars for those that love gelato. 

My only complaint: the flavors rotate.  I never got to try chocolate mousse or nutella.  And I did not jump on lemon pound cake when I had the opportunity!  All the more reason to keep going back.

I've been to a number of artisan ice cream places in Northern California in the last couple of years and they've all fallen short.  This did not.  AoF has earned every 5 star review it's gotten.First, I love the concept (like Chipotle, but for pizza). Second, I love the garlic pizza "sauce" -- I think it's just garlic and olive oil. Third, I love that they have gluten-free crust and will actually clean the oven before they cook your gluten-free pizza!!!! (Luckily, I'm just allergic -- not celiac -- so I did not have to take them up on THAT, but how cool that they'll do that!) And finally, the food itself was delicious. Yum!This is a wonderful, cozy place.  My hubby and I have been there a few times now.  All visits have been great.  The last one, we invited one of our friends who lives in the neighborhood to join us.  He was so pleased.  We started at happy hour, their HH deals are great.  I had the arancini, so delicious.  The risotto balls filled with mozzarella and then deep fried and with a reduction of balsamic on the plate, what is not to like.  Creamy inside and crunchy outside, did I mentioned they are deep fried?  We also had the Short Rib Bruschetta and the arugula salad.  Our friend arrived after HH so he ordered a salad that is not on the menu anymore :(, it was a deconstructed salad with salmon.  My hubby also had a pizza.  I wouldn't go there for pizza, since there are so many other places that do just pizza, but the rest of the items are amazing and don't miss the bread and butter bread pudding.  It is AMAZING.  Can't wait to go back.Bought a groupon and did this on a Sunday night after two of my friends got married in Vegas. This was an excellent activity choice! While most of the spots on our tour didn't have drink specials (same ones as outlines in Traci's post), my favorite was them taking us to the club Body English, where we danced our asses off. While true that we weren't on the bus often or long, we had unlimited drinks on the bus and there were several fun options like margaritas. Our guide/bartender was awesome. This is a great activity for young people in Vegas who want to have a good time with other partiers.They have some things to work on, but I'm giving 5 stars because I've never gone to a dim sum place in town that I really wanted to go back to of my own free will. 

First, a little history of my dim sum perspective. Since I was young I've gone to the best dim sum restaurants in San Francisco with my parents, and since coming to Las Vegas we've also tried practically every dim sum joint in town available. Cathay, KJ's in Rio, PingPangPong, Orchid's, Chang's.... The only time I go is when my parents are in town and it's all the same to me. The best communication is in Mandarin or a dialect, otherwise its pointing at things. There are a variety of dishes, lots of shrimp based things, many dishes are very salty, very heavy, very oily. I don't like any of those latter points. 

I'm not saying that Dim Sum Cafe food is bland. Not at all! But in comparison to all the others, it is not so heavy that it makes me want to stop eating after a few tries. It also seems to be less oily and heavy than other places I've tried. 

One big thing I really like is that you can order dim sum any time of the day and they make it to order so its hot and fresh, not on a cart for who knows how long. This does mean it will take a little bit for your food to come out, but it's worth the wait to me. I was initially a little wary since another review said it was a sister of Orchid Garden, who gave me cold dim sum so I never went back. Fortunately, nothing was cold, stale, or old here. The quality seems to be quite good, and everything tastes great. 

There are some Chinese only speaking employees there, but they do their best and mean well. It did take a little while to be noticed and seated, and service seems a little bit slow depending on which server you get. It might be a little bit of language barrier, a little shortage of staff, a little less experience with customer service, but whatever it is a little training or hiring of experienced servers would smooth these bumps quickly. 

For a Saturday night there were not many people there. I don't know if it was the location or that it's still a new place, but I hope they can make the right improvements and stay in business so that I can keep having dim sum that doesn't overwhelm me!I have had 2 different sessions with Olivia and absolutely love her work. She is very creative, professional, and great with kids. She was able to make my son very comfortable so we could get some great shots of him. The pictures are very high quality and she takes as much time as you need to go over all of the pictures taken and options available. I ordered a book and some photos for the wall and constantly get compliments on them. Olivia's work is amazing and I will continue to have her photography my family.I only came here for brunch and it was....Awesome. For a nice steakhouse restaurant, their brunch menu was pretty affordable. I ordered their short rib hash and it was very tasty. Equally tasty was their smoked salmon  eggs benedict. I would love to come back and try their dinner menu someday. They also have a butcher on site  so you can buy yummy meats and cold cuts from them. Service was friendly and very attentive.This is the best spot to find affordable and trendy costume jewelry. If you're looking for a pair of earrings, a bracelet or a necklace to match an outfit within a budget, then this is the place. 

They have items organized by color family, including gold, silver and bling. 

This is also a great spot for a purse, iPhone case or cute top. The quality isn't top notch, but you can't beat the price.First time having a Brazilian wax, it was kinda painful but I love the results. She gave me helpful tips to control the irritation. I will be seeing her again in about 5 weeks :) Thanks again!Outstanding customer service! Our visit was quick and the staff was knowledgeable and helpful! Dr. Pearson was personable and took the time to explain everything to my daughter and to me. Highly recommend!!The cocktail I ordered was perfect-o, while the Jamaican Jerk baked wings were sooooo flavorful. Their pizza/crust is some of THE best I've had.  The best part?!?!  Their prices!  Great food/atmosphere for the  buck!  Will def be back!!I'm going against my own rules here (writing a review not only before I've tried it twice, but before I've finished the first meal!!), but this place is... Not just ONE word to describe it! This place caught me by surprise. Here's why:

When I pulled up to the front, I thought, it's nothing special to look at, basic strip mall sushi place. I walked in and the setup is modest, almost unsure of itself. I looked at the menu and saw that there weren't MANY options, but I stayed positive. I was meeting a friend there who had been there the night before and asked me to go with her tonight again so there must be something about this place...

She arrived and we began ordering our basic favorites. For me, it's just a simple Philly roll. She warned me that if I didn't like smoked salmon, to ask for fresh. When I try somewhere new, I like to try new things but I gauge how far I'm willing to go by the predictable. "If I don't like the smoked salmon, I'll stick to the beginner rolls" is what went through my mind. After the first bite of "beginner" Philly roll, I realized, this is the big league. Beyond fresh. Strip quality. Local pricing. I. WANT. MORE.

I ordered a Firecracker roll, which sounds like it may be spicy, but Sushi Chef John Lee (the owner and head sushi chef of Soho, previously known as executive chef of Social House at Crystals CityCenter, whom I also had the honor to meet and speak with at length) knows his fish pairings. The Firecracker roll was the perfect amount of spicy, sweet, crunchy, and smooth. It found itself somewhere between amazing and incredible on my scale of taste. Best of all, though, it was $9. I immediately had doubt that I would find anything better on the menu. BOOOYYYYYYY was I in for a ride!!!

My friend ordered a Spicy Soft Shell Crab roll because she only got one piece the day prior due to her party eating it all. Ha! Needless to say, I only got one piece of that one too! So I ordered my own as well. WOW. Normally I'm hesitant about soft shell. I've had a few questionable experiences with it and I feel like I'd rather just not take the chance again but this make... "Speechless" is what comes to mind. Trust me on this if nothing else, TRY IT. Take one bite and you'll understand.

Aside from the sushi rolls, we also ordered Angus Beef Tataki. I've had it before at another Japanese restaurant in Vegas and LOVED it. Sushi Chef John Lee creates all his own sauces, many which use citrus as an ingredient. He paired the beef with a mild but savory sauce that can only be described as succulent. Presented beautifully like all his plates, I almost feel bad that I destroyed it. :D

We ordered several more dishes (WAYYY too many to describe right now) and they're all borderline orgasmic. I toughed it through to manage a dessert as well due to a picture I saw on yelp of a Green Tea Tiramisu. Being part Italian and having lived in Italy for 4 years, I can judge harshly on any food claiming to be "Italian" or using "Italian ingredients or methods"... I'll say it fast... Italy should take note... This dessert was shocking. Green Tea.... Tiramisu.... It's a combination that could rival the tastebud tickling that José Andrés has done at China Poblano at The Cosmopolitan. Not bashing him at all, I find him to be an incredible magician of food, but this sole dessert is something else. Something intriguing. Now only to avoid the mafia from here on out...

Just prior to leaving (we had stayed a measly 2.5 hours... NBD...), Sushi Chef John Lee asked how everything had been for us, to which we applauded and both agreed to write 5 star reviews. Then he said, "Thank you, but all I want is for you to leave happy, having enjoyed the food that I can make for you." So I replied, "Well, I'm leaving sad.... But it's only because I have to leave." He laughed and thanked us again and we departed.

Lastly, thank you Bobbi for taking me here! And if you'd like to "duke" it out for that crown, I'm all yours baby! ;)I have been here a few times. I have had pizza, garlic knots, and their peperoni rolls a few times. This is probably the closest non major chain pizza place to my house. The staff are all very nice although their delivery takes a long time for as close as I live (Less than one mile from their store front). The food is always very good. Not the best but WAY better then any major chain pizza.Very delicious food and great prices. We read the great reviews and decided to give it a try.  The tacos are amazing.  The carne asada fries are definitely a must have as well.The owners Travis and Tida and the rest of their staff have done such an amazing job on this place. I was just looking for a cool and chill place with a patio that served some craft beers but this place offers so much more. The feeling, the atmosphere, the music, the friendliness of everyone (staff and patrons) makes this place a home away from home. I just can't wait till the back patio/common area opens soon! Keep up the great work and keep those awesome drinks and craft beers coming. Wish I was a coffee drinker because I have no doubt that is amazing as well.Who knew Elton John has a bar in Vegas! The decor totally reminds me of the. 70's, with its chandeliers, beautiful bar stools with faux (or real) fur. 

The drinks, not too expensive ($18) compare to other champagne bars, was the highlight of my evening. Fantastic! The Le Fizz drink was so smooth and delicious. Sane with the margarita speciality cocktail. 

The staff are beautiful, both guys and gals. And they are actually quite friendly too. 

Bonus is when you check in via yelp, there is a 2 for 1 specialty cocktail deal. Love it. 

Check this place out if you are at Caesars.My favorite bbq was Don & GGs in Ironwood, MI (and it is still worth the 5 hour drive from Madison); however, they only have ribs. That BBQ Joint is the  best and most versatile. I've tried the ribs, brisket, whole chicken, and some special items. Tonight, it was the signature sandwich, TBJ, along with the Italian Beef and Chicken Wings. All three were superb. The wings were smoked to perfection and needed nothing but the rub. The TBJ is a version of the Cuban and the homemade mustard sauce mixed perfectly with with the meats--the panini bread was crisp and added to the overall texture. The Italian Beef (I went with mild peppers) was incredible. Perhaps the best roast beef that I have ever tasted. The bread stood up to the au jus so that utensils were not needed. 

For the mainstays, the homemade sauces are incredible, but try the food without the sauce first just to allow the rub to shine. 
The sides are all well done as I have had them, but the meats are the stars.
Pricing is very fair and reasonable and you can sample with single ribs and chicken wings. A great addition to the neighborhood and Madison's food scene.This place is amazing! I've been accused of being a fanboy for Butt Out but Matt has always gone out of his way to earn every bit of appreciation and Mill is no different! The style, vibe,  and character of this shop are top notch and I have been in hundreds of shops across the nation. Not only is the customer service the best but so is the juice. 2 enthusiastic thumbs up for another spectacular iteration of Butt Out.Love this place, great pizza!!  Great prices, clean, friendly staff, dine here once a week.We are locals and eat out a lot. We love the food options around here. When it comes to sushi, we are pretty picky. Today we decided to try the new spot. All you can eat for $26. "Wow"!!! We were impressed with everything we tried. Especially the "Butter-fly" a unique roll with crab shrimp coconut and peanut butter. Sounds weird but it's a pleasant party in your mouth! Lol ;) coco shrimp and something wrong were great. Side dishes like short rib, different meat skewers and fried rice.. All Good! Great variety on the menu topped off with excellent service. They were attentive, friendly and very welcoming. We highly recommend DOH!Excellent service and amazing food!!!
I had a staff dinner last night, group of 15. We asked chef to create his own menu and we were surprised to have so many unique delicious rolls. I strongly recommend the Doh not only for someone who loves sushi but also for someone who does not eat raw fish. They have other amazing tapas and rolls without raw fish that everybody will appreciate. Highly recommend for big group!Heard about Which Wich from a friend and it was as good as he said it was. Ordered the Cuban sandwich and it was as good as it is in Miami. Loved the bread and the hot peppers. This is now our new favorite sandwich place.This place is awesome! Jimmy is a real cool dude. This is the cleanest haircut I've had in a while. I highly recommend this barbershop.Can not say enough nice things about this place! Brought my husband here after a family members recommendation. So decided to see if it would be husband approved and it was!  The owner and his wife can't do enough for you, they immediately make you feel welcomed. After speaking with his wife as my husband was getting his haircut, I felt as if I'd known them all my life. Just real neighborly down to earth people. Which is often hard to find in a big city. Jimmys exceptional talent and attention to detail really shows in the results of the cut! He really cares and takes pride in his work!  My husband gave up the military barber at Nellis after almost 19 years and made Jimmys his permanent barber!Nom nom!!  Oh how I love Cornfusion, let me count the ways!!  This place has everything ~ Popcorn, tons of flavors (I chose a mixture of cheddar, caramel, and garlic parmesan), gift containers, specialty sodas, shaved ice, fudge, caramel apples, cake pops, charming staff members, and comfortable seating for my friends and family members.  

As soon as we walked in, we were hit by the delicious smell of fresh, sweet popcorn and the colorful decor of the shop.  Then, the customer service = awesome.  Then, the popcorn and fudge = delish!  After I "accidentally" ate my entire bag, I ordered extras to share.  SUCH a treat after a long day of running errands with the kids :)Ohhh the ambience seeps through the old brick and timber!  I do love the feel of this place.  Is it the lighting?  

I gathered here with a few others to celevrate the 3rd birthday of Yelp edinburgh.  The company was lovely and the drinks were a flowing (lovely prosecco btw).

I'm defo coming back to try the pulled pork on the menu and maybe evrything else!! it all sounds delish!Awesome! This place is so cute and they made balloons for the kids when they asked for one :)Tiny but awesome casual place with burgers (grass fed beef!), sandwiches, and the most amazing hummus and pumpkin seed dips (yes really) with crudités.

You should also look at the the Post-It Note special (which changes weekly). Don't forget the (free!) French-sea-salt cookies on the way out, either.

You can either sit outside, or inside at the bar in a tiny, modern, almost-hipster-but-not-in-that-annoying-way round building (bathrooms are out back). Service at the bar was *great* and super friendly (free samples were offered of the hummus/pumpkin seed dips for example; also got told about the gelato sandwiches). They have a small menu of beer and wine. 

Only drawbacks; portions are smallish (burgers/sandwiches are stand alone so order sides if you're hungry) and prices are reasonablish but not cheap. That said, def making a return trip here next time we home Camelback.Chocolate Thunderdome...MmmmmM  These smoothies are so tasty and less sugary than the chain Smoothie places. It's located inside the Phartell Pharmacy. Both of the employees are so friendly and energetic. It was fun to hang out with them while enjoying the smoothie. :)Best Custard EVER!!! so fresh, creamy and delicious. Great place to sit and talk with friends.Very, very pleased with both the quality of the product and the customer service. Would definitely recommend this as a well-priced alternative to the other more expensive look-a-like product on the market.  Thank you for making our patio look spectacular!super super love this coffee shop! if you are looking for a good morning boost u must come  here and get your caffeine! i always look for a good crema on espresso and on my latte. ENOUGH SAID. love it.One of my favorite shows I've seen in vegas yet.
Small Venue, a REAL band with a terrific performance.
 A little crowd participation too. Lots of fun, will go back for the Evil Dead show!Years ago I went to New Orleans for Mardi Gras and while there fell in love with Louisiana cuisine. Po' boys, beignets, cafe au lait, gumbo, jambalaya and the many other dishes that originatedin the region. 

Having said that I visited  Streetcar Po' Boys today and was very pleased. From the moment we entered we were immediately greeted by the hostess (D'nis but pronounced Denise) and sat in our booth. We quickly made our selection starting with a nice cup of cafe au lait and some beignets. Both were very good and it reminded me of the ones I had at Cafe Du Mond in the French Quarter in downtown Orleans. 

My friend ordered the shrimp po boy and I had the catfish. According to the kitchen staff everything they make is made in house and the bread is ordered directly from New Orleans. And you definitely could taste it. 

My Catfish filet was very tasty. The breading was the right amount of crispy and flaky. On top of that they offered us a very tasty banana bread muffin - on the house for dessert. Can't go wrong with that! 

I'll definitely be back.This show was amazing! I enjoyed every sing minute of this high energy production and Britney looks fantastic as always! 
My only tiny complaint is that if you're in the back of the venue, it may be a little hard to see. I think they should add a live camera feed on big screens off to the side so you can see close ups throughout the show. But it's really not that bad because it's not a super huge venue. 
Be sure to get some Britney merch after the show! My favorites are the Britney Spears leggings that are only $40! Super high quality, comfy and adorable. 

You definitely need to see this show! And take me with you because I wouldn't mind seeing it again and again. :) 

~RachaelMy hair is ready for summer! Twelve weeks of smooth frizz free hair with a Brazilian blowout treatment. Sarah is a wonderful, cheery person filled with stories that pass the time. I left her salon feeling *very* purty.

As this was my first time having a Brazilian hair treatment Sarah carefully explained the process. Additionally she gave me a heads up prior to each step. I was surprised how glass like smooth my hair turned out. (Like silk!) 

The salon is located on the ground floor of "Salon Studios". (Next door to Moda Fina.) Sarah offers flexible hours - including Mondays!  In addition to the straightening treatments (Brazilian, Keratin, Japanese Straightening) standard salon options abound. Hair cuts, color, highlights, shampoo/blowouts & up-do's.  

I felt like I was visiting a friend vs. a generic salon. I smiled when I saw the wine glasses. (My kind of people!) 

I would keep an eye out on Groupon to nab a killer deal. You won't regret it!I love all their watches! Everything is packaged adorably so it's easy and fun to gift. I will definitely go back to the store for their amazing deals!The tuna poke is fantastic. Do yourself a favor and order this with some wonton chips to start. 

Also, have had Juan Carlos as a server multiple times. He is fantastic and will make sure you have everything you need.  

Great drink specials and amazing Mac and cheeseGreat service with a smile and donuts as good as I remember them from my childhood. Bosa has been in AZ since the 70's 

This brand new location is a welcomed  addition to Ahwatukee. They have seating inside and out. Inside there is a big screen TV to catch your local news with a cup of Jo and a donut for $2.99. 

Make sure and support this local business!My favorite place!! Good food. Good drinks and good people. My husband loves the Mexican pasty. I always love the side dishes. There homemade baked bread is to die for. So yummy. I also love there regular oven chips, broccoli and cauliflower bake, mushy peas w/ a side of sour cream. There side salads with pesto dressing is delicious. I always save room for their Banoffee pie. It's the best dessert ever. They slice fresh banana on top. I was also told you can ask for fresh strawberries too. Defiantly going to try that next time. Do yourself a favor Vegas and go check this tasty place out. You won't be sorry.I have been going to Matt to get my hair done since I moved to Vegas 4 years ago and I cant imagine anyone else touching my hair!  Matt and his team hands down have the best salon in town.  You will get the best customer service, the most talented hair stylists, and an overall fabulous experience. Cant wait to get my extensions soon!

I recommend this salon for everyone - all ages. You will not be disappointed!Simply delicious!  I'll be eating there often.  The big Al, dipped with provolone and hot peppers.Loved this place!  Food presentation rivals any 5-star restaurant. Service was great and friendly.  Food was fresh and flavorful. Decor was hip and modern. Definitely worth a repeat.What a FANTASTIC new place for downtown Phoenix!!! I predict this will be my new favorite place!!! I've been in 3 times and have had nothing but wonderful drinks, interesting but delicious food, and friendly service!!! The cocktails are all handcrafted and absolutely delectable!! My favorite is the Kaffir Lime served on the rocks! I have also enjoyed an Old Fashion and many others on the menu. Although it has Been packed a few times I've tried to go in.. It will not deter me from trying again. The food and especially the drinks are well worth it!We had a great experience with Bee Clean Pools LLC.  Casey was very professional and helped me save money by showing me how to do some things on my own.  When it was time to drain and refill the pool Casey even helped me by diggging around in my rocks to find the sewer clean out.  Good honest service at a great price!  My wife and my wallet couldn't be happier.  Thanks!We had a wonderful lunch on the patio of this new Yardhouse. Beautiful view of the High Roller and Linq. Plenty of beer selections and great lunch choices. The grilled pastrami and mixed field green salad was perfection. Husband had the French dip and clam chowder and he was impressed. The management stopped at our table to see how everything was, which was excellent. Mandy was our server and she was great, very efficient and detailed. We will be back..There is sooooo much food here, so come very, VERY hungry! And that was only lunch! We were told at the cashier's desk that there is more food at dinner time. We arrived at about 3:30 PM and lunch ends at 3:45 PM, so we were just in time for lunch. Thank goodness, since I can't eat that much anyway, so it would be a moot point for me to have even more food in the buffet lines (there are 6 food lines jam packed with delights). 

Lunch is $9.24 and dinner is $13.85 -- and I would say that it is well worth the price considering the amounts and variety of foods provided. They even have a self-serve yogurt area and a special section for desserts. There's a special area for sushi and hibachi selections but I really was much too stuffed to try anything from that area. It doesn't take much to fill me up, so buffets always make money on me.

Everything I tried was so very delicious and if I had more room, I would have eaten more (not! don't want to gain too much!)

Seriously, be sure to come here ravenously hungry and you will be satiated not only in your tummy but also on your palate!This place is a wonderful addition to Gilbert! Spencer, one of the owners, greeted us when we walked in and promptly got behind the counter to help us. The Salted Caramel Cake Bite was delicious! Just the right amount of sweetness after dinner. 

The desserts, decor and people are first-rate! I'll definitely be going back!West coast IPA. Amazing food. Dales pale ale. Amazing food. Stone IPA.  Amazing food.Let me first say that my husband is Chinese and we are pretty picky when it comes to eating out. This place is great! It has really authentic skewers which really remind me of BBQ in China. My favorite are the lamb skewers, but I liked the chicken and beef too. We got some mild and some spicy. The spicy ones were pretty spicy for me, but my husband said they were perfect! We also had the pot of shrimp and corn - YUM! You even get gloves to so there is no messy clean up after the peel-yourself shrimp. 

On our second visit we got the combination "rinse meat string." We had tofu, mushrooms, fish balls and some other kind of fish. They are amazing! I couldn't stop eating it. I would definitely get these again! I also love the plum juice which is tart and cold...perfect to cool the spice! We also had kids with us who loved the sweet potato fries! We got the VIP card and used it to save a bunch on our second visit. 

Overall, I will be back because:
1. The food is YUMMY! Authentic, spicy and great quality.
2. The VIP card offers a good discount
3. They are open LATE so we can go after work - which can be difficult since we get off work at midnight!!!There are a lot of "Vapor Lounges" in the area, but Innovative Vapors is the way to go ! Not only do they have the best prices, and the best selection, but they actually have a lounge and their staff is freaking awesome. If you go anywhere else, you are fooling yourself . Can't waitto go back !!!Great fresh cocktails, live music, compelling venue right at The Linq.  Retractable widows overlooking the walkway. A great place to spend the evening people watching and enjoying the weather.We decided to go to the Phoenix location for Father's day breakfast. Hubby saw them featured on Triple D.  While yes the wait was long (almost an hour) we felt the food was well worth it.Hubby and I don't like blueberries and I am not a real big fan of eggs, but their blueberry jam is so amazing I wanted to buy some to take home (which you totally can!). They even cooked my eggs the way I wanted (done very well) without me having to send it back to cook longer. The food was so much and so good that we couldn't finish, but we wanted to so badly. Will definitely come here again and wait.Jecika performed a GK taming system treatment (keratin treatment) on me on 10/31/13. It has been 4 months and it is still going strong! Well worth it! I started with very long, frizzy, curly hair. She used the "resistant" level on me. I was expecting it to smell bad or burn my eyes, but it didn't! It actually had no smell. Jecika was very professional and we had a blast chatting during the process. My hair used to take 30-45 minutes to flat iron. It took 5 minutes the first 2 months and now takes 10. I look forward to future treatments with her. This treatment has been life changing!Who knew you could get a delicious meal on the strip for such a great price.   Not tucked far back in a casino, but litterally steps from the Strip.   You order and then seat yourself, but you get real dishes and silverware (classy).  The food comes out fast, and tastes good (almost the best pizza that I have had from these gourmet pizza places popping up everywhere).  What's not to like?  Once word gets out, perhaps there will not be enough seating?I have followed Kim to her new adventure as owner of Sole Serenity because she is AMAZING. When I first found Kim I had acrylic nails and she did them for me a couple times and then suggested I go to gel polish with natural nails.  Can't thank her enough for that! I love my nails now!  Kim is professional, witty and most of all caring.  Her new digs are definitely serene, cozy and immaculate. You get top notch treatment and beautiful nails and toes.  Thanks Kim!Bad Beat Brewing is a sorely needed oasis in the sparse landscape of locally-owned brewpubs. Their dedication to quality and service will no doubt ensure a lasting legacy. 

As the first beer joint to open in Henderson's booze district, Bad Beat is setting the bar pretty high for their counterparts. These guys brew in the back, pour in the front, and strive to create a friendly atmosphere that invites customers to settle in for hours at a time.

There's no kitchen here -- these guys devote their attentions strictly to beer craft -- and the results truly shine through. The beer is delectable, and all the easier to drink in the bright atmosphere of their front taproom. Food trucks will queue up on weekends to alleviate any hunger pangs, and the owners invite customers to order delivery if the trucks aren't around.

Such considerations lend true character to these new establishments. I can't wait to make this place a regular stop.If you haven't been to this donut shop, you are missing out.  The donuts are made daily...really fresh and delicious.  If you haven't had a boba drink before...you should try one.  It is unique.  I like the taro flavor.
The ice coffee was made just as I asked.
The owner is there every time I've gone in.  She is so sweet :-)!  Family owned.
Just go :-)!After coming to Gaby's on a pretty regular basis since it opened a few months ago I've decided to give it 5 stars and let fellow Yelpers know about it. I hope many of you will stop in since I really want this place to make it. The food is so good. Had the pomodoro tonight. Delicious. Like grandma would have made, if I were Italian! Ce with a big salad and garlic bread. Great ambience. Super employees. Wonderful everyday happy hour from 4-7 in bar. Really good draft beer selection. All crafts, no crap. Wine list needs some more choices in my view, but they have several very drinkable reds and whites by the glass for just $5. $4 during happy hour. Overall I'm thrilled to have Gabriella's in my neighborhood. And I will be back, often.Liberty Home Repair is our go to for all our home improvements! Their talent, skill, reliability and prices are the reasons we continue to come back to them for all our handy man projects.  Thank you Dror for being so patient and honest with us.  We love our new kitchen and bathrooms!Yum.  Great food.  Great service- happy people.  It's always crowed but worth the wait -if you're in the mood.  The parking stinks- too many good businesses in the same lot.Love this place! 
Much better than Fresh and Easy, a little less cheaper than Whole Foods!

The store is very clean and organized!
Cashiers and workers are helpful and kind!

Sprouts provides fresh produce including fruits, vegetables, meats, seafood, baked goods, nuts, and grains! They also have a deli section-- providing a quick sandwich for lunch, if desired! 
Also lots of natural, organic, and gluten-free groceries to choose from!
None food related items they have are beer, wine, supplements and vitamins!

They have monthly deals and coupon books! Great place to definitely check out!Great clean atmosphere and friendly & helpful staff. It has a boutique hotel feel which I love. The hotel & casino is right on the strip. So you can't beat the location.I love Rony even though he is a damn Yankees fan! All kidding aside, if you want a good haircut and beard trim this is the guy. At my age I don't have a lot of hair on top to work with. But he does a great job on my beard makes me look respectable.
This is another Arizona small business success story, this man loves what he does and wants to be the best. I showed up after hours just as they were closing, I was getting ready to go out of town and he still took me in and did a great job. Thanks for all your hard work. You're the best!Checked this place out on first Friday. It was really well done, as someone who grew up in Vegas it was cool to see somethings familiar and others not as much. It's free everyone should stop by to at least check it out.These donuts are freaking amazing! This is the best new addition to the NW side and the worst for my waist line. The maple crullers are to die for, but get there early on the weekends because they sell out quickly.Love this place! Great coffee and great friendly staff! So happy they opened a location in SurpriseGreAt food awesome service . The best fish in town . Must go and check it out . The menu will blow your mind . Way too much to choose . They have something for everyone .
